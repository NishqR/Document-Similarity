The yellow metal, which breached $1,000 an ounce in March during the Bear Stearns debacle, could well return to that level and head toward $2,500 as investors scramble for safety, according to many fans of the yellow metal.

""It is premature to declare an end to the bull market in gold and the bear market in paper,"" John Hathaway, portfolio manager of Tocqueville Asset Management, pronounced in a missive last week. ""It is more likely that this massive shakeout has set the stage for a dynamic advance.""

Barron's Roundtable member Mark Faber puts it more succinctly: ""Gold will go up because everything else is in deep s--t.""

Investors can participate in the gold market in a variety of ways, such as purchasing mining stocks or mutual funds that hold them. But right now, those shares are vulnerable to heavy selling by hedge funds and others trying to raise cash. That's why many pros recommend that investors acquire the metal itself.

You can amass physical gold by purchasing gold coins from various governments; buying shares in the StreetTracks Gold Trust exchange-traded fund (ticker: GLD), which is backed by the metal; or buying gold on the Website goldmoney.com. Gold purchased there is stored in insured vaults, and the holdings are audited annually.

James Turk, founder of Goldmoney.com, sees gold at $1,100 or $1,200 an ounce by year-end. ""In a time like now, with markets melting down, uncertainty about the safety of assets and growing concern about counterparty risk, people look to assets with safe-haven status,"" Turk says. A longtime gold bug, Turk sees gold eventually hitting a dizzying $7,000 an ounce.

Charles Oliver, manager of the Sprott Gold and Precious Minerals Fund in Toronto, has a more restrained target of $2,000 within four years. But even that would be more than double the current price.

When it comes to gold, such movements aren't so unusual. Since Barron's penned a bullish piece on the yellow metal nearly three years ago, (""Golden Opportunity?"" Dec. 26, 2005) it's up nearly 60%.

The technical signals, too, favor a continued rise. One key measure -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average divided by the price of an ounce of gold -- has lately been flashing bullish at about 10, down from more than 40 around the turn of the millenium. In the past two cycles, ""gold did not peak, and the DJIA did not bottom until this ratio was in the low single digits,"" writes John Roque, managing director, market technician, for Natixis Bleichroeder.

As the accompanying chart shows, gold's outperformance against the blue-chip index -- shown by a declining ratio -- tends to last for a minimum of 14 years.

Mining shares can't be ruled out entirely. In fact, mining companies should soon benefit not only from high gold prices but declining energy tabs, which lower the companies' costs.

""Even if the price of gold fell in half, gold stocks would still be fairly valued,"" says Steve Lehman, senior portfolio manager of the $1.8 billion Federated Market Opportunity Fund, which counts names like Yamana (AUY), Barrick (ABX) and Newmont Mining (NEM) among its largest holdings.

Oliver, of Sprott Precious Minerals Fund, is partial to companies like Goldcorp (GG), which has some of the lowest-cost mines, and Iamgold (IAG), which, in his view, at $3.93 a share is trading at a discount to the sum of its parts. For those with a bit more of an appetite for risk, Oliver suggests Kinross (KGC), a $9 billion market-value company that he says is trading at a discount or close to its net asset value.

Another option: Market Vectors Gold Miners (GDX), an exchange-traded fund of gold mining and exploration companies.

As always, gold investing isn't without risks. Paul van Eeden, president of Cranberry Capital, a private holding company in Toronto, maintains that gold is ""already slightly overvalued.""

Though the Federal Reserve has flooded the economic system with dollars, which normally would stoke inflation, van Eeden believes that the central bank ""has mitigated a lot of the intervention by withdrawing funds out of the market."" Based on a benchmark he has devised, ""the actual money supply,"" gold should be trading at about $750 an ounce.

Faber, too, thinks gold is ""not particularly inexpensive,"" but given that you ""can't trust the banks anymore, I'm quite happy to buy gold."" He recommends purchasing physical gold and storing it in a safe deposit box in a country like his native Switzerland. Sounds like a plan.

U.S. District Judge T. John Ward of the Eastern District of Texas has earned a reputation for being plaintiff-friendly, allowing his courthouse to basically corner the market in U.S. intellectual-property litigation. His story has been well-documented. Plaintiffs tend to win a preponderance of cases brought before judges in Marshall, and East Texas juries have had a propensity to dole out multimillion-dollar awards like corn dogs at the state fair. Thus, regardless of where companies do business or where alleged patent thieveries have taken place, intellectual-property plaintiff lawyers flock to Marshall, which hasn't been kind to the deep-pocketed set in Silicon Valley. Google, Cisco Systems (CSCO) , Yahoo! (YHOO), Nortel Networks (NT) and Microsoft (MSFT) are among the scores of tech companies and telecoms that have defended themselves there. Yahoo! alone has been sued there more than 15 times since 2007. Jury verdicts in Marshall have cost defendants tens of millions of dollars-in some cases, more than $100 million -- not including court and attorney's fees.

But the times might be a changin' in Marshall. This month, in a case closely monitored by corporate lawyers far and wide, Volkswagen (VLKAY) won a U.S. appeals court ruling that could limit the ability to keep cases filed in the Eastern District from being moved to other federal courts. Volkswagen was sued for allegedly using defective parts in a car involved in a fatal crash. Because the crash occurred in Dallas, Volkswagen argued that it was more logical to try the case in that city, which was more convenient for witnesses.

Ward shot down Volkswagen's request-as he has so many similar ones- ruling that plaintiffs get to choose the location. Finally, an appellate court stood up and said ""enough is enough."" The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which includes Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, ruled recently that Judge Ward was wrong to reject Volkswagen's plea that its product-liability case should be moved to Dallas.

The 5th Circuit didn't come down easy, either. ""Concluding that the district court gave undue weight to the plaintiffs' choice of venue, ignored our precedents, misapplied the law, and misapprehended the relevant facts, we hold that the district court reached a patently erroneous result and clearly abused its discretion in denying the transfer,"" it ruled.

""Patently."" Get it? Even judges have a sense of humor. It's odd that the justice system let one court monopolize a segment of the law for so long.Nothing against the good people of East Texas, but why should the likes of TiVo and Echostar (now Dish Network) have to do legal battle in Marshall? Perhaps they won't have to in the future.

And with interest rates at rock-bottom levels, it's easier to structure a certain type of trust to your family's advantage. Here's how to make the most of it all.

If you ordinarily make your tax-free gifts to children and grandchildren around the holidays, consider handing out your 2009 gifts in early January, when you should still be able to give a large number of shares because of fire-sale equity prices.

Right now, you can give $12,000 to any one person without triggering a gift tax, and that limit climbs to $13,000 next year. In other words, if you make gifts in late December and early January, you could give each beneficiary a gift totaling $25,000. And a couple could give a total of up to $50,000 per beneficiary.

Let's say a couple owns shares of General Electric, which have plunged by 50% over the last year. With gifts totaling $50,000, the pair could give each of their beneficiaries roughly 2,500 shares, as long as the stock remains below $20 through early January. That's about double the number of shares the couple could have given if they had made back-to-back gifts last year. If you think GE's stock will recover in the coming years, then your heirs will enjoy all those gains without paying estate taxes.

Unlike with an inheritance, your heirs will not get a stepped-up cost basis on shares you give them now. Their cost basis will either be the share price on the day of the gift, or your own cost basis, whichever is lower. So if you're giving stocks or bonds, choose those with the highest cost basis in your portfolio to minimize heirs' capital gains taxes later on.

If you know that any of your heirs plan to sell the securities and use the money for immediate expenses, it would be wiser to give them cash.

Gary Schatsky, a financial planner in New York, says this is an excellent time to harvest capital losses in your portfolio. He recommends selling securities that have fallen since you purchased them -- claiming those capital losses on your tax returns -- and giving the kids cash this year.

This could also be an opportune time for you to give your heirs real estate, if you have not used up your lifetime, $1 million gift-tax exclusion, which applies to gifts above the annual limits. Couples can give $2 million during their lifetimes, without incurring gift taxes. Suffice it to say that a lot of attractive properties have fallen below $1 million or $2 million over the past couple of years.

Although giving your children the second home might seem like a no-brainer in this market, there is a catch. If you plan to continue using the home after you give it to your heirs, then you would have to start paying them rent. Otherwise, the Internal Revenue Service won't consider it a gift.

Douglas Rothermich, a vice president for estate-planning and trust-consulting for TIAA-CREF, says one way to avoid this pitfall is to give each child a stake in the vacation home. That means putting the house into a trust or partnership and giving each child shares. So long as the couple retains a stake for themselves, they may be able to qualify for the gift-tax exclusion without paying rent.

For this arrangement to work harmoniously, Rothermich says, the family should decide in advance how the property will be shared. ""In a lot of wealthy families, they don't end up fighting over the big dollars, but who gets to use the family compound on which weekend,"" he says.

If you're awash in beaten-down stocks, consider stashing some of them in a grantor-retained annuity trust, better known as a GRAT. That gets the assets out of your estate, but you and your heirs still profit from any recovery. How? You get an annuity stream from the trust, and the heirs get any returns in excess of a predetermined annual interest rate -- now a low 3.4%. Typically, GRATs are set up for no more than five years, because if the grantor dies during the term of the trust then the assets revert to his estate.

""The call you're making is that you think the market is going to recover over the next three to five years,"" says Beth Rodriguez, a wealth adviser in the Chicago office of JPMorgan Private Bank. And you don't have to be Pollyana to believe in a recovery like that.

In the pages of the Chronicle of Philanthropy, the bible of the giving industry, nonprofit leaders and scholars assailed the study as shallow, sloppy, illogical and sensationalistic. In perhaps the most stinging attack, Lester Salamon of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Policy Studies zeroed in on McKinsey's role as an advisor to Enron. ""Having Enron-ed the corporate world, let's make sure the management consultants are not set loose without proper preparation to Enron America's charities as well,"" he wrote.  

But for all the uproar, Bradley and McKinsey are on to something. With money tight -- charitable giving has been flat or down for the past two years -- it's unquestionably a good time for charities to make sure donors are getting the biggest bang for the buck. Exactly how much in savings can be wrung out of the nonprofit sector is a tricky question; like much else in the realm of giving, there's more art than science to sizing up efficiency. But Bradley's number, that $100 billion-plus, may not be far off the mark.  

""I think he's probably right,"" says Eli Broad, retired chief executive of financial giant SunAmerica and a leading philanthropist. ""There are big savings out there.""  

Bradley is the first to admit he may not be exactly right. ""Even if [the total] is off by a third, it's still an enormous number, double annual foundation giving,"" he tells Barron's. The nation's nearly 62,000 foundations gave $30.3 billion last year, representing about 12% of total giving. The point, Bradley says, is this: ""Donors must rethink the way they provide resources and nonprofits must reengineer the way they use funds.""  

Indeed, that is already starting to happen. Donors big and small are paying increasingly close attention to how charities operate -- and actively cajoling them to improve. They are devising a range of new giving strategies -- such as structured grants that allow funds to be released only on evidence of accomplishment and zero-interest loans to finance capacity growth -- and they are tracking the results doggedly. In short, donors are applying a solid dose of tough love.  

And if the charities don't respond? ""We have no problem discontinuing grants to organizations that aren't meeting their goals,"" says Broad, who lately has been focusing his philanthropy on public education.  

Crunch Time  

It isn't surprising that efficiency is coming to the fore right now. Amid government spending cuts, charitable organizations, whether helping the homeless or promoting the arts, are being asked to do more than ever. At the same time, the weak economy of the past few years has taken a toll on income. Total giving to the nation's 400 largest charitable groups fell an inflation-adjusted 1.2% in 2002, to $46.9 billion, after several years of double-digit growth, the Chronicle of Philanthropy recently reported. Despite a pickup over the past month along with the economy, total giving for 2003 is likely to be no better than flat, experts say.  

Everyone, donor and charity alike, is struggling to make the most of available dollars. The push for more efficiency comes especially hard from the new generation of philanthropists, whose fortunes resulted from entrepreneurship rather than inheritance. ""They are used to hiring people, setting expectations for them and measuring the results,"" says Steve Bell, head of wealth management at Northern Trust in Chicago.  

At this time of year in the past, many people freely doled out contributions to their favorite charities, no questions asked. Today's donors are checking their lists twice before playing Santa. They want to make sure they earn a ""social return"" -- in the form of productive work by the charity.  

""More and more people are seeing their charitable donations as investments,"" says David Ratcliffe, director of the Merrill Lynch Center for Philanthropy and Nonprofit Management in Hopewell, N.J.  

He points to the Meredith Family Foundation's $100,000 grant to the Nature Conservancy of Montana as a case in point. Thomas Meredith, the retired chief financial officer of Dell Computer, and his family donated $100,000 toward hiring three managers for two years on the condition that the nonprofit raise $300,000 in matching grants and make demonstrable progress in protecting nearly 90,000 acres in the Blackfoot River Valley.  

By the end of the period, the managers had better be generating enough in new funds to justify their own salaries -- because the grant won't be covering them anymore. Jaime Williams, the nonprofit's Montana director, also must make a significant dent in raising the rest of the $10 million to $12 million he reckons he needs to get the job done.  

Big-Sky Progress  

One year into the project, Williams has raised the matching grants. He also has attracted $5 million in public funds and another $1.8 million of private-capital contributions. He says he has protected 15,000 acres by placing them in permanent conservation easements, and signed a four-year contract with a timber company to buy a further 89,000 acres.  

The Meredith grant ""gave us the confidence to expand in strategic ways during an economic downturn,"" Williams says. ""I think the best result of this investment will be that we have the organizational experience to take on future projects of this scale and complexity.""  

The trend toward increased donor activism could help a range of charities. ""It is a way to improve the efficiency of the charities by incorporating many of the ideas that have allowed great productivity improvements in industry over the last couple of decades,"" says Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel and a major supporter of environmental causes, higher education and science.  

The movement also promises some protection from scandal. Donors have been jolted by a series of scandals at charitable organizations, including reports of deceptive accounting and embezzlement by units of the United Way and some Sept. 11 funds. As on Wall Street and at corporations, vigilance can be the best defense.  

At a minimum, experts say, donors should make sure charities are providing clear measurements of the outcome of their work. How many hungry people were fed? How much land was protected? Did the students get better grades?  

""If the outcome cannot be measured, how does the donor know that he made a difference?"" Moore asks.  

Peter Karoff, founder and president of the Philanthropic Initiative, a Boston-based advisory, helped one donor establish a results-based program in that city's public middle schools. The program rewarded outstanding math and science teachers with $3,000 each to spend in their classrooms. The awards were based on test scores, student evaluations of teachers and other measures such as whether students continued to pursue the subjects in high school.  

The donor and his advisors were able to modify and expand the program each year for eight years, when the city's school department began picking up the expenses -- a home run for any philanthropist. Karoff is working now on a similar, but much larger, grant by another donor to the New Jersey school system.  

""As a donor,"" says Karoff, ""you are helping when you say, `If you show me results, I'll give you more and you can spend it on what you need.'""  

In sizing up a charity's performance, a good start is to examine how much of the money raised is actually spent on programs, rather than fund-raising or administrative costs. At least 75% should go to programs, many experts say. Take a hard look at fund-raising costs, too.  

The table on page 26 -- highlighting four efficient charities and four that could stand some improvement -- is based largely on those two measures. There's quite a range, for instance, between the 5.2% of total income that it costs the Salvation Army to raise funds and the 26.3% it costs the Disabled American Veterans. Why? The veterans group relies on direct mail and telemarketing -- two pricey forms of fund-raising -- and says it has had difficulty attracting corporate or foundation grants.  

It's possible, of course, to get carried away with applying business metrics to charity. If philanthropists shunned all seemingly inefficient charities, some organizations serving vital community functions might be put out of business. Efficiency isn't the only measure of a charity's performance.  

Difficult Questions  

Take the Humane Society. Who is to say how many people treated animals better after getting information from the society, even if they didn't donate any money? The Humane Society, however, lags behind based solely on financial-efficiency measures.  

""Charities need to be more businesslike, that's true,"" says Claudia Sangster, director of philanthropy services at Harris MyCFO, a private banking concern in Los Angeles. ""But it isn't the be-all and end-all. They aren't corporations.""  

That tension -- how much like a business can a charity be? -- was underscored by the furor over the Bradley report, first published in May in the Harvard Business Review.  

(MORE)  

For instance, Bradley and co-authors Paul Jansen and Les Silverman of McKinsey suggested the nonprofit sector's fund-raising costs, which they pegged as 18% of money raised, should be closer to private industry's cost of raising capital (2% to 5%) and total sales and marketing costs (often about 10%). This change alone would save $25 billion, the authors said.  

The rebuttal: Charities may be more similar to small businesses than to big business, and small businesses run up marketing expenses closer to 20%. And, while the study suggested charities streamline fund-raising by pursuing fewer but larger donations, critics say this could concentrate too much power with big donors and hurt charities lacking access to them.  

Bradley and McKinsey's single biggest savings -- $55 billion -- would come from reducing service costs. The study points out that ""costs per client"" vary as much as 67% among local affiliates of one national youth organization, suggesting that some of the affiliates could cut costs significantly. Critics say such ""cost per client"" analysis, while perhaps appropriate for evaluating mass production, fails to account for the needs of different types of people served by charities in different locations.  

The rest of the study's savings would come from trimming administrative costs and distributing money to charities' causes faster. Faster payouts, the study says, usually create more value.  

As donors wade into these issues, one of the first problems they face is a paucity of detailed information about nonprofits. That's a problem for all donors, from those who have millions and occasionally billions to invest in social change to the thousands of Americans who will donate, on average, 2% of their annual income this season.  

Right now, the source of most information in the sector is the IRS 990 annual tax-return form, along with often-patchy annual reports. But, Bradley says, the 990 form doesn't have enough details.""When you find 2,200 organization that claim to have raised funds without spending a dime, something is clearly wrong,"" he says. That's why he is calling for the creation of a new institution to measure and publicize nonprofit performance, something along the lines of the Morningstar rating service for mutual funds.  

For now, would-be donors who want to understand where their dollars will be going may have to do some sleuthing. Consult charitable rating services, such as the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Guide (give.org), Guidestar (guidestar.org) and the American Institute of Philanthropy (charitywatch.org). None are as comprehensive as the service Bradley has in mind, but taken together, they're a good start. And by all means, ask the charities themselves for information: descriptions of program activities, recent accomplishments, financial statements and names of other donors.  

Once you pick a good charity, try pushing it to be even better. Even small donors have more influence than they may realize. Says Sangster at Harris MyCFO, ""You'll be surprised at how much a charity will do to please donors, especially those who give consistently.""

At least they weren't surprising to those who have been warning about the character (low-quality leadership) and magnitude of the six-month rally. The skeptics have warned that technology stocks were pricing in excessive expectations for imminent profit growth, and that higher interest rates would pinch the housing economy and hurt financial stocks, a huge sector whose strength is crucial for the overall market.  

A profit outlook from Texas Instruments that appeared to confirm market expectations for the current quarter apparently was not good enough for newly demanding tech-stock holders. Texas Instruments' shares, which rose 10 points, to 26, from March 11 through Monday, fell to 23.88 on the week. Semiconductor shares, which have led the market as investors bet on the revival in cyclical computing demand, were dragged down 4% from Monday's close, though the Nasdaq Composite dipped by only 3 points, to 1855.  

Financial shares, meanwhile, eased after several companies, including Washington Mutual, Countrywide Credit and National City, warned that mortgage demand was ebbing. Banks stocks were dinged and fell 1.5%, versus a two-point drop in the Standard & Poor's 500, which closed the week at 1018. The Dow Jones Industrials slid 31 points on the week to 9471.  

Yet even with such setbacks, stocks maintained their months-long knack for holding sharp selloffs to a single session. Witness Friday's transmutation of morning losses into closing gains, despite disappointing news on retail sales, which followed Thursday's soft data on unemployment claims.  

As the week began, the S&P 500 finally punched through the upper bounds of its recent trading range, reaching a 52-week high of 1031 before the news from Texas Instruments and the mortgage concerns pulled shares back.  

The rise above 1020 scared off plenty of short sellers, and emboldened some momentum investors. Yet this run-up, coupled with a modest retreat through most of the rest of the week, fueled arguments on both sides of an increasingly lively debate about whether the year's rally can continue, or is overdue to expire.  

The bears call the rally an engineered product of enormous liquidity generated by the Federal Reserve and the government, which has punished risk-aversion and exercised the old speculative muscle developed in the bubble days. Short-covering and performance-chasing by professional investors have exacerbated the move and fostered a complacency about stock prices, the skeptics say. Corporate insiders have hit the public's bid by dumping stock, and profit forecasts will likely prove too optimistic for the fourth straight year. In other words, stocks are anything but cheap.  

In broader terms, this camp sees a slow-growth, capacity-choked, job-destroying post-bubble economy that has been treated with an extra dose of leverage. This leverage has lifted already high levels of corporate, consumer and government debt to alarming heights.  

The latest commentary by the influential Bill Gross at Pimco is a representative lament. He describes an American empire in decline and in denial, as it pursues a debt-financed policy of domestic over-consumption and geopolitical over-reaching. Hummers at home and Humvees abroad. As a result, foreign creditors are in charge of the country's destiny.  

Notably, the bullish case begins the same way, with irresistible liquidity, unstoppable economic stimulus and comfortably easy comparisons against the underachieving economy of a year ago. But the optimists believe these forces are approximating a normal cyclical recovery that will segue into sustainable growth.  

Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management, thinks this recovery looks normal considering that fiscal policy and the stimulus of dollar weakness only joined the Fed's pump-priming in the middle of 2002. Given typical lag times, the recovery has begun on schedule.  

Paulsen believes the market incongruously got a break with Sept. 3's disappointing report about August employment. It lent a bid to the Treasury market and began pulling bond yields down again.  

A steady rise in interest rates since early June had stifled the stock market, and for now that pressure has lifted. In fact, Friday's softer economic numbers continued this process, as the 10-year Treasury yield sank to 4.27% from 4.6% ten days earlier. Paulsen is confident there will be a strongly positive employment report at some point in the coming months, which will spark a nasty retreat in bonds. But for stocks, it would be better if that happened with rates at 4.2% rather than 4.7%.  

Paulsen also figures corporate profit margins, now at 1989 levels, have room to rise and thereby help support stock prices into next year. That means ""we can replay the 'Nineties to some degree."" he says.  


   Specifically, he expects 2004 to be much like 1994, when a lagging recovery gained speed, the Fed was forced to boost rates and stocks handily beat bonds. At some point in the coming months, Paulsen figures it will be time to stop betting on hard-core cyclical stocks and start buying   shares in more stable industries.   

Vadim Zlotnikov, strategist at Sanford C. Bernstein, says, ""In order to make a bet at these valuations on anything strongly pro-cyclical -- like tech, small caps and industrials -- you have to feel that we'll not only get a recovery but it will be a very robust one."" And the only way for that to occur is for reflation to take hold, which depends on the dollar weakening, he says.  

Although there soon will be reasons to look for a shift in leadership, current trends favor cyclical and small stocks. And portfolio managers might chase them higher still as the third quarter and the year come to an end.  

John Tesoro, head of equities at Adams Harkness & Hill, a Boston brokerage firm focused on smaller growth stocks, says his clients urgently want to add exposure to stocks. ""They're looking for names that haven't moved yet, second-tier names that will let them get involved,"" he says. Attendance at various conferences focusing on small-caps has been intense as investors scour for fresh ideas. Tesoro figures third-quarter profit reports could give fund managers another excuse to push up these stocks.  

Sentiment, performance anxiety, liquidity and momentum are potent dynamics. They work, even if only until fundamentals validate the optimism -- or don't.  

-- There's still too much capacity in parts of the securities industry. Even after tens of thousands of layoffs, firm revenue per employee is below bull-market levels. Brokerage houses are agonizing over the right structure for expensive research operations. Commercial banks that paid top dollar to buy brokers are considering bailing out.  

None of this is supposed to matter for Goldman Sachs, the most gilded name in investment banking. Its brand and brains make it the envy of most competitors, and add an aura of mystique that confers advantages in hiring and client-acquistion. But when it comes to Goldman's stock, what price greatness?  

The shares, which never got as cheap as most other brokerage stocks through the bear market, have gained more than 40% since the market's lows in March, and now trade for more than 17 times expected 2004 profits. That's about 90% of the market multiple, versus an average 75% historically, says Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Strauss.  

The firm's return on equity has lagged its peers. It continues to compensate workers far better than other firms, and there are signs it has moved further out on the risk curve to chase returns amid the prolonged slump in merger-advisory or underwriting business.  

Strauss, who until this year worked at Goldman following the brokerage stocks (excluding Goldman, of course), last week formally began coverage of the firm with a report stating that the stock is fully valued.  

Goldman increasingly has turned its emphasis toward trading, especially fixed-income trading, to seek returns, and in doing so seems to be taking on more market risk. Strauss notes that a mainstream measure of trading exposure, called Value at Risk, shows Goldman's risk tolerance has doubled since 2000 and VaR as a percentage of its tangible equity is more than twice that of its competitors.  

Much of this risk involves taking positions in its bond-trading book, which benefits from the current steep gap between short- and long-term interest rates. The temptation to feast on that spread means that any boost in short rates by the Fed, perhaps early next year, could resemble the nasty bond-trading environment of 1994. Yes, Goldman's risk managers know the history, too. And investors ought to keep it in mind in debating whether to take profits.  

Investors presumably bought Goldman stock not to play the yield curve, but because an expected jump in merger and stock-offering work would yield outsized benefits to the firm. Trading, of course, has become a much larger proportion of Goldman's business precisely because the high-margin banking fees of a few years ago have dwindled.  

Sanford C. Bernstein's Zlotnikov likes Goldman as a financial-sector play because it will reap ample gain from what he expects will be a brisk merger environment in 2004. That is exactly the bet a buyer of the stock at today's prices needs to make -- with great confidence that investment bankers will begin acting as rainmakers rather than as overhead, and much sooner than the consensus now believes.  

(MORE)  

-- Like all good analysts, the folks who follow metals stocks busy themselves handicapping the supply and demand for the underlying commodity, which leads to metal-price forecasts and down the line to profit and stock-price estimates.  

This works pretty well when toting up the known consumers of industrial metals, set against the expected supply from mines. But when it comes to gold, this approach isn't as useful. The potential buyers of the metal aren't knowable at any given time, because in addition to industrial users and jewelry fabricators, they include people who view the metal as something akin to money.  

That's why the latest run in gold prices to $380 per ounce, and the jump in gold stocks, have largely been missed by Wall Street analysts who cover the industry.  

Shares of Newmont Mining, the largest U.S. producer with the biggest stock-market capitalization, are up more than 30% this year to around 40, and have tripled since late 2000. Newmont is viewed as a pure equity proxy for gold prices, and is among the few stocks large enough for institutions to play. But its huge rise has not been accompanied by much enthusiasm from the sell side.  

Newmont is rated Hold or Sell by 15 analysts, while 10 have a Buy rating on the stock, a ratio that passes for a loud ""Nay"" vote on Wall Street. Tellingly, the median share-price forecast on Newmont is around 35, 12% below the current quote. Credit Suisse First Boston analyst David Gagliano is somewhat typical of this group. Last week he nudged his gold-price forecast to $353 from $346, but continues to think the commodity will trend lower in coming years.  

There's a fair amount of puzzlement surrounding the powerful performance of bullion, especially among those who figure that gold can only thrive when inflation is high or investors are fleeing risky financial assets. But most of the macro arguments focus on the metal's status as the anti-dollar, or the anti-paper currency. With the Federal Reserve seeking to reflate the economy, a weaker dollar is a must given the scant room for much lower interest rates.  

Meanwhile, America's trading partners are fighting to keep their currencies weaker against the dollar. The default beneficiary is gold, notwithstanding slurs that it's an anachronism, the object of nostalgia for its historical status as a store of value.  

John Roque, technical strategist at Natexis Bleichroeder, has been bullish on gold for some time, and sees evidence of forceful buying in the charts. Since late 2000, he notes, Newmont has risen from 13 to 40. That's only about half the move the stock made in another period of dollar weakness from 1984-'87, when it rose to 82 from 12.

But when the wind changes, beware the blowback.  

There's no weathervane accurate enough to say whether investors' incautious embrace of risk this year is about to confront a harsh headwind. What is clear is that stocks lately have had to withstand adverse forces pressuring some of the market's leaders. So far, the generals have withstood the assault.

",",c13,e1202,gcat,ghea,gpersf,gpol,gvhhs,gwelf,nedi,ccat,e12,ecat,gvbod,gvexe,ncat,",,1081550622000,"Even if they have saved some money, and if they have some kind of defined-contribution plan at work with an impressive balance, and if they have equity built up in their homes, it's probably not enough to finance the retirement they imagine. Half of all American families had less than $25,000 in financial assets in 2001. Including home equity and other assets only pushed the median value of assets up to $147,000.  


   In the half with assets of more than $147,000, it's still likely they don't have a disciplined retirement plan with specific financial goals. Few have an investment strategy that can carry them to age 100, delivering their target after-tax retirement income adjusted for future inflation, minimizing risk and leaving their principal intact as a bequest to their heirs.      

There's a good reason why they don't have the needed discipline: If they figured the cost of 35 years of retirement protected against inflation, they would drop dead now and save themselves a lot of worry.  

(Why 35 years, if average life expectancy at age 65 is less than 20 years? Even in Las Vegas, there are lots of people who beat the averages. It would be a shame to win at the game of life and lose at the game of paying for it. It would recall Tithonus, the pathetic figure in Greek mythology who successfully wished for long life, but forgot to ask Zeus for eternal youth.)  

In the most recent Survey of Consumer Finances, the Federal Reserve found that Tithonus has many present-day equivalents. Even among the American families in the top 10% of income in 2001, for whom family income averaged more than $300,000, average family financial assets totaled about $2.25 million. Half of these top-earning families had a net financial worth of less than $834,000.  

While these wealth statistics might prompt nothing but envy from the other 90%, even the wealth of the top 10% isn't enough to ensure glorious retirement.  

Consider the nearly risk-free path of retirement investment, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. Lay up enough of this paper in your nest egg and you will bear only a few remaining risks, such as the rate of income taxes you will pay when you receive your interest and additional principal, the possibility of a shortfall between the government's inflation index and your real cost of living and, of course, the possibility that the U.S. Congress will find it inconvenient to live up to its bonded promises.  

TIPs are paying about 2% taxable, plus the inflation adjustment to the principal, also taxable. Even if such a retirement fund is in a tax-deferred savings plan, you will have to pay taxes on withdrawals. For every $1,000 of annual retirement income you wish to draw from this most risk-averse of investments, you will need to build $50,000 of fund balance, plus 10% to 35% for taxes. That's around $7 million for a risk-free after-tax retirement income of $100,000 a year that also preserves the principal.  

Taking a little more risk starts to look a little more practical. You can find tax-free municipal bonds that pay nearly 5%, although there's some chance that the Alternative Minimum Tax or some other bite yet to be designed will still get you. Say $2.5 million to earn $100,000 a year. Ooops! What about inflation? Inflation that compounds at a mere 2% per year will knock out half the value of your retirement income after 35 years. What's worse: The greater the inflation in any one year, the greater the hit to your real income in every subsequent year.  

Some financial advisers offer a simple rule for retirement income to insure your retirement against inflation: At the start of retirement, take only a third of what your investments earn. Re-invest two-thirds, and it's nearly certain that your rising balance will be able to generate new income fast enough to keep up with inflation. But there we are, back to a needed nest egg of $7 million or more, just to generate $100,000 after inflation, after taxes, from a low-risk portfolio that preserves principal for heirs.  

No wonder people saving for retirement are driven to accepting the risk of fluctuating stock prices, to ignoring the risk of inflation, to forgetting about taxes and to annuities or other fixed-income investment strategies that increase their retirement income by consuming their principal. It's the best they can do.  

For most Americans, in short, a glorious retirement is way out of reach unless:  

-- They play the stock market successfully (which hasn't happened widely as yet).  

-- They strike it rich on rising house prices (which depends on where they live and where they want to live in retirement, and on whether they refinanced themselves back up to the hilt of leverage).  

-- They win the lottery (which is even less likely than the other two possibilities).  

-- They don't retire at all, or go back to work to supplement their savings with salaries (which is most sensible, at least for those who are physically able to carry on working, but not likely: Nearly three-quarters of working Americans are opting to retire at age 62).  

For most Americans, then, retirement is unlikely to be glorious. It is likely to depend more heavily on Social Security and Medicare than on their own resources, since their own resources are quite meager.  

In turn, Social Security and Medicare lean heavily on the working population. Taxes on workers and employers fund Social Security and the hospital insurance Part A of Medicare. General revenues pay most of the cost of Part B medical insurance under Medicare and the new prescription drug plan that starts in 2006; senior citizens pay about 20% of the cost of Part B, usually through a deduction from their Social Security benefits and they are expected to pay about 16% of the cost of the drug benefit.  

But the working people may not be able to bear the load of all the retirees they will be asked to carry.  

Last week, the trustees of Social Security and Medicare issued their annual reports on the fiscal stability of the programs. Social Security is still a long-term mess about which lawmakers continue to be complacent because it is still possible to pay as we go. That is, Social Security taxes on workers and employers still exceed the cost of benefits, with the excess used for other spending. Such diverted spending is known as the Social Security Trust Fund, and the Treasury pays it interest for the money ""borrowed.""  

This politically happy, though fiscally fraudulent, state of affairs in Social Security will last until 2018. The long-term picture of benefits is justly known as Social Insecurity, but there is no movement to fix it, because that would require raising taxes, diverting the Trust Fund into non-government assets and reducing benefits. Someday, probably, but not yet.  

For Medicare Hospital Insurance, however, this year is Someday. Its 2.9% payroll tax, shared by workers and employers, will not generate enough revenue to cover the program's cost. The Treasury will make up the difference, although it will be called interest on the sums laid up in the HI Trust Fund.  

Every year is Someday for the supplemental Medicare programs that pay doctors' bills and other expenses (including some drugs, after 2005). They are funded by charges on beneficiaries and by general funds taxed and borrowed.  

Our retirement income and health programs have been living on borrowed time, and the bill is coming due. Together, Social Security and Medicare taxes are expected to fall $550 billion a year short of covering the programs' expenses in 2018, and the shortfall will keep getting bigger after that.  

We can guess that programs supporting nearly 70 million retirees will not be cut significantly. Their retirement will not be glorious, but Americans will hesitate to make it miserable. Who will pay for them?  

One guess: The rich retirees who think today that Social Security and Medicare are not their problems.

Oscar Schafer, proprietor of O.S.S. Capital Management, just a few blocks uptown, follows with his usual trenchant obser-vations -- about CBS, a Canadian miner and a pair of drug-related issues. He also had some prescient thoughts on Tyco, before the company's recent decision to split.  

Fred Hickey, editor of the High-Tech Strategist in Nashua, N.H., is a balanced sort of guy. And just to prove it, he's got three shorts, all tech-related, and an equal number of longs, including the Canadian dollar, a gold ETF and a computer-networking company with a red-hot China connection.

On page 33 you'll find the full list of this year's participants, most of whom you'll hear from, again, in the pages that follow.(see accompanying illustration -- Barron's Jan. 23, 2006)  

Q: Meryl, your '05 picks all were winners. How about a rerun?  

Witmer: I'll try. The U.S. has neglected its infrastructure. Spending in this area has to increase. Two stocks that could benefit are Chaparral Steel and Walter Industries. Chaparral sells for $30 and has 23 million shares. It was spun out of Texas Industries in July and is the second-largest producer of structural steel in North America. Following a period of consolidation, with high-cost players shutting down, the structural-steel industry in the U.S. is now made up of three low-cost, profit-driven players.  

Nucor [ticker: NUE] has 45% of the market. Chaparral has 30% and Steel Dynamics [STLD] 15%. Imports make up the rest. I have especially high regard for Chaparral's management, led by Tommy Valenta. The three big players have raised base prices and returned margins to appropriate levels, despite overcapacity in the nonresidential construction market. Hurricane Katrina led to increased demand for structural steel, and steel intensity per square foot built is increasing.  

Q: How vulnerable is Chaparral to imports?  

Witmer: The industry has kept its prices at world prices. And steel service centers prefer to buy from a Chaparral or a Nucor, which have short time horizons and pass through the market price. Chaparral is diversifying its product offerings. In addition, it implemented a scrap-surcharge mechanism in January '04. When the cost of scrap goes up $10 per ton, the price of structural steel goes up $10. The outlook is extremely bright.  

Q: What do earnings look like?  

Witmer: This year Chaparral will earn about $4 a share. It should generate another $1.50 in free cash due to the excess of depreciation over capital spending. Looking ahead, the company will pay down its debt. In two years it will generate $6.25 of free cash flow, be debt-free and trade at $50 to $60 a share.  

My next pick, Walter Industries, also will benefit from infrastructure spending. It's a $50 stock, and there are 50 million shares outstanding. Walter is extremely cheap on a sum-of-the-parts basis, and unlike many companies in that position, it has a new CEO who is doing something about it. The company has little Street coverage, always a plus. Walter has two main divisions. Mueller Water Products produces infrastructure and flow-control products for water- and gas-distribution networks and waste-water facilities. Jim Walter Resources has 20 years of proven reserves of high-quality metallurgical coal, or met coal. It also produces natural gas. The company also has a home-building and finance unit, for which it may be best known.  

Mueller, acquired in October from DLJ's leveraged-buyout group, has become a powerhouse in the water-infrastructure market. Walter is planning an IPO [initial public offering] of Mueller, and later will spin off the remaining shares. Mueller is one of the three largest manufacturers of ductile iron pipe, preferred by most municipalities. It also makes valves, hydrants and fittings considered the Cadillac of the industry. The prospects for the business are fantastic for one reason: Water pipe installed in the U.S. over the past 100 years is beginning to fail. A large portion of America's water pipes and valves will need to be replaced in the next 25 years.  

Q: Bad for taxpayers, good for Mueller.  

Witmer: Mueller had pro forma Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization] of about $285 million last year. Assuming 8% growth and $50 million of cost savings, Ebitda could grow to $390 million in 2007, which would equate to after-tax free cash flow of $2.58 a share. This segment is growing, and should sell for 15 to 18 times free cash flow, and trade for $38 to $46 a share.  

Walter's natural-resources segment next year should produce at least seven million tons of high quality met coal and eight billion cubic feet of natural gas. Met coal is an irreplaceable ingredient in the steel-making process. Walter's sulfur content is less than 1%, making it worth $30 a ton more than typical steam coal at today's prices for S02 [sulfur dioxide] emission credits. As world steel markets develop, demand should rise.  

Q: What is the going price?  

Witmer: Walter has contracted all of its coal through June '06 for about $107 a ton. While this price may not be sustained indefinitely, prices will remain firm. Using $70 per ton for coal and $8 per mmBTU for natural gas, we get ""normalized"" earnings of $2.50 a share. Based on current coal and gas prices -- $100 for coal, $10 for gas -- the segment would earn $5.50. Others are trading for about 14 times projected '06 earnings. We value Walter's coal segment at $35 per share, at least. The other segments are worth $2 to $3 a share. In all, Walter Industries should trade for $75 to $85 per share.  

Q: How about another name?  

Witmer: Deckers Outdoor sells for $30 a share. It is a shoe company whose principal brands are UGG, Teva and Simple. UGG makes terrific boots and slippers, typically of shearling. Deckers was one of the most heavily shorted stocks last year because many believed UGG was a fad that would burn out. The naysayers have been proven wrong this season, with inventory at most channels all but sold out.  

Consumers love UGG's spring line. I brought a few pairs, just to show you. [Holds up a shearling moccasin and sandal and passes them around.] These are already beginning to sell out on Websites. The brand could grow from $150 million-plus in current sales to about $400 million within four years. UGG is an ""affordable luxury"" brand, along the lines of Coach [COH], which Abby recommended a few years ago.  

Q: Is Teva a hot seller, too?  

Witmer: It is a well-known sandal brand that has lacked innovation and suffered from competitors taking market share. Deckers' new CEO, Angel Martinez, was one of the masterminds of Teva's best competitor, Keen. Now he's on Deckers' team. We see him rejuvenating Teva and growing sales to at least $100 million within a couple of years from $80 million now. Deckers' third brand, Simple, offers shoes with the comfort of sneakers without the flashy labels. It has generated a following among celebrities, typically a precursor to a brand taking off. Simple sales are only $10 million now, but some think it could be Deckers' biggest brand.  

Martinez began his career at Reebok and built Rockport into a very large brand. He is one of the best, most driven and product-savvy executives in the footwear industry. Deckers could have $500 million to $700 million of sales within four years. Assuming a 16% margin, it could have earnings of $4 to $5.50 a share. Using a P/E of 14, we see the stock rising to $56-$77 a share in a few years. Near-term results should be in the $2 to $2.50 range. You have to be a long-term shareholder.  

Q: What else do you like?  

Witmer: Rolls-Royce -- the airplane-engine company, not the luxury-car company -- has become one of the two main engine players, sharing the field with General Electric [GE]. It has the wonderfully efficient Trent engine and an intelligent management team, led by Sir John Rose. As Rolls-Royce has gained share in the new-engine market, its installed base has grown significantly. The revenue Rolls receives from selling an engine is equivalent to the amount it will receive in aftermarket revenues over the engine's 25 years. Profit on the engine's sale is minimal, but the profit on aftermarket parts and service revenue is a significant and highly predictable annuity stream.  

Rolls is winning 25% to 50% of new-engine competitions. It should win more than 50% as more new planes are introduced with dual-engine options. In contrast, only 10% of aircraft being retired bear the Rolls-Royce name. The company expects its installed base to grow by more than 40% through 2009. To capture the profitable aftermarket business, Rolls has developed Power-by-the-Hour service plans.  

Q: What do they involve?  

Witmer: They tie together sales of new engines and 12-year aftermarket contracts. The airlines love them because their costs are well defined, and they pay by hours flown. Power plans also allow them to eliminate their spare-parts inventories, freeing up capital. Rolls loves the plans because they lock in high-margin business. Currently, 60% of all new engines are sold with these contracts.  

Also, there is little copy-catting of spare parts with Rolls engines, because there is risk of voiding the warranty. Finally, Rolls has moved to reduce the capital intensity of the engine business by teaming with suppliers. As a result, internally funded new-engine development costs have declined by 40%. Over time Rolls will become more profitable, less cyclical, less capital-intensive and worthy of a higher valuation. By 2009 it will generate 35 to 40 pence in EPS [earnings per share]. It will have net cash of 30p and trade for about 17 times earnings, yielding a stock-price target by mid-'08 of 600p to 700p. The stock trades for 440p now.  

Q: That's decent upside.  

Witmer: My last pick is also international. Goodman Fielder is an Australian food company in the milk, yogurt, bread and spreadable-oil businesses. It sells into Australia, New Zealand and some Southeast Asian markets. Friends down under say it's virtually impossible to get through a week without eating or drinking a Goodman product. It also supplies commercial customers. The company has a market share of 30% to 70% in almost all its product categories. It was IPOed in December at A$2 a share by Burns Philp which is controlled by Graeme Hart, famed for his investment track record. Bain Capital reportedly offered Hart what amounts to $2 a share, but he elected to IPO the business in order to keep an interest.  

Q: How large is his stake?  

Witmer: He controls 20%, or $500 million, though he has handed over the reins to a new CEO, Peter Margin, who is a superstar in the Australian food industry. Under Australian law, Goodman is required to publish earnings expectations for the fiscal years ending June 2006 and 2007. It sees earnings driven higher by merger synergies (it recently purchased a dairy company in New Zealand), operational improvements and some topline growth. Goodman thinks it can deliver earnings per share of A18 cents, and after-tax free cash flow of A20 cents per share in the year ending June '08. We think they can do better and deliver A22 cents a share.  

Schafer: Where is the stock priced?  

Witmer: At about A$2.10 a share. Goodman is positioned to do more acquisitions. It intends to pay out 80% of its net income in dividends, so Archie might like this stock. The semi-annual dividend should be at least A5 cents in June and A6 cents thereafter. Goodman currently yields about 5%. We expect the stock to trade for 12 to 13 times free cash at the end of '07. That plus dividends would yield a holder about A$3 a share in two years. The downside seems limited at A$2.10.  

Q: That sounds promising. Oscar?  

Schafer: CBS was spun out of Viacom [VIA] earlier this month. The company has TV, radio, outdoor advertising, amusement parks and publishing. It is the cheapest large media stock, despite terrific assets, potential growth engines and a superior management team led by Les Moonves. Moonves is unique in the media business, as comfortable with the analytical side of the business as the creative side. There is a lot of opportunity to improve profitability. Moonves turned around the CBS network, making it No. 1 in primetime ratings and profitability. Now he'll focus on news.  

CBS' news business has far lower ratings and earns much less than NBC. Sean McManus, who led the resurgences of CBS Sports, is now running the news group. CBS' TV stations have room to expand operating margins by eight to 10 percentage points over the next few years. Moonves also is determined to grow Showtime, which was not a focus of Viacom management and is now part of CBS. Showtime has a third of the profits of HBO, so there's plenty of room for upside. But the greatest opportunity for CBS lies in its ability to extract additional revenue streams from advertisers and other content providers. Moonves believes CBS can get paid a per-subscriber, per-month fee from cable operators to retransmit the CBS signal on their systems. If he is succesful, this revenue stream will be almost pure profit. If CBS gets only 20 to 40 cents per sub, that would translate into $175 million to $350 million per year in incremental profits.  

Q: How likely is this?  

Schafer: Some cable networks should start to pay this year. There are other opportunities to leverage CBS' content, such as video-on-demand and Internet advertising. In March CBS will simultaneously broadcast the NCAA tournament over TV and stream it over the Internet. It will be targeting an entirely different base of advertisers for the Internet. Moonves and his team are competitive and passionate about the business. CBS will earn $1.85 a share in 2006. At less than 8.5 times 2006 Ebitda and 12.5 times after-tax free cash flow, the stock is inexpensive at $27.  

Radio and television are not exactly stable businesses.  

Gabelli: The media pie will grow by 6% to 8% over the next three years, in part because of a tsunami of political advertising in 2008, when we'll have two wild cards running for president. Earnings are going to go up for three years in a row. This is a huge cash generator.  

Schafer: My next pick is Tyco International. The stock is about $29. The company has 2.1 billion shares and $40 billion of sales. It will earn close to $1.90 in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. Investors are missing two things. First is the enormous cash-generating power of the company, which results in free cash flow of 15 to 25 cents more than reported earnings per share. Second is the value of the company's $10 billion health-care business, which earns close to a dollar a share and would be valued near $20 as a stand-alone company. You're paying only 10 times earnings for the remaining businesses.  

When Tyco stock was at $36 last January, there was little incentive to split up the company. But, at 29, there is a serious disconnect between the price and intrinsic value. In November, CEO Ed Breen said that if ""the valuation disconnect persists,"" he was prepared to take additional action besides repurchasing shares. When asked, he said ""the full range of options"" was being considered. One would be a spinoff or IPO or sale of the health-care division.  

Meanwhile, Tyco has reduced net debt from $9.3 billion at the end of September to $6.3 billion now. With $4.5 billion of free cash flow, the company can simultaneously reduce debt, buy back stock and make acquisitions. [Subsequent to the Roundtable, Tyco announced it would split into three separate publicly traded companies specializing in its various business lines. Oscar, who applauded the split, said in a follow-up conversation, ""This split aligns three shareholder constituencies in a tax-efficient manner, and allows each company more flexibility to pursue strategies unique to that business.""]  

Q: Oscar, how about another stock?  

Schafer: My third pick is FNX Mining, a nickel, copper and precious-metals miner in the Sudbury Basin in Ontario, Canada. The Sudbury Basin was formed after a meteorite hit the earth about 1.9 billion years ago, before the Roundtable started.  

Q: You mean, before you got on it.  

Schafer: Just. It has two distinct geological areas: the area of direct impact, or contact zone, and a large fractured area outside this zone called the foot wall. International Nickel and Falconbridge [FAL], the largest producers in Sudbury, have developed the contact zone, but largely ignored the foot wall. It is hypothesized there is a major foot-wall deposit that could be as large and valuable as the contact zone.  

In 2002 FNX acquired noncore properties, as well as some prospective exploration areas, including the right to explore the foot wall behind the Levack contact-zone mine from Inco [N]. It also gained access to Inco's existing infrastructure, to explore for and produce nickel. In February, FNX reported it had found two massive high-grade copper and nickel veins. Geophysical tests indicated the discovery was open in every direction and the resource could be large. It was then we started buying the stock, at about C$7.  

Q: You've done well, we take it.  

Schafer: The stock is now C$13.50. FNX has continued to prove up the discovery. Drilling results indicate there are at least 2.5 million tons of high-grade resources present in the Levack foot-wall zone. The foot wall could hold more than five million tons. FNX properties currently in production or soon to be in production are worth between C$5 and C$6 a share. Assuming 2.5 million to 4.5 million tons are in place, the foot wall should be worth C$9 to C$13. Using conservative commodity prices, and including FNX's C$2 a share in cash and securities, I estimate the value of the company's assets is between C$15 and C$20 a share. At current prices, you're paying nothing for upside potential. In another zone behind the Levack foot wall, the geophysics are also promising.  

FNX bought Aurora Platinum in the third quarter of 2005. Netting out the cash and current market value of the securities acquired, it paid nothing for the Aurora properties. Yet Aurora increased FNX's Sudbury land holdings eightfold.  

Q: Why was Aurora so cheap?  

Schafer: Its management believed FNX was far more likely to achieve exploration success. FNX is currently drilling on the Aurora properties behind Falconbridge. The foot-wall discovery could prove larger than five million tons. Indeed, it is possible the various zones FNX has delineated could be connected, and that the ore body could be three to five times as large as is currently thought. It would mean the foot-wall discovery alone is worth far more than FNX's C$1.1 billion market capitalization.  

Q: For your sake, we hope so.  

Schafer: In June 2003 I recommended Flamel Technologies at $11.65. Since then, there have been several positive developments only partially reflected in the stock at $19.72. A world-class board has been put in place. A new CFO has joined from Aventis. The company is financially stronger and has nearly $4 a share in cash. Its two technologies have completed additional human clinical trials, and the first major product is expected to launch later this year.  

Q: Remind us, what does Flamel do?  

Schafer: It has two ways of modifying drugs. The large pharmaceutical companies' are facing patent expirations on major drugs. Anything they can do to minimize generic competition is money in the bank. One strategy is to modify existing drugs and switch patients to the new formulation, so that when the old drug's patent expires, there are no patients on it. Flamel's most important partnership is with GlaxoSmithKline [GSK], which manufactures Coreg. The drug has sales of $1 billion in the U.S. alone. The patent expires in late 2007, and Glaxo's CEO has predicted the company will launch once-a-day Coreg CR in late 2006, a new formulation that uses Flamel's technology.  

Royalties in this type of arrangement usually are 5% to 10%. We think Flamel will earn close to $2 a share from this partnership. Assuming the company is successful in obtaining R&D milestones to cover its overhead, royalties and potential revenue streams from future partnerships will be all profit. Although the timing is always uncertain in this industry, within two or three years the company will earn $3 to $5 a share and could be two to three times its current price. It will be cash-flow positive.  

Q: Any more picks, Oscar?  

Schafer: Schwarz Pharma has $1 billion in sales and is based in Monheim, Germany. But 78% of its sales are outside Germany. In 1999 the company sold its generic drug business and used the proceeds to fund research and development in neurology and urology. Because of it large R&D expense, close to $4.50 a share, and competition, the company will break even in 2005 and 2006. But it should begin to see the fruits of its research in the next two-three years.  

At 2.8 times enterprise value, the shares sell at the low end of industry valuations. Schwarz's pipeline has three new drugs. The first is Neupro, a once-a-day patch for Parkinson's disease. It has been approved in the European Union, and I hope it will soon be approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  

Black: Is this a dopamine-based drug?  

Schafer: Yes. A patch has a huge advantage over pills, as many patients with Parkinson's have trouble swallowing. Neupro also has an additional indication in restless-leg syndrome. The company's second product, Lacosamide, is an anti-convulsive. Its first indication is for epilepsy, though it can be used to treat diseases such as depression, bipolar disorder and migraine headache. The biggest potential for the product is diabetic neuropathic pain. Recently Pfizer [PFE] launched Lyrica for this pain, and analysts estimate sales of $4 billion in five years. But Lyrica has side effects, including weight gain and in some cases muscle injury. So far, Lacosamide has shown no evidence of either. If its Phase III trial is successful -- the outcome will be reported the second quarter -- the product will be introduced late next year, and could have a billion dollars of sales.  

Q: Does Schwarz trade in the U.S.?  

Schafer: Management said it will consider an ADR [American depositary receipt] when its products become better known in the U.S. Schwarz is reasonably valued at 2.8 times enterprise value to sales. If one of the company's new products is successful, the stock is underpriced. If more than one works, you get the pipeline for free. And, if all five work, the stock will be a home run and the company will earn more than 10 euros and sell at more than 200 euros in the next few years. It sells for 55 euros now.  

Q: Thanks. Fred, want to take over?  

Hickey: Sure. I have three shorts and three longs, just to show I'm a balanced guy. I'll start with the shorts because they are more fun. The first is NetLogic Microsystems, priced around $29. It is a favorite of momentum players, chart gazers and ""get shorty"" types that ran up this and a lot of other tech stocks at the end of the year. The stock is up 60% since October, 140% since it came public in July 2004. The company makes TCAMs, ternary content-addressable memory chips. They go into networking equipment. When NetLogic's products came out they had an early lead, but that is lead is diminishing. This is a commodity product. Cisco [CSCO] accounts for 70% of NetLogic's business. IDTI [Integrated Device Technology], the market leader, has a stronger product and NetLogic is going to lose share.  

Q: How expensive is NetLogic stock?  

Hickey: The P/E on trailing earnings is 39. The P/E for this year's earnings is 30, yet the forecast EPS growth rate is just 12% in 2006. The stock sells for seven times sales and 8.4 times book value. There has been a lot of insider selling -- half a million shares in the past six months. My second short is SanDisk, which Barron's wrote about negatively last year. I think my timing will be a little better.  

Q: Thanks for the compliment.  

Hickey: SanDisk has been tough to short. It's running up on rumors it will have blowout earnings when it reports Jan. 26. The stock was up 152% last year, to 63, and 18% in the first week of January, to 74. It is the world's largest supplier of flash storage cards. It sells primarily NAND flash, used in MP3 players and digital cameras. The stock sells for six times book value, six times sales, 42 times trailing earnings and 32 times '06 estimates.  

If the consumer slows in 2006, the whole industry will be under pressure. Many NAND flash players in Asia, including Samsung, are expanding production. We are seeing a slowdown in the retail flash-card growth rate. Some traders of memory are dumping their flash products now. There is a chance we'll see a blood bath. SanDisk, too, has had insider selling. There were 23 insider sales in the past six months, of nearly a million shares. Also, the company is involved in a number of lawsuits involving threats to its patents. Royalties account for 40% of profits, and that royalty stream might not stay intact. The company lost a recent court case, and the stock got hammered after running up wildly in anticipation.  

Q: What is your third short?  

Hickey: Intel. Some people see it as a value stock. I don't. Intel's profits come from the mature PC [personal computer] market, which has seen three years of double-digit unit growth. This was the replacement cycle. With pricing pressure intense, PC revenue growth has been in the single digits. A slowdown will put the industry in the red.  

Black: Intel sells for around 15 times earnings. Dell [DELL] sells at a higher P/E. If you think the PC business is going to crater, why don't you short Dell as opposed to Intel?  

Hickey: I am short Dell, too. Intel is being beaten badly by AMD [Advanced Micro Devices], a stock I have owned for some years. Even Intel fans know it is going to lag this year, and maybe longer. [Last week Intel reported fourth-quarter results below expectations, and issued a downbeat outlook. AMD, on the other hand, turned profitable and reported a 45% jump in revenues.] Intel still has 80% of the business and used to be able to overwhelm competitors, primarily AMD, when AMD was only a low-end chip maker. Now, AMD has the better products. Dell is the world's largest PC vendor. It is the only Intel-only shop, which is a problem. Dell had a pretty terrible quarter and may be forced to consider using AMD chips. It would be a terrible blow for Intel if Dell announced a switch. Michael Dell made some interesting comments at the Consumer Electronics Show, alluding to the use of AMD chips. It was the company's strongest wording yet. Intel is expanding capacity, as is AMD. Even if there isn't a slowdown, there could be a 20%-25% oversupply of processors.  

Black: What is your estimate for server growth? That drives demand for Intel, too.  

Hickey: Competition from AMD is pressing Intel on the server side. Server revenue growth isn't all that great.  

Gross: Isn't China the ultimate producer? Hickey: China has its own chips, but they are low-end. AMD is hitting Intel in high-margin servers and notebooks. Interestingly, AMD is making moves to license its technology to the Chinese and to India. It may develop a joint facility with a company called SemIndia. It is looking to Asia for potential help in manufacturing. This market has been controlled by Intel for a long, long time, which is why Intel's gross margins are so high. Slowly but surely, AMD is becoming a threat. Intel's market cap is $160 billion. It sells for four times sales. For many years, in the mid-'Eighties to 'Nineties, it sold nearer to two times sales. Now it's pretty pricey.  

Q: Tell us about your longs.  

Hickey: I'm buying streetTRACKS Gold Shares ETF. It sells for one-tenth the price of gold. It's very liquid. Expenses are low. You don't have to store the gold; they store it in London for you. HSBC is the custodian. I expect the dollar to decline for a lot of reasons: The repatriation flow is ending [companies received tax breaks last year on profits earned overseas]. Bernanke replacing Greenspan at the Fed. The record trade deficit, $69 billion in October. The end of interest-rate hikes. The large budget deficits during an economic recovery. The government asking to raise the debt ceiling again.  

The Indians, Chinese and Middle Easterners have an affinity for gold, and wealth is moving in their direction. Gold production is falling, particularly in South Africa. There has been a long period of underinvestment in gold[?]. Also, I'm leery about mining stocks. Some mines are located in South America, where there is a leftist tilt and talk of confiscation or the renegotiation of contracts. It would be great for gold. It might not be so good for mining companies. People in Russia, Argentina, South Africa and China are talking about diversifying their reserve base. In many cases they are talking about increasing their gold positions. For all those reasons, I like GLD as well as the metal.  

Q: Do you have a price for gold?  

Hickey: It depends what happens to the economy and what Mr. Bernanke does as a result. It also depends on the dollar. At $500-plus an ounce, gold doesn't look high relative to what it traditionally is valued against, whether that be oil or the Dow.  

Zulauf: Last year was the first year in a long time in which gold went up against virtually all currencies. It went up despite the fact that the dollar also went up against most other major currencies.  

Hickey: My next pick is a way to protect against the decline of the dollar. You can own all the major currencies and do better than the U.S. dollar in 2006. Sometimes it's hard for people in the U.S. to buy Asian currencies, so I'm recommending the Canadian dollar through ownership of short-term government bonds. There's a two-year that yields 3.75%. You get interest plus the currency swing. The Canadian dollar has been strong for four years against the dollar. Canada has had eight consecutive annual budget surpluses. Debt as a percentage of GDP has fallen from 68% in 1996 to 38%. That's more progress than any other G7 country. Canada has a resource-based economy, which is more likely than the U.S. to hold up in a slowdown. The Chinese are very interested in Canadian assets. Canada runs massive trade surpluses, nearly $50 billion in 2004 and 2005. The Canadian dollar used to sell at parity with the U.S. dollar. It will again soon.  

Gross: One negative is the North American connection, to the extent the U.S. economy goes down, Canada is connected.  

Zulauf: It crushes all their industries outside of natural resources. Canada's main trading partner is the U.S.[?]  

Hickey: They will do better than we will. Those resources will hold up better than the things our economy is based on.  

My last long is a tech name. It's pretty hard these days to find value stocks in tech. 3Com is a highly speculative long, a turnaround story. The company has lost out to networking-industry gorilla Cisco in recent years. It was as high as $25 a share in 2000, and it's now $4. Revenues have stabilized after declining for some time. The company has had four consecutive quarters of sequential revenue growth. The last was 22%, year over year. Again, they make routers and switches, just as Cisco does. They have a strong Voice-over-Internet Protocol [VoIP] product line, which is a hot category. They sell security products, due to the recent acquisition of TippingPoint. Their connectivity-product line has depressed overall results, and is nearly gone. 3Com has a $1.56 billion market cap, and $754 million in cash. The enterprise value is around $800 million, or about one times sales. The company burned through $28 million of cash in the latest quarter, but that's been improving. At this price it is intriguing, especially when you consider the hidden jewel.  

Q: The hidden jewel?  

Hickey: A few years ago 3Com set up a joint venture with Huawei, the largest networking company in China. Huawei-3Com is growing rapidly, and it's causing Cisco great grief. Cisco talks about the Chinese threat in every conference call. The joint venture has grown to a run rate of $500 million in sales, based on the last quarter and the current one. It has had four sequential quarters of double-digit revenue growth. There are 3,400 employees at this joint venture. Half are Chinese engineers, at an estimated cost of one-fifth of 3Com's engineering talent in the U.S. 3Com owns 49% of the company, with an option to buy another 2%. That option has just come up, and Huawei has approved it. If 3Com buys it, it gains controlling interest. It is awaiting approval by the local Chinese authorities as well as Beijing. Once it buys the 2%, all these fast-growing revenues start showing up on its P&L [profit and loss statement].  

Q: Is the joint venture profitable?  

Hickey: It's near breakeven, and in the current quarter 3Com expects it to be profitable. It has an estimated 20% share of the networking market in China. 3Com can leverage the cost savings by selling products at significantly lower prices than Cisco. 3Com has the potential to be a massive winner or a bust, but for now there's a lot of cash and no debt.  

Black: Fred, 3Com blew through more than $3 billion of cash at the top of the bubble.  

Hickey: It went from $25 to $4 for a reason.  

Black: They haven't earned a return on capital in this decade. They've got nominal earnings, not enough to support a $4 stock.  

Hickey: It's $2 net of cash, and a play on the Chinese networking market. The joint venture is growing like Topsy. Your risk right now is $2 a share.  

Samberg: Huawei is a world-class company. It's privately held.  

Thanks, Fred. Mario, you've been quiet.  

Gabelli: The domestic consumer will have less resources to spend, due to the energy tax and less mortgage equity. But the global consumer -- Goldman Sachs calls Brazil, Russia, India and China ""BRIC,"" I'll call them ""CRIB"" so Abby won't sue me -- is going to pick up the slack.  

Cohen: BRICS is a Goldman Sachs trademark. You need an S for South Korea in there.  

Gabelli: And CRIB is now a Gabelli trademark. Jobs and wages in the U.S. will increase. Capital spending will be terrific. The economy will be strong in the first half, slowing by the second. Earnings will be OK. Interest rates will come down at the end of the year as Bernanke blinks. The market will be characterized by dividends and deals.  

Now that I've set the stage, my first stock is Skyline. It's $38 a share, and there are 8.4 million shares outstanding. The company has approximately $20 a share in cash. It is in the manufactured-housing business, which is benefiting from the absence of repossessions and a reduction of inventory over four years. The company also is benefiting from industry consolidation. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway [BRKA] has bought several manufactured-housing companies in recent years. Skyline will earn $1.50 a share in the year ending May 2006, and $1.75 next year. They just cleaned out their inventory of travel trailers. The three sisters from Neptune -- Katrina, Rita and Wilma -- helped with that.  

Q: What is your second name?  

Gabelli: It deals with utilities. After Enron, the industry has gone back to basics. It has stable earnings, some growth, rising payout ratios and now, the repeal of PUCHA, the Public Utility Holding Company Act, that takes effect next month. A lot of companies have merged recently, and now, with the removal of PUCHA, there will be more deals. Also, we'll see the removal of the 10% cap on institutional owners of a given stock. You want to buy the companies with unregulated coal and nukes. We own a bunch, but I'll talk about Westar Energy, which trades for $21.50. It's got a $1.9 billion market cap on 86.7 million shares; $1.7 billion of debt and $3.7 billion of enterprise value. We think they'll do $1.60 this year, $1.70-$1.75 next.  

Q: What do they do, Mario?  

Gabelli: This is an electric company, primarily in Kansas. They also have a half-interest in Wolf Creek, a nuclear plant. The balance sheet is in good shape. They get a 4.3% current return, and 85% is excluded from taxable income under this administration.  

My next stock is the subject of this bag. [Holds up a large insulated cooler.] It deals with convenience, wellness, health care. [Removes small yogurt containers from the bag and walks around the table, handing them out.] This is a $50 billion industry around the world. In the U.S. it's only $5 billion.  

Q: Did you bring any spoons?  

Gabelli: The company I like is Groupe Danone. It is introducing in the U.S. a probiotic product popular in Europe. Yes, bacteria can help you. Danone sells for 89 euros. It will report earnings Feb. 15. For the year ending '05, we estimate it will report 12.6 billion euros of revenues, 2.3 billion euros of Ebitda. They dominate the yogurt market globally. They own 20% of a Japanese company in this business. They own Stonyfield Farm. They also have biscuits in France, and a water company that bottles Evian and Volvic. That market doesn't sound interesting, but they are No. 1 in China in water. And 400 million people are drinking water in China that is less than par. Danone has a $25 billion market cap. They'll earn about 4 euros per share for 2006 and are growing about 12% a year. So, think bacteria, and include Danone in your portfolio.  

My next pick is controversial. It's called Flowserve, and our clients have a sizable position [about 4.5 million shares]. The company has a new CEO, Lewis Kling. It has 56 million shares. We have to guess a bit at the numbers, because they haven't issued a 10K or 10Qs for a year and a half. Revenues for 2005 were about $2.6 billion, and Ebitda was about $285 million. On an EPS basis, they will go from $1 to $5 within three-four years. The company makes pumps, valves and flow solutions.  

Gross: Why don't we have numbers for the past year and a half?  

Gabelli: Because of a change in CEOs and some accounting issues, which are being worked out. That's what keeps the stock down. The stock is about $41.50, but you're not buying current earnings. You're buying the earnings power.  

My next company is located in Connecticut. There are 23.9 million shares outstanding. The stock is selling at 20. The company is Kaman. This company has a division, its crown jewel, that will benefit from the growth of commercial aircraft-engine production over the next five years. Boeing [BA] and Airbus will deliver 660 aircraft in '05, and close to 1,000 by 2010. The Kamatics division makes a self-lubricating roller bearing which has a longer life than competitive products. It is a market leader. Second, the company is getting orders from Sikorsky. Another business delivers retrofit helicopters, the SH2G, with orders from Egypt and Australia. They make small helicopters used for lifting logs, but they're phasing it out. They have an industrial-distribution business, and a guitar and music-distribution business.  

Q: In other words, it's a unified company.  

Gabelli: It's no different than General Electric or Tyco. Kaman's market cap is about $450 million. Earnings this year will be about $1.25, and next year, $1.50-$2. They had no vote for shareholders like us until recently. They just bought out the voting stock, and now there's only one class of stock.  

Next, I want to talk about ""some like it hot."" The hot part of an airline engine has to go through multiple repair cycles.There are 12,000 commercial aircraft in the world. There are three companies in the repair business. One is Sequa. It sells for $74. There are 11 million shares and the enterprise value is $1.5 billion. The company's crown jewel is a division called Chromalloy. They are also in the parts-manufacturing-authority business, where they provide repair parts. This is a global company with '05 revenues of $2 billion and earnings of $3.15 a share. We think they go $4.60, $6.30, $8. The chairman, Norman Alexander, just celebrated a birthday that makes him older than Kirk Kerkorian. But I was privileged to see him on the dance floor at 12:30 the other night, and he was going strong.  

Q: What were you doing on the dance floor at 12:30 at night?  

Gabelli: I was going home. Helping the waiters clean up. Let me echo Meryl's endorsement of Rolls-Royce. This is a fabulous five-year play. You've got 1.7 billion shares at 443 pence, <pound sterling>6.6 billion of revenues for '05, <pound sterling>7 billion for '06, and they grow earnings at about 30% over the next three-four years.  

Next, gambling. Hilton Group, in the U.K., has been a favorite of mine, because I thought Barron Hilton and Hilton Hotels CEO Steve Bollenbach, eventually would put Hilton U.K. and Hilton U.S. together. The companies announced that recently. Hilton U.K. is selling all its hotels to Hilton U.S. It will get <pound sterling>3.7 billion and be left with a business, Ladbrokes, the premier gambling establishment in the U.K. Ladbrokes has more online betters than anyone else. The U.K. gambling industry is going through a restructuring. They are going to allow mega-casinos. This company is lined up for that. You buy Hilton Group for 365p today. You get a distribution of about 250p from the sale of the hotels and some leveraging up at Ladbrokes. You wind up creating a company at 119p that will earn 9.9p in 2006 from various forms of gambling. Electronic gaming is growing by 50% a year. It's an intriguing company.  

Q: Is that it, Mario?  

Gabelli: No. Next I want to talk about Ameriprise Financial. Last September American Express [AXP] spun off one share of Ameriprise for every five shares of American Express. Ameriprise has 250 million shares, and had $425 billion of assets under management at the end of September. We all remember IDS. We remember it being called American Express Financial Advisors. Now the company is called Ameriprise, but the mutual-fund brand is RiverSource. It bought a British money manager, Threadneedle Investments, and has 10,000-plus advisors. Is this a money manager or an insurance company? Most analysts on the Street are valuing it as an insurance company. If they start viewing it as a money manager, it will get a significantly higher valuation. GAAP book is $7.8 billion, or about $33 per share. Last year's earnings are probably around $3. Earnings can grow at a high double-digit rate for the next several years. The stock came out at 36, fell to 32 and now trades around 44. The beauty of the business is its inherent cash generation. Very few investors know about the company, in a sense, though we all know about IDS.  

Finally, a word about water, to echo Meryl. Watts Water Technologies trades for 31.50 and ITT Industries is 107, with 90 million shares outstanding. It will earn $8 a share in two-three years, splitting 2-for-1. Watts will have $2.20 in earnings next year, up from $1.90.  

Q: Thanks. Marc, have you eaten your yogurt? Let's talk about your portfolio.  

Faber: I'm glad Fred pointed to the threat to Cisco by 3Com. This is a theme I've been following for the last few years, the huge shift of wealth occurring in the world. Ray Dalio [founder of Bridgewater Associates] recently wrote, ""The current shift in wealth from the U.S. is unprecedented and will go down in history as one of the great financial events."" In this environment, you have to emphasize international investments, largely in Asia. To give you an example, the market cap today of General Motors [GM] is $12 billion, Ford [F] is $15 billion, Honda is $55 billion and Toyota is $172 billion. In 1970, IBM alone had a bigger market cap than the entire Japanese stock market. Over the next 10-20 years Asian markets, including Japan, could have 25% to possibly 50% of the world market cap, from 14% currently.  

Q: How do you capitalize on this?  

Faber: One way is through real estate. In Malaysia, IOI Properties Berhad is a small stock, with a market cap of about $700 million. The P/E is 10 and it yields 6.5%. Singapore has REITs, including Suntec Real Estate. The yield is 5.8% and the market cap is close to $900 million. Another REIT, with properties being redeveloped in a prime location on Orchard Road, is Macquarie MEAG Prime Real Estate Investment Trust, or MMP Prime REIT, for short. It came public at 98 cents Singapore and now trades around S$0.95. It yields about 5.6%. I would also buy a basket of real-estate-related stocks in Thailand, where industrial-park developers buy huge tracts of land and develop the necessary infrastructure. There are two companies in the business. Rojana Industrial Park yields 6.4% and has a P/E of 8. Ticon Industrial has a P/E of 10 and yields 6.4%. I would hedge these stocks by shorting the Philadelphia Housing Sector Index, the HGX, in the U.S.  

Q: There are differing political risks in each of these countries. How will an investor know when to sell?  

Faber: These stocks are to be held for the long term, five-10 years. If you have a diversified basket of companies, in the long run you will do well. Meanwhile, the dividend yield on these investments is higher than the bond yield in the U.S.  

Gabelli: Marc, there is a major intellectual disconnect between what you said at the start of this meeting and the stocks you're recommending now. You talked about a war scenario.  

Faber: Just wait.  

Zulauf: How about real estate in China? Can foreigners buy real estate in China today and be assured of property rights?  

Faber: In the former Communist countries, property rights are improving dramatically because everything that can be stolen has already been stolen. The people who stole it want to have property rights so they can keep it. Property rights are much better than they used to be, but I am not suggesting you buy properties in China now. I'm talking about a prolonged event, a slowdown or recession in China, along with a pandemic and international tensions and war. That leads to my prime recommendation: buy volatility. You can buy VIX [CBOE Volatility Index] futures, or puts and calls on various stocks. I'm not necessarily predicting a war in 2006, but rising commodity prices will lead to a shift in global power and a significant increase in tensions, which will lead to more volatility in financial markets.  

My next recommendation is the Taiwan stock exchange, which you can buy via the iShares MSCI Taiwan Index, the EWT. This index offers a basket of stocks that yield approximately 4%, compared to the Taiwan bond yield of 2%. The Taiwan market hasn't done anything in the last year. Malaysia was down, and I would also buy the EWM, or the iShares MSCI Malaysia Index.  

Zulauf: Why didn't Taiwan move last year? Was there a particular problem?  

Faber: It's all about momentum. When Japan and Korea and India began to move, a lot of money rushed into those markets. As an aside, this is the first time India has become a recognized asset class. It is overbought today, but from a long-term perspective it's an interesting market.  

Next, short the U.S. dollar. It is pegged to asset inflation, namely the U.S. housing market. The Fed will stop tightening when the housing market no longer goes up. Until then, it will be willing to increase interest rates by baby steps. When the housing market and the Dow Jones Industrials decline by 10%, the Fed will flood the system with liquidity. The dollar will become very weak. Some sectors of the global economy, such as PCs and cellular phones, are in oversupply. But the biggest oversupply in the world is the U.S. dollar. It will lose value against hard assets such as gold and silver.  

Q: If the dollar weakens seriously, what will happen to the huge amount of dollars in foreign hands?  

Faber: Once the dollar begins to weaken in earnest, consumer-price inflation will pick up. I doubt foreigners will be enthused about owning fixed-income assets in a currency that is going down.  

Q: Will worries about a run on the dollar prompt the Fed to go slow in lowering rates?  

Faber: That is the view of the optimists. Abby argued this morning that the Fed will be more responsible than it was in the 1970s about printing money. I think it will be less responsible. In 1980, total credit-market debt in the U.S. as a percentage of GDP was 130%. Now it is over 300%. The Fed has much less leeway to let asset prices fall.  

Gross: The Fed has always viewed the currency as a third or a fourth priority. Its first priority is to support the economy, and if the dollar tanks because of that, so be it.  

Faber: In addition to shorting the dollar, I would short 30-year Treasury bonds. In 1980, people were worried about consumer price inflation. No one dreamed the Dow, at the time around 900, would approach 12,000 or so, or that home prices would explode upward. However, consumer-price inflation gave way to asset-price inflation for the next 20-25 years. Now, if you look around the world, everybody believes asset inflation will continue. The Dow will continue going up, and home prices will keep rising. Nobody is concerned about consumer-price inflation. That's why bond yields are so low.  

You're concerned, obviously.  

Faber: The Bank Credit Analyst recently published some interesting figures. From 1960 to 1980, oil prices rose. The yield on the 10-year bond went from 4% to more than 15% in 1981. Thereafter, oil and bond yields fell until 1999, when oil suddenly went through the roof. The subsequent divergence between soaring oil prices and declining bond yields will be corrected massively one day, either by oil prices collapsing or interest rates rising substantially. Both could happen. The second set of figures compares nominal GDP and the 10-year bond yield from 1960 until recently. From 1960 through 1980, nominal GDP was higher than government bond yields. From 1981 until 2001, 10-year yields were higher than GDP. Since then, GDP has been higher again. The point is, consumer-price inflation accelerated from 1960 to 1980. From 1980 to 2001, it decelerated. Now we're looking at higher inflation rates again. So, for the next five-10 years, you need to be short U.S. government bonds.  

In other words, the cycle is turning.  

Faber: For people who are bullish on the U.S., pharmaceutical companies on a relative basis are interesting. Look at a basket containing Merck [MRK], Schering-Plough [SGP] and Pfizer [PFE], all relatively high-yielding stocks. They are particularly attractive if you compare them to European pharmaceutical companies.  

Zulauf: U.S. pharmaceuticals trade at a discount of about 30%.  

Neff: Aren't you concerned about poor product pipelines and legislation against price increases? These are not the growth stocks of yesteryear.  

MacAllaster: They aren't priced the same way, either. There is value here at 12 times earnings and 4% yields.  

Neff: Not unless earnings are going to improve.  

Faber: If their pipelines were highly promising, these stocks would sell for more than they do now. Next, I've got some contrarian plays. About nine months ago I recommended AMR [AMR], the parent of American Airlines, which was difficult for me, given the service I get on American Airlines. But it almost doubled. The entire airline industry is not going to go bankrupt. Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa is a good play on airlines. The traffic between western and eastern Europe is increasing dramatically. Last year the company took over Swiss International Air Lines. In the near term it probably will generate a loss, but over the long run it is an interesting play on consumer travel. It's going to be huge -- out of India and China, and also in domestic markets.  

Gabelli: You can't have a pandemic and travel. You've got to have one or the other. This must be a hedge against pandemics.  

Schafer: Marc, what is the impact, if any, on the big carriers from low-cost airlines like Ryanair?  

Faber: It is huge. Ryanair [RYAAY] now has more traffic than British Airways [BAB]. But low-cost airlines carry one segment of the market. They don't carry you and me when we travel on business. OK, maybe you. Both can survive. In Asia, low-cost airlines have not had a big impact on Singapore Airlines [SPAAF]. But cheap tickets have changed the world. You can fly between Bangkok and Hong Kong for $100, which has led to an enormous increase in traffic.  

Zulauf: The same is true in Europe. Fares on Lufthansa and British Airways have fallen to levels close to where the cheap airlines are. If you want to have a little more comfort, you go with Lufthansa.  

Faber: In Germany, KarstadtQuelle, the nation's largest department store, is a turnaround play. The company has a new CEO, and Germany is healthier economically than statistics would suggest. The German market could continue to perform reasonably well. Karstadt is a play on asset sales.  

Q: Thank you, Marc.

About $11 trillion is predicted to be inherited by baby boomers, and another $4.6 trillion will change hands between 2006 and 2014 through the sale of privately held businesses, mostly by boomers.  

By 2020, when the last of their generation has turned 55, they will own some $30 trillion in assets, and be faced with the challenge of passing them to their heirs without also passing them large tax burdens. The danger: unwittingly letting more money than necessary become fair game for Uncle Sam. ""After spending years accumulating wealth, people don't realize how easily they can decimate their retirement assets simply by not understanding the tax consequences of how they manage their money,"" says Avon, Conn.-based financial planner Michael Reilly.  

As this year's tax-planning season gets under way, folks in their 50s and 60s would do well to start preparing for five key financial events:  

Rolling Out of a 401(k)  

If you hold stock of a company you've been employed at in your 401(k) and you are approaching retirement, consider this little-known tax break: By transferring your company stock into a brokerage account instead of rolling it into an individual retirement account, it can get more favorable tax treatment.  

Typically, money withdrawn from a tax-deferred account is subject to income-tax rates as high as 35%. But under the tax break, you would owe income taxes only on the cost-basis of the shares when they get transferred. The gains -- or the ""net unrealized appreciation"" -- will be taxed at the 15% long-term capital-gains tax rate when you ultimately sell them from your brokerage account.  

Here's how it works. Assume your shares of company stock are now valued at $200,000; they were worth $20,000 when you received them; and you are in the 35% income-tax bracket. Roll the money into an IRA, and your after-tax value would be $130,000. But with the brokerage-account tax break, after paying income tax on the cost-basis and capital-gains taxes on the appreciation, the after-tax value would be $166,000. ""The more gains you have, and the higher your tax bracket is, the more savings you can realize,"" says Mark Cortazzo of Macro Consulting Group in Parsippany, N.J.  

You can generally use this strategy only if you have not taken any distributions from your 401(k) since turning 591/2. In addition, all of your 401(k) assets must be rolled out in the same calendar year. However, you can divide your company stock by rolling some of it into an IRA and the rest into a brokerage account.  

Carlo Croce, 66, of Riverdale, N.J., a retired Pfizer engineer, had about 50% of his 401(k) assets in the drug giant's stock. Most advisers recommend holding no more than 10% of company stock. To diversify without incurring an immediate, large tax burden, Croce rolled some of his Pfizer shares into an IRA, where he could sell them without triggering an immediate tax bill. The rest he transferred into a brokerage account and, on that portion alone, saved himself a six-figure tax bill.  

Receiving an Inheritance  

One of the biggest blunders beneficiaries make: cashing out an inherited IRA rather than preserving it and taking required minimum distributions over their lifetimes. The tax consequences of liquidating are enormous, and you miss the opportunity to get tax-deferred growth on the money.  

Say you inherit a $500,000 IRA at age 50. If you cash it out immediately, you would, at the 35% tax rate, net $325,000 after income taxes. In contrast, if you take annual minimum distributions based on an IRS formula -- starting at $14,619 and getting larger each year -- by age 84, the total amount you will have pocketed will be $2.7 million, assuming an 8% average annual return, says Alan Augulis, an estate planner in Warren Township, N.J.  

There may be another way to maximize inherited IRAs: through an Income in Respect of a Decedent, or IRD, deduction, which can be taken against withdrawals when federal estate taxes have been paid on IRA assets. The value of the deduction is based on the proportion of estate tax attributable to IRA assets. The deduction can also be used against assets in inherited tax-deferred annuities and 401(k)s.  

""People often miss this, because the advisers who deal with the estate and pay the estate taxes are different than the advisers who the beneficiary uses, and no one asks the right questions,"" says Bob Huntley, president of Wise$Counsel, a financial-advisory firm in Georgetown, Texas.  

Linda Crow, 56, the chair of the biology department at Montgomery College in Conroe, Texas, almost missed taking an IRD deduction on her inherited $700,000 IRA, even though she consulted with a tax adviser. ""He never mentioned it, and this isn't something I could have known myself,"" Crow says. Fortunately, a couple of years later another financial adviser spotted the oversight. For Crow, catching the deduction was well worth it. Its value: $117,000.  

Another common error to avoid: pulling assets out of an inherited irrevocable trust. By doing so, the assets become part of your estate. Without further planning, they would be subject to estate taxes upon your death, says Tim Speiss, a tax adviser at accounting firm Eisner in New York. ""You could keep the trust intact and still have access to the funds without invading it.""  

If you are named beneficiary of an estate that you don't want, and your kids are named secondary beneficiaries, consider disclaiming the inheritance. That way, the estate will not be subject to estate taxes twice before it lands in your kids' hands. Keep in mind, however, that you cannot choose who gets the assets if you disclaim them and your kids aren't named. They will be distributed according to the will.  

Creating an Estate Plan  

A basic but often overlooked estate-planning move -- which can save bundles in estate taxes -- is to set up a ""bypass"" trust, which preserves both parents' estate-tax exclusions for the benefit of their children. The exclusion -- $2 million per person for 2007 and scheduled to rise to $3.5 million in 2009 -- is the amount that can be inherited exempt from estate taxes. If you don't set up such a trust, your kids may inherit a total of only $2 million estate-tax free, rather than $4 million. With estate-tax rates as high as 45% on estates worth $2 million and above, that could mean handing the IRS an unnecessary $900,000, says Andrew Pincus, owner of Regal Capital Management, a wealth-advisory firm in East Brunswick, N.J.  

For example, if a husband dies first, his wife would get what's called a spousal rollover of his assets -- meaning his assets go to her free of estate taxes. When she dies, the estate would pass to the kids, who would benefit from her $2 million estate-tax exclusion. But his $2 million exclusion will have been lost.  

A better idea: The husband and wife should each set up a trust to harbor their $2 million exclusion, naming their kids as beneficiaries. If the husband dies first, the wife would be able to access the money, if needed. Assuming she doesn't use it, when she dies, the kids inherit the $2 million in trust estate-tax free, and also get the benefit of the $2 million exclusion on her estate.  

To complete the strategy, however, you must be sure that at least $2 million is titled to each of you -- you and your spouse. ""If everything is jointly owned, you won't capture the exemption of the first person to pass away,"" Pincus says. ""A lot of people lose the exemption because they didn't take two hours to make sure they had assets titled in their own name.""  

And stay current. As the estate-tax exclusion rises, confirm that the language in your estate-planning documents reflect that, and that you have at least that amount titled in your name and your spouse's.  

Another simple way to save big on estate taxes is to create a trust to own your life-insurance policy. If a life-insurance policy is owned by an individual, the benefit would be subject to estate taxes. If it is owned by an irrevocable trust, it will be paid to beneficiaries without an estate-tax bite.  

Don't assume that only those with large estates make large errors. ""One of the costliest and most common mistakes people make, no matter how much money they are passing on, is in their IRA-beneficiary forms,"" says Ed Slott, an accountant and IRA specialist in Rockville Centre, N.Y. Many people assume that if they have a will, their beneficiary form is superfluous. But an IRA's beneficiary form actually overrides a will.  

If you don't name a beneficiary, the IRA will usually go to the estate rather than a person. When an IRA is left to an estate, it must be cashed out soon after death. In contrast, if it is left to a person, that person can take minimum distributions from the IRA and let remaining assets grow tax-deferred for his lifetime.  

Boomers have more wealth and income than any other age group, so no wonder they're the most avid buyers of second homes. In 2005, they accounted for 41% of second-home sales, according to the National Association of Realtors.  

If you're thinking of joining the trend, beware certain tax consequences: Many folks take out a home-equity loan against their primary residence to fund a second home. But consider that only up to $100,000 of a home-equity loan is deductible, says Gibran Nicholas, chairman and CEO of the CMPS (Certified Mortgage Planning Specialist) Institute in Ann Arbor, Mich. If you withdraw more than that, you may get a greater benefit by taking out a mortgage on your second home. All interest on that mortgage would be deductible.  

What's more, if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax, you can't take any deductions for interest on an equity loan. You can, however, claim deductions for mortgage interest. The AMT is a tax system that snares many folks when they have large deductions, and results in a larger tax bill.  

When it comes time to sell your second home, you may qualify to make a so-called 1031 exchange. This allows you to sell a property and buy another without paying any immediate capital-gains taxes on the original property's appreciation. The gain is rolled over to the new property and deferred until a future sale that does not involve a 1031 exchange.  

Only investment properties qualify, ""but that doesn't mean you can't use the property,"" says Stephen Kirkland, a tax adviser in Columbia, S.C. The IRS doesn't specify the number of days that you can use a property and still consider it an investment. ""But if you quantify the return you got on your investment and compare that to the value of your personal use, you can see whichever of those is greater and that may indicate your primary purpose for holding that property,"" Kirkland says.  

If you have a second home you use three weeks each year, and to rent a similar home would cost you $2,000 per week. Then the value of your personal use would be $6,000 a year, Kirkland says; meanwhile, if the home has appreciated $50,000 a year, ""then you can take the position that you have held it as an investment.""  

Selling a Business  

When it comes time to sell your business, you want to get the best deal possible. But if you're selling to management within your company, that doesn't necessarily mean you want the highest valuation possible on your business.  

""The biggest mistake people make is they assume a higher valuation means more dollars in their pockets, but that's not necessarily the case,"" says Loic ""Luke"" LeMener, managing partner of KPLL Private Wealth in Dallas. A lower valuation will mean lower-capital gains taxes for the seller. It will also mean a lower sale price, but other compensation, like consulting income, can be factored in to make up for the lower price tag. There's only so much flexibility you have in lowering your valuation. But there is generally a range, as when analysts value stocks, LeMener says.  

Employee stock-ownership plans also can help. ESOPs let business owners defer taxes on gains from the sale of a company and allow them ""to pay back the people who helped them build their businesses,"" says Deborah Larrison, a managing director at Citigroup Capital Strategies. The plans also can safeguard a company's culture.  

Bill Muirheid, CFO of Hobbico, a distributer of hobby products in Champaign, Ill., says his company was sold using an ESOP, primarily to prevent it from being bought by another company and moved or closed. ""We are one of the 10 or 15 biggest employers in the county. This was for the security of the employees."" While ESOPs account for only about 7% of exit strategies, since 2000 there's been at least a 20% increase in the number of such plans, according to Citigroup and the National Center for Employee Stock Ownership.  

To use an ESOP to sell a business, company stock is bought by a trust, usually with borrowed money. The company contributes to the ESOP each year to repay the loans. The trust shares are allocated to eligible employees, who receive shares or equivalent value when they leave or retire. They can sell them back to the company. The owners can defer taxes on any gains as long as they sell 30% of the company stock to the ESOP and meet other requirements.  

Whatever big financial moves you face, it pays to be prepared for the taxman.

Not from poor investment or budgeting moves; you probably know how to manage those financial affairs pretty well, and you've certainly been reading the right investment magazine. No, we're talking about the danger of paying too much in taxes.  

The tax pitfalls for baby boomers in coming years are likely to be steeper and more numerous than they were for previous generations at the same stage of life, advisers say. That's because the 75 million-plus people born between 1946 and 1964 control an unprecedented amount of money -- some $23 trillion -- and vast amounts of it will be on the move over the next decade or so.

A Schwab One account holder can place international trades through a live broker, and those trades are settled in U.S. dollars. In a Global Account, which is available only to U.S. citizens, you can place the trades yourself online in non-U.S. dollar currencies. By staying in a foreign currency you avoid the conversion fees.

Fidelity (fidelity.com) also expanded its international offerings, adding eight countries and three currencies to the platform it launched three years ago. These new countries and currencies will be available to trade by the end of 2012. Fidelity's international trading capabilities are built into its Web-based trading site and do not require an additional account. The new territories include South Africa, Ireland and Poland, increasing online investors' access to a total of 25 foreign markets and 16 currencies. Fidelity also offers foreign-exchange trading with access to 46 countries and local settlement in 20 currencies.

Fidelity and Schwab (ticker: SCHW) are jumping on a long-term investment trend. The U.S. stock market capitalization now accounts for 47.5% of the world's equity, down 6.5 percentage points from a decade ago, according to MSCI, a global indexing firm. Because of the big domestic rally in the last year and troubles in China and Europe, the U.S. share of global market-cap has regained 4.1% percentage points of global share in the last 12 months. That suggests, however, that it could be a good time to start researching overseas equities for an eventual rebound.

Both firms have added extensive international research tools as well. Anyone with a Fidelity account can access this analysis as well as real-time quotes. Schwab's platform features a stock screener that lets you look for particular countries. Schwab's Equity Ratings, a proprietary method for rating performance, also covers approximately 4,000 stocks in 38 foreign-equity markets.

You'll find plenty of help to get started, or to expand your knowledge once you're comfortable. Fidelity's Learning Center has an international trading video module that steps you through the nuts and bolts of the process. The Fall 2012 issue of Schwab's magazine, On Investing, includes an article by Greg Forsythe, a senior vice president in the firm's equity ratings group, that lays out guidelines for selecting international stocks. Find it at oninvesting.schwab.com.

Trading on international bourses does add risk, especially when you're converting U.S. dollars into a foreign currency. Depending on the dollar's value, it can add or subtract from your return in a significant way. There is also an additional cost; at Schwab, you'll pay 0.2% to 1.0% to convert dollars into other currencies, depending on the amount. Commissions are somewhat higher than what you'd pay to trade U.S. stocks; for example, Schwab will charge 14 Canadian dollars per trade once its commission-free period expires next March, while Fidelity charges C$19. Both firms restrict international trading to non-retirement brokerage accounts.

Most online brokers allow access to ETFs and mutual funds that are invested in international equities and bonds, so there are easy ways to diversify your portfolio without getting into currency conversions and placing trades on international exchanges. But if you're ready to do it yourself, the two largest online brokers have made foreign investing more accessible, and offer plenty of online educational tools to guide you along the way.

While that is better than the broad market's 34% decline, losses of any kind can take the shine out of your golden years.

""Seeing past 12 to 18 months gets very difficult,"" says Jerry Senser, chief executive of Chicago asset manager Institutional Capital. But Senser knows it is essential at least to try, and so do we. This time we've picked 10 stocks that could shine over the next five or 10 years. For the names and numbers, please read on.

Coca-Cola Femsa

At about 26, shares of the world's second-largest Coca-Cola bottler are down nearly 60% from their 52-week high, with investors fretting over the pace of growth at the Mexico-based company.

But David Winters, the savvy portfolio manager of Wintergreen Fund, likes the prospects for Coca-Cola Femsa. ""It is really a play on Latin America, which has been out of favor,"" says Winters. ""But it is a very well-run company, and they are continuing to grow.""

The company remains on solid financial footing, with $650 million of cash as of late February. While earnings were off 70% in the fourth quarter, bulls think double-digit growth could return by the end of 2010, thanks to the company's leadership position in the Latin American market.

The American depositary receipts (ticker: KOF) fetch about 7 times the $3.74 a share analysts expect the company to earn this year -- very reasonable, assuming earnings pick up. ""Right now people think it is never going grow again,"" says Winters.

Microsoft

The shares, at a recent $15.27, have been a big disappointment. Despite attracting many value hunters, the stock has headed ever downward as spending on information technology declines.

That problem masks the company's long-term strength. Wally Weitz, who helms asset manager Weitz &Co., calls Microsoft (MSFT) ""a gigantic cash machine.""

Bill Nygren, co-manager of the Oakmark Fund, notes the company's low price-to-earnings ratio -- less than nine, based on his estimates for this year's earnings -- is closer to seven if you exclude the $4 a share in net cash.

""Investors, especially individual investors, put too much focus on growth expectations and too little focus on price,"" he says.

The stock is also sporting a dividend yield of 3%, slightly more than last week's quote for 10-year Treasury bonds.

ACE Limited

The property-casualty industry may not be glamorous, but it is clearly essential, insuring everything from airplanes to office buildings. ACE Limited (ACE), one of the largest global players in the field, ""is very strong financially, and they have weathered the current environment quite well with a strong balance sheet,"" says Institutional Capital's Senser. What's more, ACE stands to benefit from AIG's woes by gaining market share and raiding its rival for talent.

By Senser's calculation, the stock trades at about 90% of its book value, compared with its historical average of 1.3 times book.

Earnings are apt to be flat this year, but Senser sees high-single-digit growth next year.

Wynn Resorts

Shares of Wynn Resorts (WYNN) are down more than 80% in the past 12 months as the global recession has taken a toll on casino gambling. In the fourth quarter alone, Wynn's revenue fell 14% from a year earlier.

""I continue to believe that people are going to want entertainment, assuming the darkness lifts. And that is our assump- tion -- that the world will go on,"" says Winters. He calls the company's properties, including luxe resorts in Las Vegas and Macau, the best of their kind. The company is run by gaming veteran Steve Wynn, who owns a big chunk of the stock.

Besides the falloff in business, there is concern about the company's debt load, which totaled $4.3 billion, or 73% of total capital, at the end of December. But its cash totaled $1.1 billion, providing some real breathing room.

EMC

A top player in network storage and security, EMC (EMC) has seen its shares lose more than 50% since late 2007. The big worry is softer corporate IT spending.

However, Jeff Coons, co-director of research at Manning &Napier Advisors, says the company is well positioned to take advantage of corporate America's rising need to store and protect data.

""We need more and more storage for our data, and we need more security to protect the information coming in and out"" of those networks, he says. Coons' firm expects revenue from the entire network-storage industry to grow at an 8% to 10% annual clip.

Although EMC is likely to come under more pressure from the recession, its profit outlook seems reasonable right now; analysts expect earnings of 91 cents a share, up from 77 cents in 2008. Even if it falls short of that mark, Coons puts the stock's fair value at about 18, compared with its current price of about 10.

One lingering worry: a recent lawsuit against EMC accusing it of paying kickbacks and overcharging government agencies. But the company denies any wrongdoing, and the suit isn't expected to affect long-term growth prospects.

Cerner

It has been well documented that much of the health-care field isn't at the cutting edge of information technology, particularly when it comes to record-keeping. Fewer than 14% of doctors nationwide use a basic electronic system for record-keeping, says the New England Journal of Medicine. As a result, doctors are prone to more errors.

That is where Cerner (CERN) comes in. It builds and runs data systems, many used to store medical records.

""We look at health-care information technology as a growing trend and really a necessary tool to improve the efficiency and productivity of hospitals,"" says Manning &Napier's Coons.

The market doesn't seem to believe that, with the stock at about 36. But Coons figures the shares are worth $50 or more.

WellPoint

Managed-care stocks have taken a drubbing lately, as investors worry about cuts to Medicare benefits under President Obama's proposed health-care overhaul.

Shares of WellPoint (WLP), the largest Blue Cross Blue Shield managed-care company, have been under pressure for some time. The dismal economy is another factor as more layoffs erode membership in its health-insurance plans.

However, Wally Weitz points out that roughly half of WellPoint's health-insurance business is in administering plans for businesses, rather than taking underwriting risk. Result: Earnings are far more predictable.

He thinks the company will keep growing regardless of what the government may do. ""It's unlikely that the current administration wants the federal government to be the only game in town,"" says Dave Perkins, an analyst at Weitz's firm.

The shares fetch about six times the $5.50 a share Weitz expects the company to earn this year, and he thinks the shares can produce annual returns in the mid-to-high teens for the next few years.

Google

Google, at about $305, has lost more than half of its value since late 2007, as investors have grown wary of its dependence on advertising during a recession. But the fears are overdone. To the extent companies are advertising, they are increasingly doing it on the Net. That trend should continue for some time to come.

Says Coons of Manning &Napier: ""The long-term driver for Google (GOOG) is the push toward online advertising. ""We are going to see more and more ad spending moving in that direction.""

Already, 9.6% of all advertising dollars are spent on the Web, up from 7.6% in 2007, according to eMarketer, a research firm.

Further helping Google: It has absolutely no debt. That is a huge plus in any economy.

eBay

Here is another Internet titan that has been unduly pounded. Investors have been fretting not only about the effects of the economy, but about increasing reports of counterfeit items peddled on the Website.

Those concerns don't worry Bill Nygren of Oakmark, a long-term investor who sees some similarities between Microsoft and eBay (EBAY). Both have big holdings of cash, relatively light needs for cash investment to support growth, and strong brand names, he points out.

He adds that eBay is attacking the counterfeit problem in earnest. ""They are doing everything they possibly can do to minimize that,"" he says. The company's cash position works out to $3 a share, and the share price is just $10, or about seven times this year's estimated earnings. Also, as Nygren notes, the business has ""powerful competitive and scale advantages.""

CVS Caremark

The company runs two businesses: retail pharmacies and pharmacy-benefit management, which helps health-plan sponsors manage their prescription-drug costs.

On the drugstore side, the company widened its footprint last year when it acquired Longs Drug Stores, a big West Coast presence, for $2.9 billion. Senser of Institutional Capital expects the drugstore business to get a boost as more drugs take on generic status, leading to higher retailer margins.

The pharmacy-benefit-management business, for its part, is helped as companies step up efforts to control health-care costs.

Senser thinks the company is capable of generating $3.5 billion of free cash flow, for a cash-flow yield of 8.5% -- ""very, very attractive,"" he says.
