A £1bn pension fund was, perhaps, suddenly facing cash calls of over £100m. Instead of the usual one or two weeks to allow time for orderly sales, they demanded the money in one or two days.

       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'Determined to pursue across-the-board debt cancellation and stymied by repeated failures to achieve that goal through legislation, the Administration resorted to the now-concluded COVID-19 pandemic and a federal law that applies in the context of military operations or national emergencies as its justification for taking this dramatic action.\\n',\n",

       " 'This burden of economic loss will do little to benefit the working class and the poor. The majority of the Mass Debt Cancellation will accrue to the debt borrowers in the top 60 percent of the income distribution. It is fundamentally unfair for those who can least afford it to provide through their tax dollars relief to the well-off who can afford to pay their own loans.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " 'The law that the Biden Administration relies on is known as the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act). But it has never been used to do anything like this before.

The Cancellation instead disregards the Act's objectives and express requirements and distorts the Act beyond recognition in the service of the Administration's political agenda on student loans. It is unlawful and arbitrary agency action, and it should be immediately set aside.\\n\",\n",

These requirements include: requiring the EVs to be manufactured in North America; requiring EV batteries to be made domestically; and mandating that critical minerals used in battery production are only sourced domestically or from nations with whom America has a free trade agreement. Georgia automakers need additional time to meet these new on-shoring requirements and bring planned domestic EV facilities online, including the forthcoming Hyundai EV facility scheduled to open in 2025 in Bryan County, GA.\\n\",\n",

In February, Senator Warnock announced that he secured nearly $20 million in funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build out Georgia\\'s EV infrastructure network across the state. Additionally, Senator Warnock has been in frequent contact with Hyundai about the auto manufacturer\\'s footprint and future in Georgia, and has encouraged efforts on the federal level to bolster the company\\'s presence--as well as EV and EV battery manufacturing, in general--in the state.\\n',\n",

       " 'The gains for women as individuals over the last 50 years have been well documented. The percentage of women with a college degree has increased enormously, from 15% for those born in the 1930s to one third for late boomers, born in the early 1960s (see Figure 1). Higher education has translated into greater labor-force participation and a substantial reduction in the earnings gap between men and women.\\n',\n",

For the earlier cohorts, women's wealth equaled 82% to 85% of men's; for the later cohorts, the comparable figures were 90% to 93%. Boomer men, who did not enjoy gains in education or earnings over time, appear to have been hit much harder than their female counterparts by the Great Recession.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"Table 3 shows how the overall improvement in women's wealth relates to their marital status. The large decline in median wealth for women who spend their lives mostly married largely reflects declining fortunes for their husbands.

       "[\"News Intervention was the right thing to do FINANCE  The Bank of England's extraordinary intervention in the UK Government bond market was absolutely necessary. Despite representing an embarrassing U-turn on its recently announced plans to sell £80bn of gilts into the markets, its emergency purchases helped restore stability to UK financial markets.  The need for temporary giltbuying was catalysed by problems arising in UK pension funds, which hold hundreds of billions of pounds in UK gilts.  Record low gilt yields in recent years meant government bond prices rose sharply, earning pension funds large profits. However, with global inflation and interest rates rising all over the world, bond yields have risen during 2022, resulting in significant capital losses for pension investors. The money received from past profits helped them manage those losses but in recent days the situation dramatically worsened.  The loss of confidence in sterling through September sparked a rushed exit from UK assets, pushing 30-year gilt yields above 4 per cent. The day after International Monetary Fund warnings about the direction of UK economic policy, international investors accelerated sales or shorting of UK gilts, causing yields to crash through 5 per cent.  The sudden collapse in gilt prices led financial companies to demand more cash collateral to cover pension fund losses. A £1bn pension fund was, perhaps, suddenly facing cash calls of over £100m. Instead of the usual one or two weeks to allow time for orderly sales, they demanded the money in one or two days. This created a negative spiral because pension funds had run out of buffers and faced either selling gilts or other assets into the falling markets or risking default.  The Bank of England's remit to protect financial stability, required it to step in and stop the situation spinning out of control, reducing 30-year yields to 4 per cent.  Pension funds have been stabilised but it is important to stress that final-salary scheme members were not going to lose all their pensions. They are protected by the Pension Protection Fund, which insures 80-90 per cent of their promised pension.  Defined contribution pension scheme members, whose pensions depend on their investments, and do not promise a specific pension, may have been more severely affected. These funds often have significant investments in gilts and bonds, supposedly to reduce risk and provide stability, but rising bond yields have caused large losses.

       " 'SIX STATES FILE A CHALLENGE TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION\\'S STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION PROGRAM LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 29 -- The Nebraska attorney general issued the following news release:  Today, six states filed a challenge to the Biden Administration\\'s student loan cancellation program in federal court in Missouri. In it, they ask the Court for an immediate temporary restraining order pausing the program. Prompt relief is being sought because the Biden Administration has indicated it will start cancelling loan balances as early as next week.  Just a few months ago, the Supreme Court warned federal agencies against \"asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted\" by statute. Yet the Biden Administration\\'s recently announced student loan cancellation program-the Mass Debt Cancellation-does precisely that.  Determined to pursue across-the-board debt cancellation and stymied by repeated failures to achieve that goal through legislation, the Administration resorted to the now-concluded COVID-19 pandemic and a federal law that applies in the context of military operations or national emergencies as its justification for taking this dramatic action.  In addition to being economically unwise and inherently unfair, the Biden Administration\\'s Mass Debt Cancellation is another example in a long line of unlawful regulatory actions. No statute permits President Biden to unilaterally relieve millions of individuals from their obligation to pay loans they voluntarily assumed.  This burden of economic loss will do little to benefit the working class and the poor. The majority of the Mass Debt Cancellation will accrue to the debt borrowers in the top 60 percent of the income distribution. It is fundamentally unfair for those who can least afford it to provide through their tax dollars relief to the well-off who can afford to pay their own loans.  The law that the Biden Administration relies on is known as the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act). But it has never been used to do anything like this before. It is inconceivable that when Congress passed the HEROES Act, it thought it was authorizing the President to unilaterally decree something like the Mass Debt Cancellation, which will result in around half a trillion dollars in losses to the federal treasury.  The Mass Debt Cancellation is not remotely tailored to address the effects of the pandemic on federal student loan borrowers, as required by the HEROES Act. The Cancellation instead disregards the Act\\'s objectives and express requirements and distorts the Act beyond recognition in the service of the Administration\\'s political agenda on student loans. It is unlawful and arbitrary agency action, and it should be immediately set aside.  No borrower will be disadvantaged by an immediate court order delaying the loan cancellation program because loan repayments and interest accruals have been paused since March 2020.  States joining in the filing include: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina.

Raphael G. Warnock (D-GA) News Release Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act which would create a phase-in for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act will ensure Georgians may immediately and fully benefit from the cost-cutting and job-creating provisions of the IRA, including tax credits that will lower the costs of electric vehicles.  \"I\\'m focused squarely on helping Georgia car buyers save money and helping car manufacturers who do business in our state thrive. The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Actwill lower costs for Georgians and provide consumers more options when purchasing an electric vehicle, while also supporting good-paying jobs across our state and bolstering Georgia automakers like Hyundai. I\\'m going to do everything I can to get this bill over the finish line,\" said Senator Reverend Warnock.  The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would delay the IRA\\'s phase-in period for automakers to follow specific sourcing requirements for their EVs in order for car buyers to qualify for the federal tax credit. These requirements include: requiring the EVs to be manufactured in North America; requiring EV batteries to be made domestically; and mandating that critical minerals used in battery production are only sourced domestically or from nations with whom America has a free trade agreement. Georgia automakers need additional time to meet these new on-shoring requirements and bring planned domestic EV facilities online, including the forthcoming Hyundai EV facility scheduled to open in 2025 in Bryan County, GA.  Senator Warnock has been a vocal champion for creating green jobs and reducing America\\'s reliance on fossil fuels. Last week, Senator Reverend Warnock pushed the Biden Administration to implement the IRA\\'s EV tax credit provision with \"maximum flexibility\" to ensure Georgia car buyers and manufacturers can fully benefit. In February, Senator Warnock announced that he secured nearly $20 million in funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build out Georgia\\'s EV infrastructure network across the state. Additionally, Senator Warnock has been in frequent contact with Hyundai about the auto manufacturer\\'s footprint and future in Georgia, and has encouraged efforts on the federal level to bolster the company\\'s presence--as well as EV and EV battery manufacturing, in general--in the state.

       " 'Daily 10 Markets Where Sellers Are Cutting Home Prices the Most Sellers reduced their asking prices on roughly one in five U.S. home listings in September, according to data released today. The price cuts come as higher mortgage rates increase the cost of financing a home purchase, weighing on both buyers and sellers.  The share of listings with price reductions in September was 19.5%, according to Realtor.com\\'s housing report-a 2022 high and up from 11% last September. (Barron\\'s and the company that operates Realtor.com are both owned by News Corp.)  Some metropolitan areas in September saw more frequent reductions than others. Of the 50 largest metropolitan areas, the share of listings with price cuts was greatest in Phoenix; Austin; Las Vegas; Denver; Sacramento, Calif.; Dallas; Tampa, Fla.; Nashville, Tenn.; Portland, Ore.; and Jacksonville, Fla. The share of listings with price reductions in these markets ranged from 44% in Phoenix to 25.7% in Jacksonville.  The latest data illustrates a reset in seller expectations compared with the same month last year. With the exception of Portland, the metropolitan areas listed above also experienced the greatest year-over-year increase in the share of listings with price reductions.  Nationally, homes also took longer to sell, with the typical home spending seven more days on the market this month than during September 2021. Compared with the year prior, days on the market increased most in Raleigh, N.C.; Austin; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Charlotte N.C.; Riverside, Calif.; Denver; Nashville; Orlando, Fla.; and Sacramento.  Despite the uptick in price cuts, the median listing price in September remained higher than year-ago levels in all but two of the large metropolitan areas: Pittsburgh and New Orleans. The median listing price nationally was $427,000, representing a year-over-year increase of 13.9%, Realtor.com said.  The data is the latest to illustrate the housing market\\'s quick shift from the early pandemic\\'s buying frenzy to today\\'s affordability-driven pullback as mortgage rates rise. The average 30-year fixed rate more than doubled this year as the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy to combat inflation, according to weekly Freddie Mac data.  Higher mortgage rates is one reason why the National Association of Realtors earlier this week revised down its existing-home sale and price expectations for 2023. The trade group expects sales to slump to their slowest annual rate since 2012 next year, and foresees annual price growth of 1.2%.  Amid the gloomy news is a potential bright spot for prospective buyers: the slower market could result in more wiggle room for those previously pushed to the sidelines by competition earlier in the pandemic. \"For prospective buyers grappling with affordability, you may have more bargaining power than you realize, particularly in areas where time on market is rising,\" Danielle Hale, chief economist of Realtor.com, said.

       " 'Biden touts Inflation Reduction Act, critics say student loan cancellation offsets gains Missouri Western State College ; St Joseph, MO - news  By  (The Center Square) - President Joe Biden touted the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act during a speech Tuesday, but analysts point to the recent student debt cancellation as an \"offset\" of any reduced inflation and federal debt reduction.  Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, praised spending items in the bill, pointing to deficit reductions in the legislation and overall since the COVID-era spike in relief spending.  \"So I don\\'t want to hear it anymore about big-spending Democrats,\" he said. \"We spend, but we pay.\"  A recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, found that that the cost to taxpayers to cancel $10,000 to $20,000 per borrower in student debt will more than offset the debt and inflationary benefits of the IRA.  The Congressional Budget Office said that the IRA will cut the deficit by $238 billion over the next decade.  More from this section  AHA News: She Had a Stroke During a Video Call With Her Congressional Representative  How to Start Saving for Your Kids\\' College  Fewer Pet Neuterings in Pandemic Means Shelters Are Filling Up  But the CRFB estimates Biden\\'s debt cancellation will cost taxpayers more than double that amount, offsetting those gains twofold.  \"The student debt cancellation and relief measures recently announced by the Biden Administration will cost roughly $500 billion over ten years under our estimates, wiping out the $238 billion of ten-year deficit reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act more than two times over,\" the group said. \"In total, we estimate the student debt proposals will cost as much as the first 16 years of IRA deficit reduction on a nominal basis and the first 21 years of deficit reduction on a present value basis.\"  The group goes on to say its analysis is likely \"generous\" in the Biden administration\\'s favor.  \"Our estimates may prove overly generous, as they are based on our central estimate, do not incorporate a likely uptick in loans as a result of the new policies, and assume smooth implementation of the IRA,\" the CRFB said. \"Under our higher-end estimate of the student loan plan, it will consume roughly 18 years of IRA savings on a nominal basis and roughly 25 years on a present value basis. If expiring Affordable Care Act subsidy expansions were extended without offsets in the IRA, the student loan plan might consume over 25 years of the savings on a nominal basis, and it is not clear whether such a plan would ever generate enough deficit reduction to finance the student debt cancellation on a present value basis.  \"In addition, as we have pointed out before, the inflationary effects of the new student debt plan will far outweigh any disinflationary effects from the IRA,\" the group added.

       " 'Students react to Biden\\'s student debt relief plan University of Mississippi ; University, MS - news  By Alyssa Conrad  Graphic by Savannah Shook.  Recently, President Joe Biden made good on his promise to forgive student loan debt. In an official statement addressing the student loan relief plan released on Aug. 24, Biden said it will allow people to \"finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt to get on top of their rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.\"  Citizens with annual adjusted gross salaries less than $125,000 (or $250,000 per household) will receive $10,000 off their student loan debt. Citizens with qualifying salaries who are also eligible for a Pell Grant will receive an additional $10,000 off their student loans.  In order to qualify, the loans must be federal, not privately issued. Some current students are also eligible for student loan cancellation, based on free application for federal student aid and whether or not they filed as independent or dependent. Student loan forgiveness for independent students will be based on their own incomes, whereas parent incomes will be taken into account for those who filed as dependents.  Like citizens across the country, UM students have mixed feelings about the plan.  \"I think it\\'s dumb because it\\'s not fixing the underlying problem of higher education being too expensive in the first place,\" Mary-Patt Robben, a sophomore public policy major, said.  Robben believes that student loan forgiveness is not the correct way to combat the increasing cost of a college education and only provides a temporary solution for the issue.  But that isn\\'t how everyone feels about the topic of student loan forgiveness. UM senior Jared Holly, a psychology and nursing major, wholeheartedly supports the new plan.  \"I\\'m all for it. I\\'ll pay the taxes or whatever it takes. I\\'m not even necessarily one of those students in debt - I\\'m grateful to have parents who pay for my education, but I think we should cancel out more,\" Holly said.  Preston Kennedy, a sophomore international studies major also supports the plan, but he thinks that the plan does not go far enough.  \"I feel like, if we\\'re going to spend this much, we should just forgive it all,\" Kennedy said. \"It\\'s a step in the right direction, but if we\\'re willing to spend billions of dollars on this, we should just go all the way.\"  It is estimated that around 8 million citizens will get their expected debt forgiveness without needing to take any additional action because their current income information is on file with the U.S. Department of Education. For those without up to date income information on file, there will be an online form released where they can claim the debt forgiveness if they qualify for it. This application is expected to be released within the coming months.  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))',\n",

Another Republican politician voiced intentions to legally challenge President Joe Biden\\'s student-loan forgiveness.  Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovichtold CNBC on Tuesday it might be too soon to bank on Biden\\'s announcement to forgive $10,000 to $20,000 in student-loan debt for federal borrowers making under $125,000 a year. He said Biden is on \"very, very shaky legal grounds right now.\"  \"I think there\\'s a lot of people celebrating prematurely,\" Brnovich told CNBC. \"A lot of other people are very upset about this, not only because of legal arguments, but because they believe it\\'s fundamentally unfair.\"  The Biden administration said the authority to wipe out that debt is granted under the HEROES Act of 2003, which gives the Education Secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like COVID-19.  But critics of the plan have argued that is an overreach of the authority, and the legal grounds do not exist for the president to cancel that amount of student debt.  Brnovich added that a lawsuit should be filed \"sooner rather than later\" so borrowers do not become to reliant on relief, and he said he\\'s confident he can find a plaintiff that could challenge Biden\\'s actions.  \"If we can bring a challenge, we will bring a challenge,\" Brnovich said.  While there was legal debate prior to Biden\\'s announcement of loan forgiveness, the conversation has only amplified since then. Biden\\'s Education and Justice Departments both released memos concluding the Education Secretary does have the authority to enact one-time blanket relief due to pandemic-caused financial hardship, and they also rescinded a memo from former President Donald Trump saying the authority to cancel student debt broadly does not exist.  Still, Republicans and conservative groups have said they are pursuing legal routes to overturn the policy. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, toldThe Washington Post that he is \"brainstorming\" ways to block debt relief after acknowledging it could be difficult to find a plaintiff. Abby Shafroth, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, also previously told Insider that it will be difficult to prove someone has suffered a concrete injury as a result of Biden\\'s debt cancellation.  For now, it\\'s unclear how any legal action will progress, and the Education Department is continuing to tell federal borrowers to prepare for an application for relief to become live in early October, and they will have until the end of next year to submit their form.

       " 'Money,Tips,Bills,Cost of living,Energy bills,Money Saving Expert CLUED-UP Martin Lewis explains how to calculate your new energy bill as price freeze announced MARTIN Lewis has responded to Liz Truss\\' new energy support package and explained how you can calculate your energy bills.  Under the new Energy Price Guarantee, a typical family will pay no more than £2,500 a year from October, for the next two years.  Martin Lewis has responded to the news on Twitter and listed 15 summary points following the Prime Minster\\'s statement.  One of Martin\\'s points explains how you can calculate what you\\'ll pay from October.  Right now the energy bill for a typical household that pays by direct debit comes to £1,971 a year.  However, from October 1, the new Energy Price Guarantee comes into force and these households can expect to pay £2,500 over the next year.  This new figure includes the £400 energy bill discount that\\'ll be paid between October and March next year.  We\\'ve listed how each energy supplier will pay the discount from next month.  Martin Lewis says that the slight rise to bills represents a 6.5% increase for the typical household.  He said: \"To estimate what you\\'ll pay, over a year, multiply your current energy costs by 6.5%.  Martin said that the figure you\\'ll get will include the £400 energy bill discount - so if you want to know how much you\\'ll pay after the discount is paid make sure to deduct £400 from your final figure.  For example if your monthly direct debit is £150 right now, from October it will rise to £159.75.  If your monthly direct debit is currently £200, from October it will hit £213.  Today, the Prime Minister also announced that:  * Businesses will receive energy bill support for at least six months  * Millions excluded by the price cap to get support from a new fund  It remains unclear as to whether the Energy Price Guarantee set at £2,500 will be the same for energy customers who don\\'t pay by direct debit or who have a prepayment meter.  We will update the story once we have more information on the logistics of the scheme.  What is the Energy Price Guarantee?  Liz Truss has frozen energy bills at £2,500 a year for a period 24 months.  The Energy Price Guarantee will mean a typical family will pay no more than £2,500 a year, saving households £1,000 a year on average.  However, the cap is just on what firms can charge customers.  Your bill could be higher, based on your energy usage. So if you use more, expect to pay more.  However, if you use less energy than the average household, you\\'ll pay less than £2,500 across the next year.  The £2,500 figure includes the £400 energy bill discount.  This means typical households will only fork out £2,100 of their hard-earned cash across the year.',\n",

I personally am not in favor of abortion, but I don\\'t think I have that right to make that decision for anyone else. This is a difficult choice with pros and cons on both sides of the issue.  However, this like many other issues has become a political statement that all Red Republicans are anti-abortion and Blue Democrats are pro-abortion.

I grew up back east and remember the old voting machines where you just pulled the top lever for the party of your choice and voted all Republican or all Democrat.

In the case of President Biden\\'s estimated one-trillion dollar student loan \"forgiveness,\" that debt will be assumed by those taxpayers who never attended college, those who did attend college but paid their own way by working part-time jobs, and those who attended college and dutifully paid back their student loans.  Earlier this year, Nancy Pelosi referenced Article 1, Section 9, Clause 7 of the U.S. Constitution in warning the president that he did not have the authority to forgive student loans.

       " \"Adviser Corner RETIREMENT: A step toward solving the retirement-savings gap; The Advancing Auto Portability Act of 2022 would encourage the widespread adoption of auto portability. Vanguard's How America Saves report for 2022 provided cause for optimism with some of its findings. Participation rates in Vanguard-managed defined contribution plans remain high, and the majority of participants increased or maintained their contributions last year; the average account balance increased by 10% YOY to $141,542.  However, the report underscored that premature cash-outs of small 401(k) balances continue to threaten retirement readiness for plan participants. But the report also noted a potential solution: Auto Portability.  Auto portability is the routine and automated movement of a participant's 401(k) savings account from their former employer's plan to their current employer's plan. It was conceived and built to meet the needs of plan participants with account balances of less than $5,000, who often lack access to portability solutions.  Earlier this year, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) introduced the Advancing Auto Portability Act of 2022, which would enable the adoption of auto portability by plan sponsors and recordkeepers nationwide.  This proposed legislation would make it much easier for participants to consolidate their 401(k)s when they change jobs, helping them avoid the destructive decision to cash out. On average, cashing out account balances prematurely can decrease savings for retirement by 25%, according to Boston College's Center for Retirement Research.  The Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI) has found that 14.8 million plan participants switch employers every year, and nearly one-third of them will cash out their 401(k) within a year of that change.  This cash-out rate is higher than average for minorities (63% for Black Americans, 57% for Latinos), those who earn $20,000 to $30,000 in annual income (50%), or are between ages 20 and 29 (44%). It is also higher than average for women (41%), and those ages 25 to 34 (71%).  EBRI estimates that the nationwide adoption of auto portability would preserve up to $1.5 trillion in additional retirement savings, measured in today's dollars, over the course of 40 years. That would include approximately $191 billion for 21 million Black Americans and $619 billion for all minority plan participants.  The legislation, which would create a $500 tax credit to assist businesses with auto portability implementation costs, has received bipartisan support both in and out of Congress, including from the NAACP and the National Urban League, whose leaders have identified and spoken out on the value auto portability can have in reducing the wealth gap. A 2017 letter from Senator Scott to the Department of Labor on the matter received backing from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Benefits Council.  This broad support has been crucial for getting us to this point. If signed into law, the retirement-savings gaps in our society can begin to be filled.\",\n",

We previously revealed how Costco customers can find out the price of fuel and their nearest forecourt on its website.  But how do you find out where your nearest Asda petrol station is and how much fuel might cost?  Asda's website has a petrol station locator tool where you can enter your postcode and it will take you to the nearest forecourt.  For example, if you live in Bromley, Kent, your nearest forecourt will be the Asda in Charlton, roughly 4 to 5 miles away.  If you live in Birmingham city centre, your nearest forecourt is the Asda in Small Heath.  If you're based near Bearsden train station on the outskirts of Glasgow, your closest fuel forecourt is in Bearsden, just half a mile away.  However, while you can find the nearest fuel station with the tool, you'll struggle to find prices.  An Asda spokesperson said the best way to find out prices at your nearest station was to actually go there.  This is because prices fluctuate on a daily basis so it's hard to give an accurate estimate.  How can you find out about cheap local prices?  If you don't want to leave the comfort of your home to drive around for the cheapest petrol there are alternatives.  There are websites that can tell you where to get the cheapest fuel in your local area.  On the PetrolPrices app and website, which compiles data from the public, you can check prices from more than 8,000 forecourts near you.  Comparison website Confused.com also has a petrol prices checker that lets registered users find petrol prices within a five, 10 or 25mile radius.  Finally, Fleet News and Allstar lets you check petrol prices across multiple counties to see how your area compares to others across the UK.  How can I reduce my fuel usage?  As well as shopping around for the cheapest fuel, there are tricks and hacks you can employ to actually cut your fuel usage down.  For example, avoiding harsh braking or other sudden movements in your vehicle will make for a smoother drive and reduce the amount you spend on fuel.  Decluttering your car by either removing unnecessary items or not filling your tank up to the brim will help to cut back on costs as well.  In addition, pumping your tyres up will create less drag on the road and reduce the amount of fuel or diesel you use.  We previously revealed a Tik Tokker's hacks to save on petrol.

       " 'MIL-OSI USA: Representative Adriano Espaillat Statement on Student Loan Relief for Borrowers Source: United States House of Representatives - Congressman Adriano Espaillat (NY-13)  NEW YORK, NY - Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement in response to President Biden\\'s actions to provide student loan relief for borrowers who need it the most.  \"During the campaign, President Biden promised to provide targeted student debt relief to working- and middle-class families, and today, he kept his promise by taking actions that fulfil that commitment and provide breathing room to borrowers as they prepare to resume student loan payments following the COVID-19 pandemic,\" said Rep. Espaillat. \"A post-high school education should be a ticket to the middle-class, but over the years, we have witnessed the cost of college skyrocket to exorbitant amounts preventing far too many borrowers from being able to purchase a home, start a business, or save for retirement. Today\\'s student borrower relief is a step in the right direction, and I look forward to continuing my efforts in collaboration with President Biden and this administration to help American families get back on track, recover and thrive.\"  The Biden-Harris Administration announcement will:  * Forgive up to $20,000 of federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and up to $10,000 for other qualifying borrowers. Borrowers who earn less than $125,000 per year or households earning less than $250,000 are eligible for debt cancellation.  * Extend the federal student loan pause a final time through December 31, 2022 to provide borrowers a smooth transition back to repayment.  * Make the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers by cutting monthly payments in half for undergraduate loans and holding schools accountable when they hike up prices.  These actions will help borrowers who need it most - with nearly 90% of relief dollars going to borrowers earning less than $75,000 per year. Additionally, the actions taken today will continue to have a significant impact for current and future students. Under President Biden\\'s proposed changes to income-based repayment, the average borrower will save over $1,000 per year on loan payments, and the typical college borrower will see their loan payments cut in half.  More information will be available to borrowers in the coming weeks to find out whether they qualify for debt cancellation and more details on the proposed revamp to the repayment program. Visit studentaid.gov/debtrelief to sign up to be notified automatically when this information is available.  Today\\'s actions build on the steps that the Biden-Harris Administration has already taken to provide over $32 billion in loan relief to 1.6 million borrowers. That includes making temporary changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program so more public service workers can get their debt cancelled after 10 years of service. Individuals can apply right now - until October 31st - to take advantage of these temporary changes to the PSLF program. Visit PSLF.gov for more information.  # # #  MIL OSI USA News -',\n",
       " 'Money,News Money SCHOOL OF THOUGHT I dropped out of school but become a millionaire at 20 after being told I would never amount to anything by teachers A SCHOOL dropout has revealed how he managed to become a millionaire at the age of 20.  Entrepreneur Wil Massara, 20, was determined to succeed on his own after his teachers told him he would never amount to anything.  The young man from Perth who dropped out of school after he failed Year 12, aged 16, is now a millionaire thanks to his own business but says he \"does not like to waste money on flashy things\".  Massara founded his company Youth Leadership Academy Australia which has now expanded to schools across the country when he was just 15.  As he wasn\\'t interested in formal education, he decided to drop out of school and focus entirely on his business.  He told Daily Mail Australia: \"Young people are less ready to sit and be told by executives what to do and be bossed around by them.  \"We are ready to take action. We are the least quiet generation that\\'s existed.  \"Those who have no interest in learning about our generation and our values should have no input in what they expect of us.\"  Massara also shared how he was told by his school principal he would never get a university degree.  Despite not having graduated High School, the 20-year-old has now almost finished his Master\\'s in Business Administration.  Massara\\'s first business, founded when he was just 11, is called Planepidea-a website he calls the \"Wikipedia of planes\".  The business led him to a partnership with Qantas and Singapore Airlines before being invited to Qantas\\' first Boeing 787 flight from Perth.  He said: \"I was standing there in shorts and a T-shirt surrounded by all these executives when I decided I wouldn\\'t let age determine what I could do.\"  His current business, YLAA, runs workshops on teen resilience and leadership at schools.  He added: \"The reason why we\\'ve grown so rapidly is that we respond with what young people need at the current stages of their lives - the education system sucks at that.\"  He has said the reason why he decided to drop out of school and build his own company was that he was so \"angry\".  He told news.com.au, back in 2020: \"As I went into year 11 that\\'s when I was so angry. There\\'s so much pressure in the ATAR (Australian Tertiary Admission Rank).  \"You get told to either get great results or you\\'ll amount to nothing, that\\'s the message the education department gives.\"  The 20-year-old recently enjoyed travelling around Thailand and Bali but says he doesn\\'t like wasting money and says he gets \"less than a full year\\'s salary at minimum wage\".  He is now working to turn YLAA into a social enterprise where the profits would go to youth suicide prevention programs.',\n",

       " \"Retirement After 50 years of progress, how prepared are women for retirement? A movement away from marriage does not appear to have undone economic gains We recently completed a study, using the Health and Retirement Study , to assess the retirement preparedness of women in the wake of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination in any educational activity receiving federal funding.  The gains for women as individuals over the last 50 years have been well documented. The percentage of women with a college degree has increased enormously, from 15% for those born in the 1930s to one third for late boomers, born in the early 1960s (see Figure 1). Higher education has translated into greater labor-force participation and a substantial reduction in the earnings gap between men and women.  On the other hand, women have chosen to spend less of their adult life married (see Table 1). They married later, more are never married, and more got divorced.  The question then is how this decline in marriage combined with economic gains affected the retirement preparedness of women. Preparation for retirement is measured in two ways: wealth and replacement rates.  Read: Gray divorce can be financially devastating - especially for women  Table 2 shows how wealth has changed across cohorts for women and men. (This analysis assigns the couple's full value to the woman and to the man.) For the earlier cohorts, women's wealth equaled 82% to 85% of men's; for the later cohorts, the comparable figures were 90% to 93%. Boomer men, who did not enjoy gains in education or earnings over time, appear to have been hit much harder than their female counterparts by the Great Recession.  Table 3 shows how the overall improvement in women's wealth relates to their marital status. The large decline in median wealth for women who spend their lives mostly married largely reflects declining fortunes for their husbands. Since the wealth of the mostly-single and never-married women has remained relatively stable, their holdings have increased sharply relative to the mostly married.  The ultimate purpose of retirement wealth, however, is to support people's preretirement standard of living in retirement. So, the following repeats the exercise for replacement rates -projected retirement income as a percentage of preretirement earnings. The results show that never married and mostly single women are now as well prepared for retirement as their mostly-married counterparts (see Table 4).  The conclusion, then, is that women do not appear to have undone their economic gains since Title IX's passage by opting to spend more time on their own. They have gained both income and wealth, and are as well prepared for retirement as married couples.

       " \"Regional Cost-of-living increase requires look at cashflow planning Whether you are in business or controlling a household budget there is no doubt that, with the cost-of-living increases, everyone needs to review their budgets and spending.  The basic principle is that you need to make enough income to cover your costs and expenses. If you cannot generate additional income, you need to look at ways to reduce costs. Businesses need to review their new cost structures to ensure their pricing covers at least the cost of providing the product or services.  One of the continuing impacts of Covid has been the delays in supply chain. Most businesses are seeing increases in the raw material and products they require, part of this being driven by the increase in freight costs, which of course isn't helped by the fuel price.  Low levels of unemployment create another challenge for businesses who are looking for staff. There are several ways to help keep and attract good people. Consider things such as flexible working arrangements, health insurance, and other benefits to give your business the edge.  Additionally, businesses are under pressure to increase wages to help members of their team cope with the increases in the cost of living.  It's become even more important to understand exactly what your business cash break-even point is. How much cash does the business need to generate to be able to pay the bills? In these uncertain times predicting income is going to be difficult and may require some crystal ball gazing; but at least if you know how much money is needed to pay the bills, you have a target to aim for.  For a business with predominantly fixed costs the calculation is very simple.  Add the total costs for the month and divide it by the number of working days eg, if your average monthly costs are, say, $11,000 and there are 22 working days in the month, then you need to generate $500 income per day.  Remember, you are dealing with all cash transactions, so you need to include loan repayments to the bank and IRD payments. You should also include the cash you need to withdraw from the business to pay personal costs you have, such as mortgage and grocery bills.  For retailers or wholesalers, it is slightly trickier as they must include the purchase cost of goods. However, the principle is the same. Using the above example if you have a gross profit margin of 20 per cent, you will need to sell $2500 of product per day to make a gross profit of $500 to cover your costs.  A simple spreadsheet which calculates your break-even position is available on our website www.pkffa.co.nz under Publications - use the search box.  By doing our best to pay our staff, suppliers and landlords, provides them with the cash to do the same, and so what goes around, comes around, especially in our local community.\",\n",

       " 'Money Martin Lewis issues £1,000 warning to everyone with a certain type of e-mail address Earlier this week, the Money Saving Expert handed out helpful advice about saving money on your broadband provider while fielding callers on ITV\\'s This Morning show  Martin Lewis has urged all households not to get an email address with your broadband provider -as it could make it more complicated for you to switch to a cheaper deal elsewhere.  Appearing on ITV This Morning, the financial guru fielded questions from callers -and one viewer named Pauline raised the issue of switching broadband providers.  While Pauline is currently with Virgin Media, she wished to change over to a more favourable deal with Vodafone but felt trapped by her Virgin Media email account.  Virgin Media had warned that her email accounts would be closed following the move, losing access to all of her data and contacts in the process.  Martin said that this would forever be an issue if you set up an email account with your provider, advising the public to break away and create an address using an independent server.  He said: \"On Virgin you get 90 days after giving notice. Some providers let you keep it, some don\\'t.  \"This is the classic reason for not setting up your own email address with your provider. You are going to have this issue forever.  \"You\\'re always going to find it difficult to move so here is my tip. Decide today that you\\'re going to set up, let\\'s say a Gmail account.  \"Start telling everyone you know to email you on Gmail. Auto-forward your current email address to Gmail so that it sends it to your new email address and you should always reply from there.  \"Do that for a couple of months until you\\'re pretty sure about everything and then leave Virgin. That gives you an extra 90 days, and you do need to check that.  \"After that you then have the flexibility to move.\"  Martin went on to demonstrate the financial benefits of making this shift.  He said that the flexibility to switch to cheaper providers could save up to £300 per annum, making savings of up to £1,000 within a few years.  \"It can easily save you up to £200 to 300 a year,\" he explained.  \"After a few years you could easily be up to £1,000 gained by going to the cheapest provider each time.  \"You need to break that habit of allowing them to lock you in by keeping your email. It will be a pain to do so but I suggest you take the time.\"  Millions of households are thought to be out of contract with their broadband provider.  Always compare prices to see if you\\'re getting the best deal -then if you want to leave, make sure you can do so penalty-free.  You could also try haggling your existing provider down in price if you\\'ve found a better deal elsewhere.',\n",

       " 'Money Holidaymakers face delays as fuel price protesters block M5 Slow-driving convoy caused long delays to those heading to Devon and Cornwall on the first day of the school holidays  Protesters campaigning against high fuel prices have disrupted holiday getaways to the south-west of England by driving in convoy slowly up and down a motorway before blockading a petrol station.  The convoy drove at 30mph on three lanes of the M5 north and south in Somerset and the Bristol area on Friday morning as tens of thousands of people headed to Devon and Cornwall to begin summer breaks.  They then blockaded a petrol station in Bridgwater, Somerset, only allowing access for emergency vehicles and essential workers.  By early afternoon there were delays of around almost an hour for people heading south-west, thought to have been caused by a combination of the knock-on effect of the demonstration coupled with normal heavy holiday traffic.  One of the demonstration\\'s organisers, Mikey Dave, a door supervisor from Somerset, said: \"We are protesting at the cost of living and fuel prices. We will show the government that enough is enough, and us, the public, want the cost of living sorted out for everyone.\"  After similar demonstrations earlier this month, it was reported that the Home Office wanted police forces to use new tough new powers to stop the fuel protests.  But there was no sign that police in Avon and Somerset were planning to take hardline action against the protesters, and Dave thanked the force for its help making sure the action went ahead safely.  Ahead of the protest, Supt Tony Blatchford, of Avon and Somerset police, said: \"Our protest liaison team has been engaging with the organiser so we can inform the public of the likely disruption and help to minimise it.  \"Nevertheless, drivers can expect journey times will likely be longer than normal, especially on motorways, which often tend to be at their busiest at this time of year. We advise motorists consider any alternative travel plans available and ensure they are suitably prepared in case they are delayed.\"  The M5 protest had ended by noon with those involved turning their attention on the petrol station blockade.  There appeared to be support for the protesters though some complained they risked disrupting people who least deserved it.  On the protest group\\'s Facebook page one person wrote: \"I\\'m totally behind everyone and something needs to be done, but you\\'re hitting the wrong people, the ones who will get delayed today are working-class people who have saved all year to take their children on a holiday which possibly they could miss. These company directors won\\'t be on the M5 or any other motorway today.\"  With most schools in England and Wales breaking up for summer this week, the RAC said an estimated 18.8 million leisure trips are planned in the UK between Friday and Monday - the most since the company began tracking summer getaway numbers in 2014.',\n",
       " 'News 66,000 sign up for internet discount; Eligible Iowans get break on high-speed service About 66,000 Iowa households have signed up for discounts on high-speed Internet service since a federal program was launched in May, according to figures a White House spokesperson shared with the Des Moines Register this week.  The release came as Vice President Kamala Harris plans to urge more residents to sign up for the program during a visit to North Carolina on Thursday, the spokesperson said.  Harris also sent Gov. Kim Reynolds and leaders in other states a letter urging them to promote the program, which allows some residents to receive a $30-a-month break on high-speed internet, and in some cases, free service.  \"Please help lower costs for more families by spreading the word in your state and by entering data-matching agreements to drive enrollment,\" Harris wrote.  Part of the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that President Joe Biden signed in November, the American Connectivity Program gives a $30 discount on monthly internet bills to eligible families - those earning no more than 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, or $46,060 for a family of three. The threshold means about 164,000 families in Iowa are eligible, based on U.S. census data.  Some rural Iowa households may not be able to take advantage of the program because they are in areas that don\\'t have access high-speed internet. For example, only 6% of homes in northwest Iowa\\'s Ida County have access, according to Broadband Now.  In addition to the discount, some internet providers agreed this year to create a new plan to offers eligible families high-speed internet for $30 a month - effectively providing free service to those enrolled in the program.  Since mid-May, the last time the White House aggressively pushed the program with news releases, about 7,000 households in Iowa have registered. The latest data suggests Iowans are signing up less frequently than some in other states.  The number of Iowa households that registered for the program ranks 36th in the country. But the number of families at 200% of the poverty level in Iowa - suggesting the number of houses eligible for the program - ranks 32nd in the country, according to the Census Bureau.  Internet plans participating in the program offer download speeds of 100 megabits per second.  The Federal Communications Commission currently defines high-speed internet as services with download speeds of 25 megabits per second. But FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel filed a notice of inquiry last week, alerting the public that the agency is considering upping its definition to the 100 megabits per second standard.  \"The needs of internet users long ago surpassed the FCC\\'s (current) speed metric, especially during a global health pandemic that moved so much of life online,\" Rosenworcel said in a statement.  The White House is making another push to sign up eligible households for discounts on high-speed internet service. | Pixabay',\n",
       " 'News Frugal farmer\\'s will ploughs £100m into charity A landowner who never married, had no children, shunned first-class travel, holidayed in Scotland and drove a \"clapped-out\" VW Beetle has left the majority of his £100 million estate to charities.  Simon Gibson died at the age of 94 in May and stipulated in his will that his estate, worth £103,857,487, went to the charitable trust which was created in his name in 1975 to support good causes in south Wales, Suffolk, Norfolk, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire.  As well as leaving hundreds of thousands of pounds to his close family, he gave tens of thousands to each employee who had worked at his 1,776 acre home, Landwades Hall, near Newmarket in Suffolk.  Gibson gave £30,000 to each current and former employee who had reached pensionable age during his lifetime. Shelagh Foster, his last carer who was born in South Africa, was left £75,000 along with his cottage and its contents in the seaside town of Aldeburgh. She was also allowed one of his cars to keep.  Colin McCarty, a former teacher at Newmarket Upper School who knew Gibson for nearly 40 years, said that he had enjoyed spending money on good causes. Gibson was awarded a CBE for his charitable works. He added: \"[Gibson] had a new Rolls-Royce, but I never saw him drive it. He was famed for driving around in his clapped-out yellow Beetle.\"  McCarty said that Foster took Gibson on a couple of holidays to South Africa in his \"twilight years\" but he often went on small cruises around Scotland\\'s lochs. He added: \"When I was a head teacher, he came in to discuss rearranging social rooms for students. The next day he walked in with a cheque for £25,000 to pay for the work.\"  Among the other stipulations in Gibson\\'s will was a £1 million gift to Ely Cathedral Trust along with legacies of £100,000 to the World Wildlife Fund, the National Trust, Pembroke College, Cambridge, King\\'s Ely, which is one of the world\\'s oldest schools, Great Ormond Street Hospital and St Edmundsbury Cathedral.  He also left £250,000 each to his ten nephews and nieces along with his shares in an investment company, and £10,000 each to his ten godchildren. His sister Mary and another close relative received £250,000 each and his sisterin-law was left £50,000.  The family fortune was established by his uncle, William Tatem, who went to sea as a cabin boy at the age of 12 but later formed the Atlantic Shipping Company which became the largest exporter of coal mined in Wales. He was made Lord Glanely in 1916.  In the interwar period he was a leading owner in flat racing and his horses won all five classics. He was killed in 1942 at the age of 74, during an air raid on Weston-super-Mare. His only child had died at the age of six.',\n",

       " \"Press Release: Legacy Suite Announces the Official Launch of Revolutionary Estate Planning System The platform has simplified critical data exchange and asset transfer for individuals interested in protecting their digital assets for the future.  NEW YORK, July 12, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital asset preservation platform Legacy Suite has announced the official rollout of its latest offering, leading a new frontier in EstateTech. The revolutionary estate planning and beneficiary management system is designed to streamline the legacy transfer process for all physical and digital assets. The announcement marks the latest Legacy Suite service launch, joining the likes of the platform's Digital Suite, Legal Suite, and Financial Suite offerings.  The digital revolution has given rise to a multitude of intangible assets. Digital estate planning is now an integral component of traditional estate planning. Assets such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), online banking accounts, and social media profiles are critical when managing a digital estate.  Through Legacy Suite, users can easily share critical information with beneficiaries, centralized digital asset custodians, social platforms, and crypto/NFT exchanges. Distributing data such as asset inventories, passwords, account credentials, login instructions, and more is simple through Legacy Suite's innovative technology. Beneficiaries can access an online hub that will guide them through a clear roadmap that outlines access permissions as provided and instructed by the original user(s).  Legacy Suite's lifetime digital asset management services include storing all documents related to user intent and Digital Will(TM) creation support. Digital Wills(TM) account for any electronic records, social accounts, and various digital accounts that would typically not be included in a traditional will.  While a Digital Will(TM) is not considered a legal document, as most states do not formally recognize digital estate plans at this time, it can be used informally to ensure that digital assets are addressed within a traditional estate plan. Legacy Suite's Digital Executors(TM) are assigned to individual users and are tasked with managing digital estates and addressing all items related to a user's digital assets after their passing.  To learn more about Legacy Suite's pioneering services in the digital estate planning space and to gain early access to the platform, please visit http://www.legacysuite.com.

       " 'Money,News Money,Shopping advice,Walmart SMART SHOPPING Seven sections never to spend your money in at Walmart - the store\\'s secret cash traps revealed EXPERTS have revealed seven \"money traps\" at Walmart and sections of the store you may want to avoid shopping in during your next trip.  The so-called \"secret cash traps\" encourage customers to spend more money than they originally intended, experts say.  In an article for GoBankingRates, author Jordan Rosenfeld lays out why not all of the deals you come across at Walmart are \"good\" deals.  Some psychology tactics apparently have been used in marketing to encourage you to spend more money at stores.  BAKERIES  The smell of baked goods is one way the retail giant reportedly draws people in.  While all Walmart stores don\\'t include a bakery, the ones that do usually strategically place them in the front of the store.  \"Stores that include a bakery up front are more likely to draw customers in with their delectable smells and the emotional connections that brings,\" the American Baker\\'s Association said.  BIGGER CARTS  Walmart\\'s shopping carts are apparently larger than an average grocery cart, stimulating customers to spend more money.  If a customer sees a good deal on big-sized items that can fit into their shopping cart, they are more inclined to buy it, according to Mashed.  \\'EVERYDAY LOW PRICES\\'  Walmart is known for its \"Everyday Low Prices\" and they don\\'t want their customers to forget it.  Mashed reported that stores can have as many as 100 signs advertising their \"Everyday Low Prices.\"  By seeing this promotion, customers will eventually connect the idea of low-priced items to Walmart.  POPULAR ITEMS  Walmart reportedly intentionally puts popular items in the back of their stores to drive foot traffic.  While each store is different, one store could be as big as 260,000 square feet, according to 24/7 Wall Street.  The more you walk around the store, the more inclined you are to purchase something.  ROLLBACK PRICES  The quick sale, known as a rollback, offers short-lived discounts on items for customers.  Customers shouldn\\'t assume that items with a rollback sign will be on sale for a long time, so buying them at a lower price is recommended instead of waiting.  \\'ACTION ALLEY\\'  Walmart reportedly utilizes the \"Action Alley\" strategy, which involves a wide aisle-shaped big square across the store, with specific locations that house many low-priced items.  The retail giant attempted to get rid of these areas due to customer complaints about clutter but reportedly saw sales dip, according to the GoBankingRates article.  The company now utilizes the marketing tactic in high-traffic areas.  LAST-MINUTE NEEDS  The article also claims that Walmart uses the \"last-minute needs\" ideal to its advantage.  Walmart is known for putting \"impulse buy\" items at the cash registers, according to Business Insider.  Items like candy, small toys, and magazines can be found there and customers apparently realize they \"need\" them just prior to checkout.',\n",

       " 'Tax Families still £1,300 worse off this year despite National Insurance cut Boris Johnson\\'s \\'biggest tax cut of the decade\\' is not enough to offset rising costs  Households will still be thousands of pounds worse off this year, despite Boris Johnson hailing the biggest tax cut of the decade.  The Government has said moving the National Insurance threshold to £12,570, up from £9,880, would result in tax cuts for 30 million people. Boris Johnson said 70pc of workers would benefit, saying he was on the side of families facing tough times.  But the change, which comes into effect today, will not be enough to offset rising costs for the average worker.  This is because wages excluding bonuses are failing to keep pace with inflation, rising 4.2pc at present. Inflation however, has already hit a 40-year high of 9.1pc and is expected to reach double digits by the end of the year.  It means average earners who have been promised big tax savings will in fact end up worse off.  A worker on an income of £30,000 can expect to pay £142 less in NI payments for the 2022-23 tax year thanks to the rise in the main threshold, for example. However, the same worker will see their spending power eroded by £1,470 over the course of the year thanks to inflation rising faster than their salaries. This will leave them £1,328 worse off overall, according to analysis from mutual Scottish Friendly.  Kevin Brown, of the firm, said Boris Johnson\\'s \"tax cut\" would not help lower-income households. \"Despite some headline savings on contributions, average income households are still going to be much worse off thanks to inflation and its effect on wages,\" he said.  Others pointed out that higher earners would still end up paying more in NI this year as the Prime Minister increased the rates of NI in April by 1.25 percentage points to help pay for health and social care.  Nick Bustin, of the tax firm Haysmacintyre, said the threshold change was \"no silver bullet to ease the cost of living crisis\". He said the tax cut was a \"knee-jerk\" reaction to increasing rates just a few months before.  This, he said, had made it harder for people to understand just how much better or worse off they will be this year.  He added: \"While those earning under £40,000 will be better off overall, make no mistake, these changes are complex. An employee who has remained on the same salary between March and July will have paid three different amounts in NI.  \"Last year, a person earning £20,000 would have paid £104 per month in NI contributions, in April that figure rose to £112 but it will now fall to £82,\" he said. \"However, someone earning £70,000 will now pay £467 per month, up from £439 before April - although less than the £499 they\\'ve paid over the past few months.\"',\n",

       " 'News House buying just got harder IT has never been harder to buy a home in South Australia, new data shows. Market analysis from PropTrack reveals homebuyers require 120.2 per cent of their annual household income to save for a 20 per cent deposit.  In contrast, in 1990, when interest rates sat at a record high 17.5 per cent, buyers needed just 49.9 per cent of their income for a deposit.  Economist Saul Eslake said it was not easy for those trying to buy a home. \"It\\'s probably the most difficult time in Australia\\'s history to raise the deposit required to enter home ownership,\" he said.  \"However, if you can raise the deposit, then servicing a mortgage is not as difficult as it has been on a number of occasions over the past 30 or so years because interest rates, although they have risen 75 basis points from their all-time lows, are nonetheless still very low by historic standards.\" This increase in required percentage of income, coupled with the rising cost of living, paints a similar picture to those conditions experienced in 1990.  Comparing commodity price increases over the past year with the 12 months to 1990, fruit and vegetable price rises stand out as an obvious impost on buyers and savers.  These are up 6.7 per cent over the past year, whereas in the 12 months to 1990, they dropped by 0.7 per cent.  Meat and seafood prices have also increased more in the past year than in the 12 months to 1990 - up 6.2 per cent this year, compared with 5.7 per cent in 1990.  Mr Eslake said he suspected housing affordability would \"get worse\" over the next year \"because the impact of higher rates will probably outweigh the impact of lower prices\".  Despite this, Real Estate Institute of South Australia interim chief executive Cain Cooke said people were still buying houses.  \"A lot of people have been trying to buy for some time and they\\'re still in the market,\" he said. \"I\\'d certainly say to them to not be despondent, there is a way, but it certainly is a challenging time.\" To help make home ownership more attainable, HomeStart has a shared equity option, allowing people to borrow on 75 per cent of the value of a property.  HomeStart effectively acts as a \"silent party\" for the other 25 per cent. The lender shares in any gain or loss when the house is sold, chief executive Andrew Mills said. \"The advantage is that the homebuyer is only making regular repayments and paying interest on their part of the loan and not the shared equity portion,\" he said.  Mortgage broker and musician Roger Gonzalez, 40, and his visual effects artist wife Kate, 45, bought a home in Clarence Gardens last year through HomeStart and said home ownership had always been a dream. \"Saving while renting was really tricky but we\\'re so happy now,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'It Depends - What did the High Court in Hill v Zuda decide about binding death benefit nominations in SMSFs? In this edition of \\'It depends\\', partner Scott Hay-Bartlem talks about the recent Hill v Zuda High Court decision on binding death benefit nominations in self-managed superannuation funds.  VIDEO TRANSCRIPT  Welcome to this \\'It depends\\' where I\\'m talking about what the High Court decided about binding death benefit nominations in self-managed superannuation funds in the recent case of Hill v Zuda.  So, Zuda Pty Ltd was the trustee of The Holly Superannuation Fund which was a self-managed superannuation fund. One of the members died and his daughter challenged his binding death benefit nomination on the basis it did not comply with the specific rules for binding death benefit nominations in the superannuation rules.  The High Court decided that the provisions of the superannuation laws that apply to binding death benefit nominations do not apply in self-managed superannuation funds.  Okay, so this means that when we\\'re doing binding death benefit nominations in self-managed superannuation funds, it all comes down to the trust deed. So, you\\'ll have to, say with me. Read the deed, read the deed, read the deed. The specific provisions in the superannuation laws about three-year lapsing\\'s and two witnesses are not relevant to SMSFs unless of course your trust deed says so. And it comes back to looking at your deed and following it precisely.  Well, this is our \"it depends\". So, the High Court challenge on this particular issue has been sorted out, but there are many, many, many other issues, and many other ways we see binding benefit nominations being challenged. So, does it follow the deed, have we worded it properly? Does it have the result that we want? Does it work in with the overall estate plan? We still see many disputes about binding death benefit nominations. It\\'s not all okay yet.  Now, join Clinton Jackson and I on the 3rd of June at: pm. We\\'ll do a webinar. We\\'ll talk about all this in far more detail. Thanks for watching this It depends.  © Cooper Grace Ward Lawyers  Cooper Grace Ward is a leading Australian law firm based in Brisbane.

       " \"Motors,News,Ford Motor Company,Money saving,Skoda,Volkswagen TAKE COVER I'm a car expert and these are the CHEAPEST cars to insure saving you the most money The cheapest cars to insure in Britain have been revealed across a range of different types.  The data is based on May 2022 and the categories include the best cars for new drivers, young drivers, families, sports car fans and those looking to go electric.  Based on insurance premiums from Admiral Insurance, the study found that geographically the UK average annual premium cost for car insurance in May was £574.  Drivers in Scotland get the best value premiums, paying 13% less than the UK average with annual costs of £497.  Unsurprisingly, premiums were highest in Greater London with costs of £750, a 31% increase on the UK average.  And despite Admiral confirming it doesn't calculate insurance based on gender, its May pricing figures showed that men paid 21% more for their premiums than women, at an average of £623 compared to £514.  Best for new drivers - Volkswagen Up!  Insurance for new drivers is notoriously expensive but the Volkswagen Up is here to help.  The maximum insurance group it sits in is group four out of 50, but the majority are actually in one or two.  That means it's the cheapest average quote from Admiral for new drivers at £750.12 for the year.  Best for 17-25 year olds - Skoda Citigo  The Skoda Citigo was actually slightly cheaper to buy when new than the VW Up and is essentially the same car.  It's the cheaper option for slightly older drivers between the ages of 17 and 25, though.  Most of the Citigo's models fall into groups one or two for insurance and Admiral's average quote is £512.18 for the year.  Best for families - Ford Puma  If you need a slightly bigger car fit for a family the Ford Puma is a great choice.  It looks the part and has a decent amount of space for rear passengers and luggage. It's great to drive too.  With it sitting in insurance groups as low as 14, it's Admiral's cheapest family motor at an average of £303.19 for the year.  Best for going electric - Volkswagen ID.3  It's no secret that electrics will save you money on 'fuel' but they're still more expensive to buy on average.  They're also more expensive to insure on average, but some are sensibly priced.  The best is the VW ID.3 which has an average premium of £379.69 with Admiral and the MG5 wasn't dar behind that.

       " 'Money Bargain hunter explains supermarket mistake that costs you £200 every month Tom Church, 31, who is one of the co-founders of LatestDeals.co.uk, says he is a \"disloyal\" shopper and always visits different stores to make sure he gets the best prices  A bargain hunter has explained how he saves roughly £200 each month in the supermarkets by comparing prices.  Dad-of-one Tom Church, 31, who is one of the co-founders of LatestDeals.co.uk, says he is a \"disloyal\" shopper and always visits different stores to get the best prices.  There are websites and apps that let you check prices online so you don\\'t have to go store-to-store.  \"Comparing prices only takes a couple of seconds when you write your shopping list. I use the free supermarket price comparison tool on the Latest Deals app,\" said Tom.  \"I just search \\'Fairy Liquid\\' or \\'Heinz Baked Beans\\' and see which supermarket has it cheapest.  \"Then I group the items under each supermarket and whizz around them to get the best prices.\"  He added: \"When I go to the supermarkets now it\\'s clearly more expensive.  \"I tend to stick to a fixed amount every time I shop, and I noticed I was getting less and less for my money.\"  Five price comparisons  * Anchor Salted Butter -£2 at Tesco; £2.45 at Iceland  * John West Tuna -£3 at Asda; £5 at Ocado  * TRESemme ProPure Airlight Volume Shampoo -£3 at Sainsbury\\'s; £4.50 elsewhere  * BodyForm Sanitary Towels -£1 at Sainsbury\\'s; £1.55 at Morrisons.  * McCain\\'s Chips -£3 at Waitrose; Asda at £4  \"I save about £200 a month on my family\\'s shopping by comparing prices and going to the cheapest supermarket whenever possible for each item,\" said Tom.  \"Even when I\\'m in a store and think of a product I didn\\'t research before I came out, I only have to look it up on the app and within seconds I\\'ll know if I need to head elsewhere for a better price.\"  Another way to compare prices online is by using Trolley.co.uk.  As well as comparing prices, you should try to avoid convenience stores if you can -and always shop in larger stores.  Which said households spend up to £10.20 more each week at a Sainsbury\\'s Local rather than a regular Sainsbury\\'s supermarket.  This was the biggest difference spotted by the consumer magazine over the course of a year.  Over the 12-month period, the average weekly difference added up to a staggering £322 over the course of a year.  Meanwhile, a basket of groceries from Tesco Express cost on average £279 more over 12 months.  Another way to cut your grocery shop is to try \"downshifting\" branded products for supermarket-own labels.  It is estimated this could save you around 30%.  This means if you spend £100 each week on food, you could save £30 -over four weeks, you\\'ll have pocketed £120.',\n",

       " 'Student loan ABS delinquencies see slight upticks The three major sector of the student loan asset-backed securities (SLABS) market experienced saw increases in metrics such as charge-offs, delinquencies, forbearances and deferments in Q1 2022, as well as a small quarterly decrease in prepayment speeds, according to a recent assessment from Morningstar | DBRS.  Those changes, however, were generally slight across the board, so industry observers did not raise alarms about SLABS\\' immediate or near-term performance. The notes\\' underlying loans are expected to continue to be resilient, based on borrower profiles.  Among refinance SLABS, borrowers were financially strong when the loans were originated, and they work in professions with low unemployment rates, according to DBRS. Cumulative chargeoffs on the oldest vintages, particularly 2013 and 2014, were 0.2% and 0.3% of the initial principal balances, after 57 and 61 months of seasoning, respectively.  Similarly, average monthly 30-plus day delinquencies were 0.38% of the total outstanding principal balance, a slight increase from 0.32% that the pools experienced in Q4 2021, but more than twice the 0.17% recorded in Q1 2021.  Borrowers that availed themselves of forbearance represented 0.56% of the total principal balance of outstanding refinance ABS transactions, a drop from 1.27% in Q1 2021, according to DBRS. As for deferments, on average the deferment usage rate was 0.47% in Q1 2022, an increase from the average usage rates of 0.32% recorded in Q1 2021, the rating agency said.  There was a slight uptick from the average rate of 0.44% in Q4 2021, the rating agency noted, which reflected a general increase in deferment usage over time. In June 2018, for instance, deferment usage was 0.10%.  \"The general increase over time is likely attributable to lenders originating a growing proportion of loans to borrowers who are refinancing only undergraduate degrees,\" according to DBRS\\'s report.  Among traditional private SLABS, total securitized volume stood at about $122.7 million, a small increase over the prior quarter, and a year-over-year increase of 11.9%. DBRS noted that outstanding securitization balance continues to decline, overall, the effect of prepayments and regular loan amortization. The latter continues to outpace growth in ABS collateral volumes.  As for ABS performance among private SLABS, the rating agency noted that annualized gross defaults were 1.8% of the repayment balance, compared with 1.7% in Q4 2021, and 1.3% in Q1 2021.  Despite these results, annualized gross defaults remain low and are about 77% lower than the peak annualized gross defaults of about 8.0% that the segment experienced in Q3 2009.  According to DBRA, securitizations completed after 2008 were secured by loans to stronger borrowers than those in pre-crisis vintages.  As for FFELP student loan ABS, 10.4% of average repayment balances was 30-days delinquent. Forbearances stood at 10.6% of the outstanding balance, a bump up from the average forbearance rate of 10.5% in Q1 2021, according to the rating agency.',\n",

       " 'News State pension age increase linked to rise in poverty rate IFS report  Poverty rates among 65-year-olds in Britain have doubled following an increase in the state pension age, according to an analysis by a leading think-tank.  Between 2018 and 2020, the state pension age for men and women rose from 65 to 66, resulting in about 700,000 65-year-olds having to wait another year before they could claim a state pension of about £142 per week.  The subsequent increase in tax revenues raised from 9 per cent of 65-yearolds staying in work longer and the reduction in state benefits led to a £4.9bn annual boost to Treasury coffers, according to the report published today by the Institute for Fiscal Studies.  But the reform also led to a sharp rise in older households living below the poverty line, particularly those not in paid work, the research found.  Absolute income poverty levels, after housing costs, for 65-year-olds rose by 14 percentage points, or nearly 100,000 people, to reach 24 per cent by late 2020, according to the report.  The less well-educated, renters and single people were hardest hit, with poverty rates among these groups increasing by more than 20 percentage points.  The analysis comes as the government considers whether to push ahead with faster rises in the state pension age, against a backdrop of an ageing population. The state pension age is already set to increase for men and women to 67 between 2026 and 2028, while an independent review of the pension age is considering whether a scheduled increase to 68 should be brought forward by seven years to 2037-39.  The increase in the state pension age pushed down the net income of 65-yearolds by an average of £108 per week, accounting for all forms of income, including state pensions, earnings, other benefits, private pensions and investment incomes.  \"These statistics are shocking,\" said Emily Andrews, deputy director for work at the Centre for Ageing Better, which funded the IFS research. \"The severity of this situation means it is crucial the government gets serious on improving access to work for people in their 60s.\"  Baroness Ros Altmann, a former pensions minister, said the findings were \"truly shocking\", adding: \"The scale of increased poverty caused by the rise in state pension starting age is further evidence that the blunt cost-saving tool of increasing state pension age is creating increased social injustice.\"  In the current year 2022-23, a full new weekly state pension is worth £185. According to government data, the state pension makes up just over half of income for middle-income pensioners, and more than 80 per cent of income for the poorest fifth of pensioners.  The Department for Work and Pensions said it provided a strong welfare safety net, which included universal credit, for those who could not work approaching pension age.  \\'The blunt cost-saving tool of increasing state pension age is creating increased social injustice\\'',\n",
       " \"Voluntary National Insurance: How to boost your state pension entitlement THE NATIONAL Insurance threshold is set to rise next month which could put some Britons behind on their qualifying years for state pension. However, they could be able to fill the gaps.  The amount of state pension one receives once they hit 66 depends largely on how many 'qualifying years' they have. However, these years don't always have to be worked as they can also be bought through voluntary National Insurance.  Related articles  A qualifying year is defined as a tax year during which a person has paid or been credited with enough National Insurance contributions to count towards state pension.  With the threshold rising, many will find themselves with more cash in the pocket as they now fall below the lowest tax bracket but it will in turn stop them from earning qualifying years through their work.  An alternative to working, or being credited, for National Insurance contributions, are voluntary contributions.  These can be bought at any point in one's life, making it a life saver for many who get to state pension age and realise they are a few years short.  READ MORE: Martin Lewis shares the 'best thing' to do with inheritance money  Additionally, voluntary contributions can fill up one's National Insurance record and potentially make them eligible for contribution-based benefits.  The deadline for paying voluntary contributions is April 5 each year.  Britons can pay these contributions to cover the past six years, but some circumstances may mean they can go further back.  There are different voluntary contributions rates as well, with class two and three counting towards both state pension and different contributory benefits.

       " 'Pensions retirement Retirees with cursed company pensions lose £75m to inflation 200,000 Britons will have payouts capped despite rocketing inflation  Almost 200,000 British pensioners whose old employers have gone bust will be thousands of pounds poorer in retirement, as they are denied inflation-linked boosts.  The Pension Protection Fund acts as a safety net for savers in final salary or \"defined benefit\" schemes by guaranteeing to pay their pension if their employer goes under.  But retirees whose pensions are in the lifeboat fund will be among the hardest hit by the cost of living crisis, forced to watch their spending power fall by hundreds of pounds. The amount their pensions increase by next April will be capped at 2.5pc or frozen, falling far short of runaway inflation, which is expected to reach 10pc this year.  Hundreds of thousands of pensioners in the PPF will be more than £75m worse off in real terms, and will have little to no protection against rising prices. The fund pays out more than £1bn in pension income each year, amounting to £5,600 a year per person on average.  More than 83,000 elderly members will be dealt the hardest blow, as those with pensionable service before April 1997 won\\'t see any increase in their PPF benefits and so are especially vulnerable.  Helen Morrissey, of stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that the cap would come as a \"nasty shock\" after years of relatively low inflation.  \"Added to the 3.1pc increase in the state pension this low increase leaves many pensioners struggling to cope with the cost of essentials such as food, fuel and energy continuing to skyrocket and even those who are more comfortably off are still facing tough financial choices.\"  This will come as a double whammy for pensioners, after the Government suspended the state pension \"triple lock\" for a year. Pensions only rose by 3.1pc this April after the Government ignored an abnormal 8.1pc wage growth figures impacted by furlough. The controversial decision left over-66s £13,000 poorer over an average retirement.  A PPF spokesman said the group recognised the impact that the cost of living crisis is having on everyone but that as a public corporation, it had to stick to compensations set out in legislation. He said: \"We were set up by the Government to pay members of eligible defined benefit pension schemes compensation for their lost pensions if their employer failed.\"  If you become a member of the PPF and you are over the pension age of the scheme then you will receive 100pc of the pension in payment when the company enters insolvency. However, if the member is under the pension age or retired early then they will receive 90pc of what they were promised. This is currently subject to a cap of £40,020 per year at age 65.

       " 'DWP opens consultation on saver pension choices The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has opened a consultation to determine what support and information occupational scheme savers expect in the lead up to taking their pension, at the point of access, and as they start to use their savings.  The  call for input today (14 June) is focussed on trust-based schemes and builds on research conducted by the Financial Conduct Authority for the contract-based market.  The regulator found most savers choose the \"path of lease resistance\" when it comes to accessing savings which often sees savers take an income from their provider without shopping around for the most suitable product and without understanding how their workplace scheme is invested.  The questions within the DWP\\'s call for input cover a range of related topics including: member expectations and aspirations; information, guidance and decision-making; member communications and engagement; available products in the trust-based market; and use of investment pathways and alternative models like collective defined contribution schemes.  \"Deciding how to use your workplace pension savings is one of the most important financial decisions many people will make,\" pensions and financial inclusion minister Guy Opperman said.  \"We want to ensure the record number of Brits now saving for retirement have the support and information they need to make informed choices about accessing their hard-earned savings.\"  The government said it hoped the further research it was conducting would help it understand what support schemes currently offer to members and what they are considering offering to them in the future.  Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association director of policy and advocacy Nigel Peaple said the government\\'s call for input on existing and new solutions in the trust-based sector was a positive move.  \"We look forward to engaging further with the DWP on this topic throughout the consultation process and beyond,\" he added. \"Since the pension freedoms individuals have had more options regarding how they access their pension savings, but most people need support in making these important and complex decisions.\"  Lane Clark & Peacock partner and former pensions minister Sir Steve Webb agreed: \"A key issue is what happens at and post-retirement, and this has so far received little attention from policy makers.\"  He added: \"Most people will have modest pension pots and no access to financial advice, so they need products which will work for them without needing active engagement or investment expertise.\"  Webb explained that a \\'flex first, fix later\\' style pension could be one such product which combines \"the best of both worlds\".  \"It\\'s the flexibility and growth potential of drawdown and the certainty of a late life annuity,\" he said. \"I hope that this DWP consultation will give proper attention to what happens post-retirement, as the right strategy at retirement may not be the right strategy ten or 20 years later.\"  The consultation will run for six weeks, closing on 25 July.

The 88-year-old singer said he bought the three-bedroom condo in Westwood for about $2.55 million in 2009 and has used it as a pied-à-terre; his primary residence is in the San Fernando Valley, about a half-hour drive away.  \"The convenience was really spectacular,\" said Mr. Valli, who shot to fame in the 1960s with hits like \"Big Girls Don\\'t Cry\" and \"Walk Like a Man.\" \"To get to the airport, I just had to get on the freeway instead of leaving from the Valley. Or if I had to go into town, I could stay at the condo and leave in the morning.\"  In 2017, he began renting out the condo, asking $15,000 a month, but is now selling because it is underused and he \"doesn\\'t want to be a landlord,\" he said.  \"It\\'s a hard property to let go of. It\\'s that nice. But you can only be at one place at a time,\" said Mr. Valli. He plans to spend more time traveling than he has over the past few years, when many of his performances with the Four Seasons were canceled due to the pandemic. \"When I get home, I want to be at home.\"  The roughly 3,200-square-foot condo is on the ninth floor of the La Tour condominium, according to co-listing agent Emilio Valli of Coldwell Banker Realty, the singer\\'s son. The apartment has city and mountain views, as well as a balcony off the dining room.  Built in 1990, the building has valet parking and a heavy security presence, which is one of the reasons the elder Mr. Valli said he chose it. \"The security is the thing I was looking for,\" he said.  Frankie Valli grew up in Newark, N.J. Known for his falsetto, he had his first hit in 1962 with the Four Seasons song \"Sherry.\" The group was the subject of the Broadway show \"Jersey Boys,\" which was made into a 2014 movie starring John Lloyd Young, Christopher Walken and Vincent Piazza.

Here\\'s what you need to know  Bulb customers have been hit by an billing error that means some direct debit payments will be taken later than usual.  The issue affects a \"small number\" of households who were meant to have a direct debit taken by the energy provider on June 1.  These customers will instead have their payments taken on a later date in June.  Bulb, who has around one million customers, has been emailing everyone who is affected with details of the date when their money will be taken.  You won\\'t need to do anything, as the money should be taken automatically.  Have you received an email from Bulb saying your payment is being taken at a later date Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  The energy firm blamed the fault on a \"technical outage\" with its direct debit provider, according to MoneySavingExpert.  An email sent to some households reads: \"We usually take your energy payments on the 1st of the month.  \"Unfortunately, a technical hitch has caused a delay this time.\"  It continued: \"Sorry for the extra hassle. We\\'ll be back to normal for next month.\"  If you\\'ve been affected by the issue, you\\'ll need to make sure you have enough money in your account to cover the later payment.  Or if you manually paid your bill after your direct debit failed, Bulb said you shouldn\\'t have another payment taken this month.  If another payment does mistakenly go out though, meaning you\\'ve paid the same bill twice, contact Bulb.  A spokesperson for Bulb said: \"Due to this outage a small number of DD payments for 1st June weren\\'t taken.  \"We\\'ve already begun communicating this to affected members, explaining that their payments will be taken in the coming days, giving them appropriate notice of the payments.  \"No other payments were impacted that day and members don\\'t need to take any action.\"  Bulb was put into \"special administration\" in November 2021 after admitting that it could no longer afford to keep afloat.  This process meant the firm was propped up by taxpayer cash, so it can continue to operate as a business and provide energy to its customers.  Bulb has recently reopened its energy hardship fund for customers who are struggling.  The exact help available depends on your individual circumstances, but can include a £140 grant that you don\\'t have to repay.  You may also be able to get up to £2,000 worth of debt written off.

That's especially the case as a number of menu favourites are on their way out the door in just DAYS, too.  The good news first: Anybody after a Maccies today can get £5 off their order.  The catch is that you have to spend at least £15 first though.  And it has to be on an order place through the My McDonald's app.  Savvy savers spotted the snacking deal on bargain hunting site, hotukdeals.  The same deal was running yesterday too, but it comes to an end at midnight tonight, so hungry fans will have to be quick to cash-in, with just HOURS left to redeem.  It applies to anything on the menu so long as you meet the minimum order requirement.  That £15 doesn't include delivery fees though - you have to stock up on at least £15 worth of grub to qualify for the fiver off.  It has to be an order placed through the app too - and that's free to download.  Once you open up the app, you can apply the discount via the deals page.  Then just choose whether you'd like to collect your discounted snacks via Drive-thru, click and serve, takeaway or in restaurant instead.  Importantly though, you can only use the deal one time, so you'll have to tot up your basket carefully.  When you do so, you might want to take your pick of the four items that are in fact LEAVING Maccies' menu this week.  McDonald's launched a major menu change with all new items entering the line-up at the end of April.  Sadly their time is coming to an end, which means fans don't have long to get a last taste.  Products like the popular McSpicy chicken burger, and the Grand Big Mac will only be available to buy until June 7.  We'll also see the Flake McFlurry and its raspberry twin disappear from the range too.  But not all is lost, as the fast-food giant will be sure to plug the gap with more exciting products in their absence.  We don't yet know exactly what McDonald's will replace the departing menu items with, but we will update this story once we know more.  The fast food giant switches up its menus roughly every six weeks to give fans a bigger range of choice, so it won't be the end of shake-ups like this either.

       " 'In2ition Realty Homes First-time buyers get a boost I hear it all the time - how can first-time buyers possibly get into the home ownership market with prices the way they are? In fact, first-time purchasers continue to find ways, and the recent Federal Budget 2022 has kicked in some perks to help make it even more possible. Potential purchasers now have a Tax-Free First Homes Savings account that enables them to save up to $40,000 toward a down payment. That\\'s on top of the Government of Canada\\'s Home Buyer Plan, which allows them to use up to $35,000 from their RRSPs.  The First-Time Home Buyers\\'Tax Credit has now been doubled to $10,000, which means qualified buyers who purchased homes after January 1st of this year can claim that amount on their tax returns. This will bring a rebate of up to $1,500 instead of the previous $750.  In addition, CMHC\\'s First-Time Home Buyer Incentive has been extended to 2025. This offers a great opportunity to take advantage of a shared-equity mortgage with the Government of Canada, making the down payment more attainable and lowering monthly costs.  Those who buy new may also qualify for a GST/HST New Housing Rebate to recover some of the GST or the federal part of the HST paid on their primary place of residence. In Ontario, firsttime buyers can also look into receiving a rebate on portions of their land transfer tax.  All of this adds up. If, however, buying a first home is still a financial challenge, there are other options to consider, especially while mortgage interest rates are still incredibly low. First, get yourself pre-approved for a mortgage at a financial institution.  Then if you need to find more to make your down payment, you might be able to turn to what\\'s referred to as \"the bank of mom and pop.\" This form of gifting is becoming more common.  According to a report by CIBC, about 30 per cent of first-time home buyers receive this form of financial help in 2020. We also see an increasing number of parents co-signing for their children\\'s mortgages.  Having gone through the skyrocketing interest rates during the late 1980s and early 1990s, these parents realize how important it is to get into the market now before interest rates jump more.  My main advice is do whatever you can to get yourself into the market. Buying new is ideal, as you avoid moving in and having all kinds of renovation headaches to deal with. Just ask anyone who has bought an older residence.  The new Budget helps for sure, but you can also do some creative thinking and planning to make your dream of owning a home come true.

Inflation shot up again last month as households battled against rising energy bills as the new Ofgem price cap came into effect.  The 9% rate of inflation for the 12 months to April marks one of the highest one year increases in consumer prices since records began in 1989.  The Consumer Prices Index CPI measure of inflation had stood at 7% in March, according to data from the Office for National Statistics ONS.  CPI shows how much the price of goods and services has risen or fallen over time.  For example, if something that cost £1 a year ago now costs £1.02 today, that rate of inflation would be 2%.  Inflation figures are published each month by the Office for National Statistics ONS.  But what exactly is costing us more We explain.  Six everyday things that have gone up in price  The ONS notes how the cost of energy was the largest price rise last month. It comes after the Ofgem price cap was hiked by hundreds of pounds on April 1.  For those on a variable energy bill tariff who pay by direct debit, the price cap has risen by £693 from £1,277 to £1,971.  Prepayment customers have been hit by a bigger jump, with their price cap going up by £708, from £1,309 to £2,017.  The highest prices on record for both petrol and diesel also contributed to rising inflation in April.  Here are the biggest price increases over the 12 months to April, according to the ONS:  * Natural gas -95.5%  * Electricity -53.5%  * Motor fuels -31.4%  * Furniture and maintenance -10.7%  * Restaurants and hotels -8%  * Food and non-alcoholic drinks -6.7%  ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said of the latest data: \"Inflation rose steeply in April, driven by the sharp climb in electricity and gas prices as the higher price cap came into effect.  \"Around three-quarters of the increase in the annual rate this month came from utility bills.\"  He added: \"Steep annual rises in the cost of metals, chemicals and crude oil also continued, along with higher prices for goods leaving factory gates.  \"This was driven by increases for food products, transport equipment and metals, machinery and equipment.\"  Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"Countries around the world are dealing with rising inflation.  \"Today\\'s inflation numbers are driven by the energy price cap rise in April, which in turn is driven by higher global energy prices.  \"We cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we can, and stand ready to take further action.\"',\n",
       " 'Health,News Health,medicine,Money,NHS DRUG DEAL Major change to NHS prescription charges will affect every Brit in first shake up for 12 years CHARGES for NHS prescriptions are to be frozen for the first time in 12 years to \\'put money back in people\\'s pockets\\'.  At present, Brits have to pay £9.35 for a single prescription for their medication.  The Department of Health said that charges would usually rise with inflation.  But the cost of living crisis currently facing millions has pushed the Conservatives to leave rates unchanged.  Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: \"The rise in the cost of living has been unavoidable as we face global challenges and the repercussions of Putin\\'s illegal war in Ukraine.  \"Whilst we can\\'t completely prevent these rises, where we can help we absolutely will.  \"This is why I am freezing prescription charges to help ease some of these pressures and put money back in people\\'s pockets.\"  The plan is set to save Brits up to £17 million, with single prescriptions remaining at £9.35, while a three-month prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) stays at £30.25.  Twelve-month PPCs will remain at £108.10 and can be paid for in instalments.  Many Brits are eligible for free prescriptions, including those over 60, under 16, and those 16 to 18 in full time education.  You also get your prescriptions for free if you\\'re pregnant or have a medication exemption certificate.  The freezing of prescription costs comes as Brits have been forced to make swaps and changes to their daily lives as energy bills have soared in recent months.  At the opening of parliament last week, the Government laid out that the cost of living crisis was a priority.  Ministers announced the Energy Security Bill - which would mean the energy price cap would continue beyond 2023.  Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously urged ministers to \\'get creative\\' to ease the pressure on household budgets due to soaring global prices.  Millions of women have also been struggling to get hold of their Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) due to shortages.  Women who are going through the menopause will often suffer with symptoms such as hot flushes, mood swings, vaginal dryness and night sweats.  HRT is prescribed to help alleviate these symptoms - but prescriptions are now twice as widespread as five years ago.  Brits are also dealing with a shortage of hay fever medication.  Boots and Superdrug both confirmed there is a shortage of an ingredient called chlorphenamine maleate.  It\\'s the active ingredient in hay fever remedies including Piriton, Allercalm, Allerief, Hayleve and Pollenase, and some pharmacy-branded pills.  We pay for your stories!

The space, located just 250 meters away from Harrods in Knightsbridge, central London, is barely wide enough for a car to fit in.  It is sandwiched between two thick walls and is just two metres wide by five-and-a-half-metres long.  In comparison, the average car is 1.82 metres wide.

It came with an unexpired lease of 85 years at the time of sale and is located within walking distance from Hyde Park, Oxford Street and the West End.  Another London parking space, also in Hyde Park Gardens, went on sale in 2016 for an incredible £350,000.

       " 'News PENSION PARTICIPATION GAP Around four in five employees were part of their workplace pension in 2021, but for some groups, the figure is much lower  EXPERTS are urging more people to enrol in their workplace pension scheme, as figures reveal young workers and those on lower income are still missing out. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show that threequarters (75%) of employees in the private sector were part of their workplace pension scheme in April 2021, rising to 91% of those in the public sector.  PROPORTION OF FULL-EMPLOYEES WITH PENSIONS, BY SECTOR WEEKLY EARNINGS BAND,  The gap has narrowed considerably in the past decade - in 2012, only 32% of workers in the private sector were enrolled in work pension schemes, compared to 83% in the public sector.  The increased rates of pension participation in the private sector have been driven by the government\\'s auto-enrollment policy, phased in between October 2012 and February 2018, which required employers to register eligible employees into a workplace pension.  However, despite the general trend, many private sector workers on lower incomes are still not benefitting from workplace pension schemes.  To qualify for auto-enrolment, workers have to be between 22 and state pension age, and earning at least £10,000 per year (about £192 a week) - although younger workers and those earning below the threshold can choose to opt in.  Fewer than half (43%) of employees earning £100 to £199 per week in the private sector were enrolled in a pension in 2021.  The pension participation rate increases as wages go up - 58% of those on a salary of £200 to £299 per week were enrolled, rising to 75% of employees earning £300 to £399 per week.  Meanwhile, pension enrolment also varies between different industries.  Electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning, public administration and defence, financial and insurance activities and mining and quarrying were among those with the highest levels of employee pension participation in 2021, at more than 90%.  However, in the accomodation and food industry, only 51% workers were participating in their workplace pension schemes.  This is related to the fact that the industry has one of the highest proportions of young employees as well as lower average earnings, meaning workers are less likely to meet the age and earning criteria of auto-enrolment. Helen Morrissey, senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Workplace pensions are an important way to save for your retirement as you benefit from an employer contribution as well as your own and this can make a significant benefit to how much you end up with in retirement. \"  She says auto-enrolment has seen an increasing number of people take part in work pension schemes but further reform is needed for more people to benefit.

With the rising cost of living set to continue dominating the last few weeks of the federal election campaign, new data from online financial advice service Otivo shows more than 342,000 Australian households have no financial safety net - such as savings or the ability to draw down on their mortgage - and would struggle to make it to the middle of next month if they lost their income today.  The data, which was collated in partnership with Digital Finance Analytics, was based on a survey of more than 52,000 households across the country.  It takes into account there are 9.6 million households in Australia, of which 1.47 million have potential financial issues but could solve them with more debt.  Some of the most at-risk places were Georgetown in South Australia, Parklea in NSW and Sanford in Tasmania. The Adelaide suburbs of Broadview and Greenhill were also identified as among those at peril.  Tasmanians had the shortest survival window of just 19 days, compared to Northern Territorians, who could hold out for 24 days if they did not have a financial safety net or government support.  Even with government support these households would survive between less than a week and up to three weeks.  Otivo founder and chief executive Paul Feeney said low-income areas were not the only ones feeling the pressure, with traditionally affluent suburbs of Rose Bay and Double Bay in Sydney\\'s east and South Yarra in Melbourne\\'s inner east facing survival windows of less than 13 weeks on average.  \"It\\'s about the money coming in and what is left over. The lower the gap, the higher the pressure and the higher the risk,\" Mr Feeney said.  \"For about 6 per cent of Australian households, the only way they could handle losing their income would be to take out another mortgage, which will only increase their weekly expenses.  \"This is just covering the basics such as the mortgage and keeping the lights on. If you include fun money that number (time-frame) comes down dramatically.\" Cost-of-living pressures have dominated the campaign to date, with higher-than-expected inflation figures triggering a possible interest rate rise next week.  Australian Council of Social Service chief executive Dr Cassandra Goldie said people\\'s levels of anxiety and stress were worsening, with many living in a daily fear of not being able to meet their financial needs.  \"We should not ignore the disturbing fact that Australia has one of the highest levels of household indebtedness in the world,\" she said.  \"... They look like they\\'re doing OK but they know that if their income stops very quickly, the house of cards will fall.\" Dr Goldie is urging all parties and candidates to increase income support such as JobSeeker, and improve access to affordable social housing.',\n",

The terraced property in Barnoldswick, Lincolnshire has a huge amount of space for the ultra-low price, covering 1,077 square feet.  It boasts two reception rooms and a kitchen on the ground floor, as well as a bedroom and shower room on the first floor.  But sharp-eyed property fans will quickly notice a very bizarre design flaw.  The bathroom appears to have been built inside a bedroom, rather than a specifically-designed cubicle.  The room is 14ft by 13ft, meaning the shower, toilet and sink are completely dwarfed by the space.  It\\'s also been carpeted, while walls are covered with floral pink wallpaper - an unusual choice in a bathroom.  There is at least 10ft of space between the toilet and the white corner shower.  It\\'s likely the room was never designed for its purpose in the first place. The toilet facilities may originally have been built into an outhouse behind the property.  However, with some renovations the home will likely be a top investment.  Despite only having one designated bedroom, there\\'s an attic upstairs, giving the new owner an opportunity to rework the space.  The property will go under the hammer in May.  Auctioneers Allsop say the home can be found in York Street.  \"The shops and amenities of Barnoldswick Town Square are to the north and Colne Rail station is approximately 5.7 miles to the south,\" they say.  \"The A56 is to the south east and the A59 is to the north west with Letcliffe Park is to the south.\"  FRIGHTMOVE  Social media users were left stunned by the layout of the room with the toilet.  One said: \"I have no words.\"  Another wrote: \"Nice bit of legroom.\"  A third commented: \"Could turn into a lovely en-suite.\"  A fourth added: \"F*** me, for thirty large I\\'d have it.\"  It\\'s not the only property with an unwelcome surprise in store on the market.  \\'NO WORDS\\'  A whopping seven-bed pad with two hot tubs is available in County Clare, Ireland for ?130,000 - but it needs a complete refurb.

Warren & Lois McClure Foundation announced the \"Free Degree Promise through the Early College Program at CCV\" on Tuesday for Vermont students in the high school classes of 2022-2026.  In addition to providing tuition and fees after any federal and state financial aid, the foundation will provide career and education counseling and stipends to help pay for books, transportation and other college costs.  The McClure foundation\\'s plan builds upon the Community College of Vermont\\'s Early College program that allows high school seniors to complete their last year of high school and first year of college at the same time.  \"Young people deserve a degree they can count on and afford,\" McClure Foundation President Barbara Benedict said in a statement. \"By guaranteeing this pathway through Early College to a free degree at CCV, we are telling Vermont\\'s young people we believe in them and we believe in their futures.\"  Vermont officials have been working for years to help alleviate what has become an acute labor shortage caused by declines in the number of working age adults and the lack of trained workers.  There are programs in other states to help pay for community college. In Maine, the state budget passed earlier this month included $20 million to fund two years of free community college for eligible graduating high school students between 2020 and 2023.  Currently about 150 seniors from about 50 high schools in the state participate in the Community College of Vermont\\'s Early College program, said CCV spokeswoman Katie Keszey.  McClure Foundation Executive Director Carolyn Weir said they don\\'t know how many Vermont students will take advantage of their offer to help students earn associate degrees.  \"We\\'re committed to covering costs no matter how many students enroll,\" Weir said in an email. \"If a lot of students enroll, and we can point to an improvement in the number of young people in Vermont from low-income and historically marginalized backgrounds benefiting from college and career training, we\\'ll consider that a success - for enrolled students and for Vermont.\"  The McClure Foundation focuses its efforts on equitable access to postsecondary and career education. The foundation says that since 2008 it has awarded more than $5 million to help Vermonters prepare \"for secure and successful employment.\"  \"Early College in and of itself can be really beneficial, and taking that a step further and allowing people to finish a degree would be really, really helpful for some people,\" OJ Daring, who is participating in the Early Program at CCV\\'s Winooski, said in a statement announcing the program. \"To get those two years, and not be in debt, and get farther ? it opens a lot of doors and opportunities if (students) are able to get an associate degree.\"',\n",

Are you worried about affording your energy bills this year Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  Joanna Flowers, engineer at British Gas said: \"You can save on average £40 a year on your electricity bill by line drying clothes instead of using a tumble dryer during the summer.\"  British Gas also estimates that running your washing machine on a 30° cycle instead of using higher temperatures can save around £28 on your annual bill.  \"There are several things you can do to be more energy efficient with the washing machine,\" said Ms Flowers.  \"Use the economy settings to save water and energy and drying your clothes outside as much as you can when the weather allows.  \"In the winter, you should also avoid drying clothes on radiators as much as you can as it will make your boiler work harder to heat the room.\"  For other ways to lower your bills, The Mirror has looked at whether it is cheaper to have a shower or bath and whether you\\'re better off using an electric heater or gas radiators.  We\\'ve also highlighted a simple fridge freezer mistake that could be pushing up your energy bills.  And here is whether you\\'re better off using a microwave or regular oven when cooking, to keep your costs down.  When it comes to the best way to use your kettle, you should only fill it up with as much water as you need.  Many of us are guilty of not sticking to this rule -and it could be adding £87 to your energy bill.',\n",
       " 'Millennials and baby boomers are saving - just not for retirement With COVID forcing many of us to live in the present, it\\'s no surprise future plans are taking a back seat.  That goes for savings, too: just 5% of millennials and 13% of baby boomers are prioritizing their retirement savings, according to a recent survey by Time2play. Additionally, 44% of millennials and a third of baby boomers have no retirement savings at all.  These attitudes may point to a lack of personalized education when it comes to money and savings, says Deb Boyden, head of U.S. defined contribution at asset management firm Schroders.  \"The retirement industry needs to think differently about how they reach investors that have the mindset of living in the moment,\" Boyden says. \"They need help translating their savings today into what that means for the future.\"  The survey found that millennials and baby boomers do want to save, but it\\'s to cover immediate financial needs: 53% of millennials and 61% of baby boomers say an emergency fund is the most important thing they can save for. And when it comes to spending, both groups were prioritizing spending money on travel, home improvement projects and self-care items like clothes and makeup.  Read more: Millennials save for retirement years earlier than boomers - because they have to  Boyden says employees may need help visualizing what their money can buy them in retirement, so it\\'s less of a lump sum and more of a \"real life scenario.\" That can be applied not just to savings, but how employees invest, too.  \"Personalized investing helps people see, if they invest in this, what that means for them in retirement,\" Boyden says. \"This helps them see what not investing means for their retirement.\"  The Time2play survey revealed that both groups are savings-minded: half of millennials began saving at 17-years-old or younger, whereas almost a quarter of baby boomers waited until their 30s. However, 95% of millennials and 90% of baby boomers wish they had more saved.  Employers can step in and provide personal finance education around budgeting, both for the short- and long-term. Ninety percent of employees believe employer-provided financial benefits would help them feel more invested at work, according to a survey from Morgan Stanley at Work. Seventy-nine percent of HR leaders believe employees will quit without financial wellness offerings, the Morgan Stanley report found.  Read more: Employees want financial wellness more than they want PTO  To prevent employees from falling victim to that \"live in the now\" attitude, Boyden says it\\'s all about balance. Understanding how today\\'s decisions can impact what happens decades from now may be hard to picture, but important if employees want to reach the financial finish line.  \"We have to think about how to communicate with these different demographics in the workplace,\" Boyden says. \"Savings doesn\\'t have to be all or nothing - making some mental adjustments can have a profound impact on your retirement savings.\"',\n",
       " 'Money,News Money,Home Insurance,Money saving tips CASH GRANT Thousands could get £10k FREE for major new home improvements - check if you\\'re eligible HOMEOWNERS in areas prone to flooding could get free cash worth thousands of pounds to improve their properties.  The extra help is available via a new scheme, which is designed to help with repairs that protect properties from flooding in future.  People will be able to get up to £10,000 free cash through their insurer to help make their homes more resilient against flooding.  The cash can be used for things like moving plug sockets and white goods higher.  It means that during a flood these essentials are above the water levels, reducing the impact and letting families return to homes sooner.  Waterproof tiling and extra door seals are also among the home improvements that could be made to make it easier to recover after water damage.  Flood damage can be costly and run into the thousands of pounds for repairs, so improvements could also help cut down on the future cost of repairs for homeowners.  The grant is on top of an insurer\\'s usual payout that would cover the cost of repairs and losses as a result of flooding.  The Build Back Better scheme is a partnership between the government\\'s Flood Re and insurers.  Flood Re allows people in areas with a high risk of flooding access to affordable home insurance.  Five insurers have so far joined Build Back Better, but more are expected to follow.  They are:  * Ageas  * Aviva  * Lloyds Banking  * LV= General Insurance  * NFU Mutual  Jon Bird, property claims manager at NFU Mutual, said that there has been a trend towards wetter summers and winters in recent years, with one in four homes now at risk of flooding.  He said: \"With at-risk properties often being hit again and again, higher flood risk threatens to cost homeowners a lot of money and stress.\"  To access the cash you\\'ll need to have insurance with one of these providers through Flood Re.  You can check if your property is at risk of flooding and eligible for Flood Re using this online tool and searching your postcode.  There are many more insurers which offer Flood Re policies, but only the above area part of Build Back Better.  You\\'ll still want to check that any policy you get for home insurance suits your needs - check out our guide for getting the best deal.  The cash available for improvements will depend on your needs and the work that needs doing, but is worth a maximum of £10,000.  If you\\'re eligible, the cash is available when making repairs after flooding, and you\\'ll need to go through your insurer directly.

       " 'MONEY Americans leaning on credit cards more often Inflation in the U.S. is more than three times higher than it was last year, straining Americans\\' finances.  Without stimulus checks and a lapse in monthly Child Tax Credit payments, Americans in dire financial circumstances are swiping credit cards more frequently compared to a year ago. But they continue to hold back from dipping into savings and retirement accounts relative to last year.  Some 13% of U.S. households found it very difficult to pay for their usual expenses from March 30 to April 10, according to data from the Census Bureau\\'s Household Pulse Survey. Within that cohort, 44% of respondents said they\\'re using credit cards or loans to meet needs, while 34% said they\\'re using money from savings or retirement accounts.  Last year when inflation was rising at a 2.6% annual rate, some 9% of households surveyed then found it very difficult to pay for usual expenses, according to data from a prior Household Pulse Survey. That survey also found that 34% of households used credit cards or loans to meet spending needs and 31% dipped into savings.  \"Even in the face of inflation, if you have steady cash flow coming in, there may be less need or inclination to withdraw from savings,\" said Mark Schrader, a financial planning strategist at the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America. The U.S. unemployment rate is just a 10th of a percentage point above the pre-pandemic level and average hourly earnings are up more than 5% compared to last year, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Indeed regardless of financial circumstances, the majority of American households are using \"regular income sources\" to pay for everyday expenses, according to Census data.  Paying off credit card debt  will be more expensive  But in the face of more interest rate hikes this year, Americans may want to think twice about turning to their credit cards. Compared with last year, credit card debt has gone up 16% among 64 million Credit Karma members. The average amount of debt they currently hold is $5,221, up from $4,896 in April 2021.  When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, which it plans to do six more times this year, the interest you\\'ll have to pay on credit card debt also rises. Average credit card rates currently hover at 16.36%, according to data from CreditCards.com. Rates began rising after the Fed raised its key interest rate in March for the first time since 2018.  That\\'s why Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst for CreditCards.com and Bankrate.com., recommends people use most of their tax refund money to pay off credit card debt.  But if you don\\'t have ample emergency savings it\\'s best to prioritize building it up over paying off credit card debt so you don\\'t \"find yourself in a position where you\\'re robbing Peter to pay Paul,\" Rossman previously told USA TODAY.',\n",

Over 800 issues have been logged so far on analytics website Downdetector.  It comes just after Nationwide also suffered a major outage a few days ago, disrupting customers payments and more.  This time HSBC customers are experiencing problems as online banking, mobile banking and the simple matter of logging into accounts all goes awry.  Problems appear to have started at around 7.30am, though a spike of some 80 reports were logged at 11pm last night too.  Over half of frustrated HSBC users can\\'t access mobile banking at all which means they can\\'t track payments or access their funds without visiting a physical branch for the time being.  Customers aired their complaints on Twitter.  One said: \"Haven\\'t been able to log on this morning.\"  While another said: \"I can\\'t log in to my Business Internet Banking today, \\'Something went wrong\\' it says.\"  A third said: \"I can\\'t get on desktop or the mobile app.\"  \"Many issues recently, which is disappointing,\" said another.  It wouldn\\'t be the first time customers of the bank have been left in the dark as services go down.  HSBC users struggled to use the its app and make payments just this month.  And HSBC customers once again had trouble logging into their mobile banking to access accounts and pay bills following IT problems at the bank that occurred last month.  It also upset customers in March when it announced plans to close a further 69 bank branches across the UK.  HSBC has been contacted for comment.  Whether you get any money for the inconvenience is another matter.  Can I claim compensation for an online banking outage?  There\\'s not automatic right to compensation like there is with other services, such as telecoms for example.  You can make a complaint to your bank if you think you\\'re owed money because of an outage, for instance if you couldn\\'t pay a bill on time and were charged a fee as a result.  Each bank has its own complaints procedure and you\\'ll need to show evidence of how the tech issues affected you.  You can then complain to HSBC, either in your local branch, or by using this complaints form.  You will need to think about how much you expect in compensation, and when you expect to receive it.

Cops found the body of Shandle Marie Riley, 42, at a home in Soddy-Daisy, Tennessee on April 13.  Riley\\'s cause of death remains unknown at this time as officials at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation are awaiting autopsy results.  It\\'s not currently known if foul play was involved in her death, WTVC reported.  She accused Hamilton County Deputies Daniel Wilkey and Jacob Goforth of baptizing her after a traffic stop in February 2019.  Court documents from the time claim that Wilkey pulled Riley\\'s car over in the driveway of her friend\\'s home.  Riley said she had been to a gas station and bought cigarettes and fuel.  The officer reportedly believed that she was in possession of methamphetamine.  The lawsuit alleged Wilkey searched Riley \"unlawfully\" after he instructed her to get out of her car.  Wilkey quizzed Riley, asking if she had anything illegal in her vehicle to which she replied a marijuana \"roach\".  It was apparently hiding in a pack of cigarettes and she handed them to the officer, court documents say.  Wilkey apparently asked Riley if she believed in Jesus.  The lawsuit claimed Wilkey told Riley \"God was talking to him during the vehicle search and [he] felt the Lord wanted him to baptize the plaintiff.\"  He apparently \"felt the spirit at the time\", according to the lawsuit.  Riley was reportedly told she would be issued a criminal citation for marijuana possession, rather than being sent to jail.  Legal documents say that Riley ordered to get towels that would be used for the so-called baptism and was instructed to follow Wilkey in his car.  The pair were joined by Goforth in Soddy Lake.  Wilkey allegedly told Riley that a witness was needed so the baptism could be legitimized.  Riley alleged that she felt \"violated\", court documents claimed.  Wilkey admitted baptizing a woman he arrested in February 2019, court filings obtained by WTVC.  He claimed she asked him to do it as a way of \"turning her life away from drug abuse and crime\".  In his ruling, Judge Travis McDonough said: \"There is no indication in the record that either officer understood or intended the baptism as anything but an exercise of faith and religion.  \"Any reasonable observer would conclude that the effort of the baptism was an unequivocal endorsement of Christianity.\"  Meanwhile, Riley pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a controlled substance.  She was given a suspended sentence and probation.  We pay for your stories!  Do you have a story for The US Sun team?  Email us at exclusive@the-sun.com or call 212 416 4552.

As part of his change of plea, from about 2012, and continuing to 2020, Nino, a resident of Broward County, was a financial advisor working at a branch office of UBS Financial Services Inc. in Miami. Nino oversaw and managed UBS investment accounts for various customers, including three victims who were related and who had various investment accounts at UBS. Nino was the financial advisor assigned to oversee and manage the victims' money in the accounts.  From about May 2014 to February 2020, Nino made a total of 62 unauthorized transfers from three UBS accounts belonging to the victims, which totaled $5,833,218.59. To accomplish the wire fraud scheme, Nino made materially false and fraudulent statements to his victims and concealed and omitted material facts including misrepresenting the true performance, balance, and rate of return of the accounts he managed; forging the signature of his clients on documents purporting to authorize transfers out of the accounts; preparing a fraudulent land purchase contract and forging a victim's signature on the land purchase contract to make it appear that the victim was purchasing land in Colombia by using money from the victim's account; removing one of the victim's email from the victim's UBS email account profile so that the victim would not receive email notifications from UBS about unauthorized transfers; and preparing fraudulent UBS account statements and client review statements, which falsely inflated the balance and value of the victims' accounts.  Nino is scheduled for sentencing on June 21, 2022, before U.S. District Judge Donald L. Graham. He faces up to 60 years imprisonment.  Juan Antonio Gonzalez, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge, FBI Miami, made the announcement.  FBI Miami investigated the case.

This is according to retail analysts at Peel Hunt, who predict food inflation could top 10% this year.  Data from Kantar showed grocery prices were up 5.2% in March with cost increases already hitting consumers.  Producer prices for cupboard staples such as milk, barley and pork were up by a fifth by the end of March.  The cost of wheat and cooking oil has also soared because of the war in Ukraine -but experts say further hikes are on the way.  Butter could rocket by 60% by the end of the year, they said.  \"The 30-year improvement in living standards due to stable and reducing food prices is reversing,\" said Charles Hall of Peel Hunt.  \"Food inflation increased 5.2% in March but will rise sharply as the impact of the war is felt.\"  Mr Hall added: \"It may be painful in the UK, but that\\'s nothing compared to the increase in the cost of living in a number of countries, particularly those with a high level of imports from Russia and Ukraine.\"  How do you save money in the supermarkets Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  Lindsay Boswell, of food charity FareShare, said: \"Many families are now experiencing added hardship.  \"We\\'re calling for more support for those struggling to feed themselves, and more donations of food from across the food industry.\"  The Peel Hunt report also found palm oil prices are up 75% and coconut oil 30%.  Cotton prices have risen 130% year-on-year.  Fuel, energy and travel bills have also been rising steadily in recent months.  The rate of Consumer Prices Index CPI inflation was today confirmed to have hit a fresh 30-year high in March, reaching 7% and up from 6.2% in February.  It was once more the highest point since March 1992, when inflation stood at 7.1%.  The rise was higher than the 6.7% that analysts had expected and was driven by fuel, restaurant and food prices.  But the increase does not take into account the average 54% increase in energy bills that was applied to around 22 million households two weeks ago.  This will not appear in inflation figures until next month.  The April data is expected to show another jump in inflation and demonstrate the increased squeeze on ordinary people.  The Bank of England has predicted that inflation could peak at around 8% in April once the energy price cap increase is factored in.

Software boss Chris Hoyle and his wife Elaine had submitted plans to build a whopping modern mansion on the edge of Beaulieu River in the New Forest.  But official data suggests the Hampshire river, where Lord Nelson\\'s favourite ship was built, boasts some of the darkest skies in Britain.  In addition, it has the \"highest status of protection\" as it sits inside a national park.  Under the Hoyles\\' plans, the two-storey property would have had a glazed atrium and a \"very large\" number of artificial external lights.  Locals immediately launched a vehement fightback, with furious sailors warning they\\'d be dazzled by the beams.  And an inspector has now sided with neighbours and thrown out the application because of the \"sheer amount of lighting\".  The official said it risks \"eroding rural darkness and tranquillity\" in the celebrated beauty spot.  The Hoyles sold off their driving simulation software business in a £23million deal back in 2019. They then bought an existing property on a 1.6 acre plot.  However, the couple said the 1960s riverside home wasn\\'t big enough, and submitted plans to tear it down and replace it with a new build.  The property would have had three wings, an atrium and outbuildings.  Those to object included Beaulieu River Sailing Club\\'s commodore, Mary Montagu-Scott, who warned the home would be a \"safety hazard\".  \"The darkness is absolutely critical to night vision for sailors who come up the river at night,\" she said.  \"My interest is in protecting the nature, ambience and character of the Beaulieu River for future generations and protect the safety of the navigation for yachtsmen.\"  She said the house has an \"unusual modern design\" and will \"stand out\".  Lord Strathcarron, a mooring holder on the river, said: \"Although I appreciate it will give the new owners the most wonderful view, the cost will be ruining the view of everybody else.\"  The Hoyles have had two applications refused, but took their latest application to an appeal committee.  However, it\\'s been thrown out altogether.  FRIGHTMOVE  A report by the inspector reveals the site has a \"notably verdant and tranquil character\" and \"lies within one of the darkest locations, according to dark skies mapping information\".  The property would stand out against the \"wider landscape\", the inspector concluded.  \"The site is located at a particularly prominent position along the river, close to a sharp bend,\" the report said.  \"It is clearly visible in views from the river.\"  Mr Hoyle, an IT expert, founded driving simulation software rFpro in 2007. It is now used by racing teams in F1 and motorsport.  The business in Romsey, Hampshire, was bought out by AB Dynamics in 2019.',\n",

This means you shouldn\\'t need to apply, as your council will have you bank account details on file.  If you don\\'t apply by direct debit, then you\\'ll need to manually apply for the rebate through your local authority.  Your council should contact you with more information in April, if you\\'re eligible.  \"If you pay your council tax by direct debit, then you will get the money automatically paid into your bank, it\\'s really simple,\" Martin said on ITV\\'s Good Morning Britain this week.  \"If you don\\'t pay by direct debit, then the council will get in contact with you to tell you how to claim the cash.  \"If you don\\'t do that then they will give it to you as an energy rebate.

If you\\'re eligible, the money won\\'t need to be paid back.  For those who are struggling but aren\\'t eligible for the council tax rebate, a £144 million funding pot is being set up to support vulnerable people and poorer people.  This is being designed to help those who do not pay council tax in England, or that pay council tax for properties in Bands E, F, G and H.  At the time of the council tax help being confirmed, it was announced that governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will receive around £565million of Barnett funding to help those not covered by council tax grants.  You can check what other council tax help you may be eligible for here.  Other support announced to help rising energy bills includes a £200 upfront discount on your gas and electricity.  Energy suppliers will be loaned the money to do this by the government, and should apply the discount from October.

The Starter-K Act of 2022 creates starter retirement plans that streamline regulations and lower costs for small businesses and start-ups, resulting in more access to easy retirement savings. Employees of participating small businesses are automatically enrolled, meaning easier retirement savings up to $6,000 per year.\"Small businesses are the backbone of our economy, providing millions of jobs for Americans nationwide. But far too often, businesses cannot afford to provide their workers with retirement plans, leaving many Americans without a sound financial future,\" said Senator Carper. \"I\\'m proud to cosponsor this legislation that would make it simpler and more cost effective for small businesses to provide workers with employer-sponsored retirement plans. I look forward to working with Senator Barrasso on this important issue to help more Americans save for retirement and achieve more secure financial futures.\"\"Small businesses are the biggest employers in so many communities in Wyoming and around the country. They deserve the opportunity to provide their employees with better options to save more for retirement,\" said Senator Barrasso. \"Our bipartisan bill ensures that small businesses can access streamlined plans without complex regulations. This will help more hard-working Americans save money and achieve a more secure financial future.\" \"The nation\\'s retirement savings gap is almost exclusively found among small businesses, many of which cite administrative concerns and cost as primary reasons they don\\'t offer currently access to a retirement savings plan at work,\" said Brian Graff, CEO of the American Retirement Association. \"As they look to meet the challenges of the \\'Great Resignation,\\' the \\'Starter K\\' provides both a simplified structure and real tax incentives for hundreds of thousands of small businesses to provide for the first time this option to their workforce.

The credit card company has millions of customers in the UK, and the crash has left some people unable to access their accounts and make a payment.  Over 150 customers have complained on outage service Downdector, with issues starting from 8:15am this morning.  Of complaints raised, 91% were in regards to login issues, 6% had problems making payments, and 2% had trouble using the app.  The area most affected appears to be London, with other places like Brighton, Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester, Nottingham and Norwaich affected too.  Customers are complaining on Twitter about being unable to log into accounts.  No data found  One customer said: \"Hi @Barclaycard can you fix your app.\"  While another said: \"Unable to log in this morning.\"  Another customer vented: \"Still can\\'t log on this morning. Extremely frustrating.\"  Barclaycard\\'s customer service account on Twitter has been replying to some customers experiencing problems.  It tweeted to one customer: \"We are aware of the issues at the moment and are working to fix this as quickly as possible.\"  The Sun has contacted Barclaycard for a comment.  Barclaycard customers aren\\'t the only ones who have experienced service crashes when trying to use online banking services recently.  Over the weekend, Halifax and Lloyds customers couldn\\'t access their accounts on Sunday morning.  The tech problem affected customers of Halifax, Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland across the country and started at around 10.30am.  While Tesco Bank went down last week, locking hundreds out of their accounts too.  Customers said they were unable to view their credit card accounts - Tesco Bank no longer offers current accounts after closing them last year.  Can I get compensation for a bank outage?  Unlike telecoms companies, banks do not have a fixed compensation scheme for service disruption, although depending on how much it has affected you, you may be entitled to some money back.  It is worth gathering evidence of your problems so you can make a formal complaint to Barclaycard directly.  Try to make a note of when you were unable to access the website or app, plus any costs you incurred as a result.  If your credit rating has been affected by a service outage, because you got a late payment fee after being unable to make a transaction, for example, you should also keep a record of this.  If you spoke to anyone to try and resolve the problem, make a note of their name and when you spoke to them, as well as roughly what you discussed and what they advised you to do.

       " 'News ALP eyes regional first home buyers From Page 1 \"Labor\\'s regional first-time buyer scheme is reserved just for people who live in the regions and to access the scheme you\\'ll have to have lived in the region for the last 12 months.\"  Under the scheme, first home buyers can buy property with a deposit of just 5 per cent instead of the usual standard of around 20 per cent. The government would guarantee the additional amount needed to reach the 20 per cent threshold, thus allowing borrowers to avoid paying thousands of dollars in lender\\'s mortgage insurance.  With the government providing a guarantee of up to 15 per cent of the value of the property purchased, that\\'s a saving of up to $32,000 for a property in the Illawarra, Central Coast and Hunter regions.  The big question is are there houses available for first home buyers under the scheme? Supply is widely acknowledged as one of the most pressing housing issues. There are local price caps for properties which rise to $800,000 for the houses in the Illawarra, Central Coast and Hunter regions, come in at $400,000 in Tasmania and $500,000 for regional Victorian houses, although Geelong is listed at $700,000.  In recognition of rising house prices, Labor is pledging to review and update the scheme\\'s price caps every six months, rather than yearly, under the current scheme.  \"If the price caps need to be adjusted and raised to make sure that they can get their first home then we\\'ll do it,\" Mr Clare said.  And if house prices fall as touted by the major banks what would happen to the first home buyers? Could they be in a worse financial position? An expected 2023 price reversal in the housing market of more than 10 per cent could see Australians using lending schemes lose value in their homes.  \"What\\'s important here whether people are accessing this scheme or not is that they can afford to get the loan and repay it in circumstances where interest rates return to normal levels,\" Mr Clare said.  \"And interest rates won\\'t stay at emergency levels forever. That\\'s why the rules that have been put in place by APRA to make sure that the banks are only lending to people who can afford to repay the loan at current interest rates but also when interest rates return to normal levels are so important.\"  The government body that runs the current scheme, the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, would set the boundaries for capital cities and for larger and smaller regions.  To be eligible, the first home buyer would also have to be over 18, live in the house purchased and have a taxable income of up to $125,000 per year for singles and $200,000 a year for couples.  The ALP last year released its $10 billion pledge for a Housing Australia Future Fund to build 30,000 low-cost houses.',\n",
       " 'Spring Statement 2022: Chancellor rejects calls to delay National Insurance increase Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, has confirmed that National Insurance (NI) contribution increases will go ahead as planned from April next year, but announces a lift in the threshold to £3,000.  In the Spring Statement, Sunak said the \"difficult but responsible decision\" to raise NI contributions was to help support social care and NHS funds.  However, to help shoulder the new levy and tackle the cost-of-living crisis currently sweeping the UK, the Chancellor has raised the NI threshold for the amount earned before incurring a tax to £12,570, a £3000 increase, which will come into effect in July 2022.  \"That\\'s a £6 billion personal tax cut for 30 million people across the UK, a tax cut for employees worth over £330 a year,\" Sunak noted.  However, with inflation hitting a 30-year high at 6.2% in February, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned that it could continue to rise, reaching 7.4% by the end of the year.  The NI insurance increase, announced in September last year, has already prompted a response from insurers such as Legal & General and Aviva,  which have both amended its group income protection policies respectively to automatically consider the changes and help support employers with the additional costs.  Commenting on the Spring Statement announcement, Shaun Moore, tax and financial planning expert at Quilter, said that today\\'s announcement was a \"U-turn in all but name.\"  \"The increase in the primary threshold will mean that roughly 70% of national insurance payers will pay less NICs in 2022/23 than they did in 2021/22, according to the government\\'s own calculations,\" Moore said.  \"Anyone earning below £34,300 will now face a lower national insurance bill in 2022/23 than they currently face in this tax year. Anyone earning above this amount will still have a higher national insurance bill.\"  However, Carter warned that the move will create \"administrative problems\" for employers, who will \"have to start the tax year with one set of assumptions for national insurance calculations, to then have to change them from July.\"  Helen Morrissey, senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"The Chancellor has been steadfast in his determination to implement the Health and Social Care levy, but his actions today have at least helped lower earners by raising the threshold at which they would have to start paying it. These actions will put some money back in their pockets at a time when costs are on the rise.  However, by lifting the threshold, care must be taken that workers earning less than £12,570 per year do not lose access to vital National Insurance credits for state pension. The state pension forms the backbone of most people\\'s retirement and therefore, they should ensure they do not incur gaps unnecessarily, that mean they end up with less in retirement.\"  To view photo, click here.',\n",

The cash boost will go to more than 57,000 carers as part of a £29million package announced by the Welsh Government.  Announcing the plans on Wednesday, deputy minister for social services Julie Morgan said she hoped the payment would \"show how much we value and appreciate what they do\".  \"Unpaid carers have played a pivotal role throughout the pandemic and we recognise the financial and emotional hardships they have experienced,\" she said.  \"I hope this £500 payment will go some way to supporting them during these difficult times.\"  Anyone receiving Thousands of carers missing out on £244 a year -how to make sure you claim it on March 31 will be eligible to claim from the fund later this year.  Carers allowance is paid to people who care for someone receiving certain benefits for at least 35 hours a week, while earning no more than £128 a week.  Ms Morgan added: \"We understand not all unpaid carers will be eligible for this payment, as many are not in receipt of a carer\\'s allowance, and we will continue supporting carers of all ages in every way we can.\"  The scheme is being launched after a survey of more than 1,500 unpaid carers found nearly half had to use their personal savings and give up work or study to care, while more than half had to give up on hobbies or personal interests because of their caring role, the Government said.  It is also recognised that unpaid carers will be exposed to greater financial pressures than others, due to caring for people with complex needs combined with the current cost-of-living crisis.  Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show 57,130 people are in receipt of carers allowance in Wales.  The highest rate of unpaid carers are in Neath Port Talbot, where 267 out of every 10,000 people are receiving carers allowance.  Monmouthshire has the lowest rate of unpaid carers, with 112 out of every 10,000 in receipt of the benefit.  Carers Wales director Claire Morgan praised the Government and called it \"an important first step in actively recognising carers\\' daily contribution to our society\".  Simon Hatch, director of Carers Trust Wales, said: \"Unpaid carers have been on the front line throughout the pandemic and this payment is recognition of the many hours of care they\\'ve given alongside the efforts of the paid workforce.  \"This is a first step towards addressing some of the concerns we\\'ve heard from unpaid carers across Wales, spanning from before the pandemic, about their daily struggles to make ends meet.\"',\n",
       " 'COURT IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON CREDIT REPAIR COMPANY TO PROTECT CONSUMERS WASHINGTON, March 21 -- The U.S. Department of Justice\\'s Civil Division issued the following press release:  The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced that a federal court in Houston, Texas, entered a permanent injunction barring a credit repair company and its CEO from representing that it can repair or improve consumers\\' credit scores. The court also entered a preliminary injunction that prohibits the defendants from making large or non-essential expenditures to preserve assets for consumer redress.  In a civil complaint filed March 1 and unsealed on March 14, the Department of Justice alleged that that Alexander V. Miller, 42, of Missouri City, Texas, and his company Turbo Solutions Inc. violated the Credit Repair Organizations Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the FTC Act and the FTC\\'s Telemarketing Sales Rule in connections with defendants\\' marketing and sales of credit repair services. On March 4, the court issued a temporary restraining order imposing financial restrictions on defendants, which remained in place through the resolution of the preliminary injunction hearing.  The complaint alleges that the defendants used internet websites and telemarketing to falsely claim that the defendants could improve consumers\\' credit scores by removing all negative items from consumers\\' credit reports. According to the complaint, the defendants also filed or caused to be filed fake identity theft reports with the FTC. The complaint further alleges that the defendants routinely took prohibited advanced fees for their credit repair services and did not make required disclosures regarding those services. Many consumers allegedly paid defendants a fee ranging from several hundred dollars to $1,500, but did not receive the higher credit scores defendants promised.  \"Credit repair scams affect consumers who already are suffering from low credit scores,\" said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M.

A NEW disability payment has opened for applications from Scots living in some areas - and you could be eligible to receive £150 a week.  People who live in Dundee City, Perth and Kinross and Western Isles council areas can now apply for the Adult Disability Payment.  It will be administered through Social Security Scotland and will replace the Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which is delivered by the UK Government.  It will be open to people aged between 16 and state pension age, and who are disabled, have a long-term health condition or a terminal illness.  Dundee City, Perth and Kinross and Western Isles council areas will take part in the initial pilot scheme and further council areas will be introduced in phases until the benefit is rolled out nationwide on August 29.

The payment is made up of two parts: daily living and mobility.  You may qualify for one or both parts.  You may qualify for the daily living part if you need help with things like preparing food, taking nutrition (eating and drinking), managing therapy or monitoring a health condition and washing and bathing.

       " 'Money \\'Pensioner poverty\\' alarm as older people raid pension pots Growing signs that people are using cash intended for retirement to get through UK\\'s cost-of-living crisis  Older people face the prospect of \"pensioner poverty\" due to the rising cost of living and the falling value of the stock market, it has been claimed.  Figures from online investment platform Interactive Investor show its customers withdrew a quarter more from their private pensions in January as the cost of energy, food and petrol went up.  The figures have prompted concern that pensioners will not have enough money to see them through retirement.  In January, the average withdrawal from an Interactive Investor pension was £1,944, up 25% on the average for the same month in previous years. In February, the average was £1,910, up 7% on the same month in previous years.  Former pensions minister and campaigner Ros Altmann says these higher withdrawals are a \"danger signal for the future\", particularly if they are taking their retirement savings early. \"As the cost of basic essentials, such as food and heating have soared, people need higher incomes to cover their bills. Pay increases are far lower than current 30-year record high inflation rates, and people may be searching for other ways to make ends meet,\" she says.  \"For the over-55s, this could mean being tempted to take more money from their pension funds. This is worrying because private pensions are meant to support people after they finish work, rather than topping up pre-retirement earnings.  \"Higher pension withdrawals now risks rising pensioner poverty in future and lower long-term growth.\"  Becky O\\'Connor, head of pensions at Interactive Investor, says the average monthly withdrawal before the pandemic was £1,782. It then dropped to £1,534 as lockdowns were imposed and people were spending less.  The combined pressure of a need for cash to cover higher living expenses, and the falling stock market, leads to a \"double depletion\" effect on savings, she says, and an anxiety for pensioners.  \"It\\'s the existential angst perennially faced by retirees on limited means, whose pensions have to last the rest of their lives.  \"But it\\'s worse now than ever as a result of diminishing stock market returns and high inflation, which both erodes the value of the pot and puts pressure on people to withdraw more,\" says O\\'Connor.  \"Withdrawing more from a diminishing pot means a higher risk of running out of money later on. You may take the view that you need it now, whereas you might not need it in 10 or 20 years when you reach your 80s.  \"That might turn out to be true, but even when you are 80, there can be unexpected calls on your income that you could need to cover.\"  O\\'Connor says that she expects to see withdrawals rising even higher in the future as living costs increase, and there are more opportunities to spend with society reopening after the pandemic.',\n",
       " 'Options Can Apple Stock Hold Its 200-Day Line? Options Trade Makes Quick 14% Return If It Does Apple showed impressive strength in the last two days, rising back above the all-important 200-day moving average.  According to the IBD Stock Checkup, Apple stock is ranked No. 1 in its group and has a Composite Rating of 87, an EPS Rating of 95 and a Relative Strength Rating of 85.  Investors who think AAPL stock will stay above the 200-day moving average for the next week or two could look at a short-term bull put spread.  To execute a bull put spread an investor would sell an out-of-the-money put and then buy a further out-of-the-money put.  Selling the April 1 put with a strike price of 150 and buying the 145 put would create a bull put spread.  This spread was trading Wednesday for around $0.60 a share. That means a trader selling this spread would receive $60 in option premium and would have a maximum risk of $440.  13.64% Return By April 1  That represents a 13.64% return on risk between now and April 1 if Apple stock remains above 150.  If Apple stock closes below 145 on the expiration date, the trade loses the full $440.  The break-even point for the bull put spread is 149.40, which is calculated as 150 less the $0.60 option premium per contract.  This bull put spread trade has a delta of 8, which means it is a similar exposure to owning eight shares of Apple, although this exposure will change over time as the stock price moves.  In terms of a stop loss, if the spread increased in price from $0.60 to $1.20, I would consider closing early for a loss, or if Apple stock closed below 153.  With earnings due in late April, this trade should have no earnings risk unless Apple gives early guidance.  Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment.

Shelly Paterson, from Kirkcaldy, Fife, is distraught after sentimental items from her children\\'s births, as well as a ribbon from her late father\\'s coffin were binned.  The items were removed by officials from council contractor Orbis Protect Ltd, who had entered the property by mistake.  A week before Christmas, Shelly was given just three days to pack up her belongings from her council property in Brodick Road, Kirkcaldy, after a new home became available.  Despite being granted some extra time to move out, Shelly returned to the property on December 21 to discover that the house had been stripped bare.  She said: \"I couldn\\'t believe it. Every last thing had been removed, there was nothing at all left.  \"Everything from children\\'s clothes, furniture, even the Christmas tree, decorations and children\\'s presents had gone.  \"Most distressing of all was the loss of my children\\'s baby memory boxes, full of items from when they were born.  \"The ribbon that had adorned my father\\'s coffin at his funeral had also been taken.\"  Shelly added: \"The thought that these things will never be able to be replaced is sickening.  \"Even though I alerted the council that my belongings had been removed, I was told that everything had already been disposed of.  \"I was left just four days before Christmas with no presents to give my two children.

How surging demand and the Ukraine war sent energy prices rocketing Energy regulator Ofgem is set to raise its energy price cap by £693 to £1,971 a year from April 1st -with millions likely to be plunged into fuel poverty  UK households are currently bracing themselves for a sharp increase in energy prices. Energy industry regulator Ofgem is poised to lift its energy price cap by £693 to £1,971 a year from April 1st.  The increase has prompted fears about the impact on struggling consumers, with millions of people across the country now finding themselves at the sharp end of the cost of living crisis. Several million are expected to be plunged into fuel poverty.  To make matters even worse, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has sent wholesale energy prices rocketing. But why exactly is electricity so expensive  READ MORE: How will the war in Ukraine affect energy prices Consumers warned to expect £3,000-a-year bills  Why is electricity so expensive  Wholesale energy prices have been soaring in recent months, putting further pressure on household bills. A combination of surging demand, tensions in eastern Europe and heavy reliance on natural gas are among the factors driving energy prices higher.  Demand for energy rebounded sharply as economies around Europe began to reopen following the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, putting supplies under pressure and sending gas prices on wholesale markets skyrocketing.  As energy suppliers buy their own energy on the wholesale market, this has put them under serious pressure. Scores of smaller UK energy firms have failed in recent months, having been left unable to deliver on their price promises to customers.  Compounding the problem, Britain has been left especially exposed to sudden fluctuations in wholesale energy markets by its lack of long-term gas storage facilities. The Rough storage facility in the North Sea was closed in 2017.  The recent Russian invasion of Ukraine has again sent natural gas prices soaring on wholesale markets. Russian supplies around 40 per cent of the European Union's gas, with concerns that this supply could be stopped altogether as tensions worsen.  Britain obtains relatively little of its gas from Russia -around five per cent -but any disruption to Russia's supplies to Europe has inevitable knock-on effects elsewhere, as it forces other countries to seek new sources for their gas.  Ofgem has been under huge pressure from suppliers to lift its energy price cap and allow them to charge more, which it is now doing. It is expected to raise the energy price cap again when it next reviews it, which it is scheduled to do in August.

An IRA is a personal savings plan that lets employees and the self-employed set money aside for retirement and can have tax advantages. Contributions for 2021 can be made to a traditional or Roth IRA until the filing due date, April 18, but must be designated for 2021 to the financial institution.  Generally, eligible taxpayers can contribute up to $6,000 to an IRA for 2021. For those 50 years of age or older at the end of 2021, the limit is increased to $7,000. Qualified contributions to one or more traditional IRAs may be deductible up to the contribution limit or 100% of the taxpayer's compensation, whichever is less. There is no longer a maximum age for making IRA contributions.  Those who make contributions to certain employer retirement plans, such as a 401k or 403(b), an IRA, or an Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account, may be able to claim the Saver's Credit. Also known as the Retirement Savings Contributions Credit, the amount of the credit is generally based on the amount of contributions, the adjusted gross income and the taxpayer's filing status. The lower the taxpayer's income (or joint income, if applicable), the higher the amount of the tax credit. Dependents and full-time students are not eligible for the credit. For more information on annual contributions to an ABLE account, see Publication 907, Tax Highlights for Persons With Disabilities.PDF  While contributions to a Roth IRA are not tax deductible, qualified distributions are tax-free. Roth IRA contributions may be limited based on filing status and income. Contributions can also be made to a traditional and/or Roth IRA even if participating in an employer-sponsored retirement plan (including a SEP or SIMPLE IRA-based plan).  Taxpayers can find answers to questions, forms and instructions and easy-to-use tools at IRS.gov. This news release is part of a series called the Tax Time Guide, a resource to help taxpayers file an accurate tax return.

       " 'Pensions Pension providers call for personalised advice rules Pension providers have called on MPs to change advice rules to allow them to offer more personalised guidance.  In evidence submitted as part of the Work and Pensions Committee\\'s inquiry into the impact of pension freedoms, Royal London, Aviva, Phoenix and Legal & General all called for a regulatory regime that can allow providers to tailor their support to people\\'s individual needs.  Royal London and Phoenix both highlighted the need for more clarity on the boundary between guidance and advice, with the former saying there is a lot more pension providers can do to help individuals, but are afraid to do so due to fears of stepping over the boundary between guidance and advice.  \"As many individuals are unwilling to pay for full advice on cost grounds, a simplified advice offering at a cheaper cost would allow more individuals to be able to access affordable advice on saving for retirement, or using their pension savings in the most appropriate way,\" the company added.  Phoenix agreed, emphasising the gap in support providers can give.  \"This [clarification] can provide a vital route to a range of providers being able to provide broader guidance or targeted advice which enables much more of the population to receive the kind of contextualised, personalised, support required to address the complex decisions they are facing,\" the group said.  Aviva outlined how the current regulatory framework poses a barrier to providers\\' efforts in utilising digital innovation to provide affordable automated advice and personalised guidance.  \"UK\\'s advice rules (from MiFID) prevent firms providing personalised support to customers given the liability risk,\" it said in its submission.  The group said a new regulatory framework is needed to allow providers to give free personalised advice, which sets out how and when consumer data can be used, clearly defines firms\\' liability and protects consumers from \"unscrupulous firms\".  This will require legislation to implement, it said.  Scottish Widows said a regulatory regime that supports more personalised guidance and simplified advice would also allow providers to alert customers who \"appear to be making suboptimal decisions\".  The company added a simplified advice offering would allow advisers to provide advice on a narrower basis, meaning an expert could answer a single question or provide a solution to a single problem, as opposed to a holistic approach that requires a broad understanding of the clients\\' entire financial circumstances.  \"This would provide customers with a level of financial support that is specific and more affordable for the mass market.\"  The inquiry is focussed on whether households have enough pension savings for retirement and how the government can improve outcomes for individuals.  It is looking at issues around auto-enrolment, retirement income targets and guidance and advice.  It is also looking into what support is available for the self-employed and gig economy workers and possible measures to close the gender pensions gap.  These submissions are part of the third and final stage of the inquiry.  sally.hickey@ft.com',\n",

       " 'Money,News Money,Aldi NO BUM DEAL Aldi is giving away FREE nappies to shoppers - how to get them ALDI shoppers can pick up FREE nappies in-store with an easy to claim voucher.  Parents are facing rising costs from their shopping to their home bills, so the freebie comes as a welcome relief from rocketing grocery bills too.  On offer is a 24 pack of Mamia size one newborn nappies - which usually cost 79p to buy from the budget supermarket.  But parents can get the full-sized pack free of charge thanks to a Netmums trial.  Eagle-eyed bargain hunters on Latest Deals shared the find as they revealed exactly how to claim the freebie in your weekly shop.  One said: \"It does actually work - I got the free nappies when my grandson was born.\"  While another said: \"Good for parents to be!\"  How to get the freebie  To claim the pack you just have to fill out your details on Netmums\\' free-sample form and then you\\'ll be mailed a voucher for one pack of newborn nappies.  It only works for the one size of nappies though - which are designed to fit babies weighing between 4-11lbs (2-5kg).  The voucher itself can take up to two weeks to arrive, but you have until December 31 to use it to redeem the freebie.  Once you have your voucher, take it to your local Aldi store and show it at the checkout.  The only catch is that the Mamia newborn nappies are exclusively available at Aldi, so you won\\'t be able to pick them up anywhere else.  You have to venture into the store to pick them up too, as the freebie can\\'t be redeemed online.  You can use Aldi\\'s store locator tool to easily find out where that is though.  Keep in mind they\\'ll only be available while stocks last.  Are there other freebies I can get as a parent?  The free Aldi nappies aren\\'t the only way new mums and dads can stock up on a budget either.  Struggling parents can pick up free essentials for their children from baby banks across the UK - and more than 100 sites offer free nappies, clothes and toys to especially hard-up families.  What\\'s available in your local area can vary, but charities such as Citizens Advice and Trussell Trust will be able to provide more information on what you can claim.  The Household Support Fund includes support for parents can make use of free food vouchers and more, too, especially when they have very young children.  Local councils hand out grants for residents to spend on essentials, so it\\'s worth checking with yours to see if you could be eligible.  Similarly, parents can get up to £442 worth of free food over the year using Healthy Start vouchers.  We pay for your stories!  Do you have a story for The Sun Online Money team?

       " \"Options Find Expected Moves For Key Earnings This Week Using Options Earnings season continues with some big names reporting earnings this week. It's still a tough market environment, but good to know the expected moves.  We have Home Depot, Teladoc and Virgin Galactic on Tuesday; Lowes, Fubo and ebay on Wednesday. Alibaba, Block and Coinbase report on Thursday. And finally we have Foot Locker on Friday.  It's shaping up to be a busy week.  Those who are wondering what sort of stock moves we might see can use the options market to gain an insight into the market's expectation.  Expected Moves For This Week's Earnings  We can use what is called the expected move. This tells us the market's expected range for an underlying stock for a specific period.  The quickest way to work out the expected move is to look up the option chain and add the price of the at-the-money put option to the at-the-money call option. We use the first expiry date after the earnings date.  While this approach isn't as accurate as a detailed calculation, it does serve as a reasonably accurate estimate.  Let's take a look at the expected moves for these and other companies' earnings this week:  Tuesday  HD - 5.1%  TDOC - 18.4%  SPCE - 17.7%  MELI - 12.5%  Wednesday  LOW - 6.2%  FUBO - 18.7%  EBAY - 8.5%  Thursday  BABA - 8.7%  MRNA - 11.5%  NKLA - 14.2%  NCLH - 7.8%  SQ - 17.1%  COIN - 13.0%  ETSY - 16.2%  BYND - 17.1%  Friday  FL - 10.0%  Options Trades Based On Earnings  Options traders can use these expected moves to structure trades. Bearish traders can look at selling bear call spreads outside the expected range.  Bullish traders can sell bull put spreads outside the expected range or look at naked puts for those with a higher risk tolerance.  Neutral traders can look at iron condors. For iron condors, it is best to keep the short strikes outside the expected range.  When trading options over earnings, it's best to stick to risk-defined strategies and keep position sizes small. If the stock makes a larger-than-expected move and the trade suffers a full loss, it should not have more than a 1%-3% effect on your portfolio.  Good luck this week, traders.  Please remember that options are risky, and investors can lose 100% of their investment. This article is for education purposes only and not a trade recommendation. Remember to always do your own due diligence and consult your financial advisor before making any investment decisions.

       " 'News Water bills to increase by 10% NORTH EAST CUSTOMERS STILL PAY LESS THAN MOST  STRUGGLING families hit by a wave of cost increases will be hit by another hike when Northumbrian Water raises its prices by 10% in April.  Customers in our region will pay an average bill of £365 per year for their water and sewerage services, up by £37 compared to this year.  But although the percentage rise is the highest in the country, the overall cost of the bill is second lowest, with only Hafren Dyfrdwy customers in Wales paying less, at £334 per year.  Customers of South West Water will still pay a whopping £472 from April, even after a price reduction of 6% and a £50 contribution from the government.  Water bills across England and Wales are set to rise by an average of 1.7% in April 2022 - that\\'s a rise of £7 a year on a typical bill.  Northumbrian Water defended the rise, which affects both water meter and water rates customers, saying it was investing over £450m in the region\\'s water and wastewater networks during 2022, part of a five-year £2.4bn investment plan between 2020 and 2025.  Projects in the pipeline include a £30m spend on sewer network improvements across County Durham and an investigation into bathing water quality in Marsden, South Tyneside.  The company will also invest £145m to improve water quality and futureproof Northumbrian Water\\'s supply network in the south of County Durham and into Teesside.  The Project Pipeline: Durham and Tees Valley will include replacing some sections of the network that are more than 100 years old and installing 17 miles of new pipes, connecting Lartington Water Treatment Works with Shildon, via Whorley Hill.  A spokesman said the rise amounts to about 72p per week, with customers paying on average £1 a day for their water and sewerage services, and bills remain lower than they were in 2019.  Northumbrian Water\\'s chief executive, Heidi Mottram, said: \"We have a responsibility to look after our customers, our communities and our precious water environment, which is why we\\'re committed to investing millions of pounds across the region to do just that.  \"Our plans will not only allow us to continue delivering a reliable service to customers, both now and into the future, but will also help us to tackle some of the environmental challenges we face, brought about by climate change and severe weather conditions.  \"These essential investments, together with the rising costs of inflation has meant it is necessary for us to increase our prices by a small amount.  \"However, we are very conscious of the financial challenges that some of our customers are facing, particularly in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the rising costs of living, and we want to reassure our customers that there are lots of ways that we can offer support.\"  We are very conscious of the financial challenges that some of our customers are facing Heidi Mottram',\n",

       " 'Energy deal ban: Ofgem green lights major change for Brits - \\'More resilient and fair\\' OFGEM is set to ban energy suppliers from only offering discount deals to new customers, in an attempt to stop more energy firms going bust.  The policy will mean that these deals must be offered to both new and existing customers, as well as stopping loyal customers being penalised for not switching energy suppliers. Since September last year, more than two dozen energy companies have gone bust, having relied on new customers with discounted deals and loss making prices to stay solvent.  Related articles  They were unable to stay afloat when the price of gas on the wholesale market dramatically increased.  The policy, set to be implemented on April 14, will remain in place for six months before Ofgem reviews it and decides whether it will become permanent.  Simon Oscroft, co-founder of energy supplier So Energy, said the policy would, \"help build a more resilient and fairer energy energy market as we begin to emerge from this crisis\".  In a statement, Ofgem said: \"The energy market has faced a huge challenge due to the unprecedented increase in global gas prices, a once-in-a-30-year event.  \"We\\'re putting in place short-term measures to protect customers.  \"All suppliers will have to offer existing customers the same deals available to new customers.  \"This will ensure customers can benefit from all tariffs available in the market and enable more customers to benefit when wholesale prices fall.

       " 'Money Couple who bought B&Q plant for just £12 discover its leaves are worth £170 each Harry Langstaff and Amy Biffa couldn\\'t believe it when they spotted the super rare monstera Aurea marmorata plant had been marked down from £24 to £12 in their local B&Q  A couple are quids in after they purchased a rare plant from B&Q for just £12 -but its leaves are worth £170 each.  Harry Langstaff and Amy Biffa spotted the plant had been marked down from £24 to £12.  The couple believe it had been reduced due to yellow colouring that had appeared on its leaves, which staff could\\'ve mistaken for a disease -but this actually means the plant is extremely rare.  Harry and Amy picked up a monstera Aurea marmorata -which can sell for anywhere between £200 for a clipping, to £2,000 for a whole plant.  The amateur botanists said they felt like they were \"winning the lottery\" when they spotted the discount.  It comes after plant collectors urged shoppers to check shops for unusual shrubs in B&Q and Lidl -again, as staff are mistakenly marking down rare species over fears they are sick.  Harry told The Sun : \"When we first saw the plant sitting there, we kind of just looked at each other and really couldn\\'t believe what we were seeing.  \"It was reduced to £12 because it had a yellow leaf that B&Q must have assumed meant it was sick.  \"We hastily checked the stem for any colour, we then immediately just snatched it up and strapped it in the back seat with a seatbelt like it was our child.\"  The couple had been searching stores for rare plants for their small business, The Plant Couple.  Harry reckons their plant is worth about £600 at the moment and says they\\'ll sell the leaves at £170 each.  The couple say the plant would need to have elaborate multi-coloured leaves to be worth as much as £2,000.  To check whether your plant is rare or just has one yellow dry leaf, Harry recommends looking at the stem to see if this too is also yellow or white.  If the stem shows signs of striping, then it\\'s variegated -which means showing different colours -and your plant could be worth a small fortune.  Even then, you have to wait until it has grown properly to make sure it isn\\'t just a disease.  Harry says the chances of finding a super rare plant in a local shop can be \"extremely slim, one in a million\".  A B&Q spokesperson said: \"At B&Q we\\'re pretty proud of the quality of our house plants so we can see why it\\'s been reported that our plants could be worth up to £4,000.  \"Whilst we don\\'t sell the extremely rare plants in question, we do sell top quality houseplants that our customers are more familiar with and that are more purse-friendly!\"',\n",
       " \"News Drivers face £35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue * Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police  * But at present drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty nor vehicle excise duty  * Government urged to have a 'conversation' with drivers on new ways to be taxed  * The report recommends 'road pricing' which would charge drivers per car trip  Drivers will have to pay new taxes to plug the £35billion shortfall created by the switch to electric cars - and ministers must spell out what they are, a report says today.  The Commons transport committee's report urges the Government to start an 'up-front conversation' with drivers about new ways they could be taxed.  At present, drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty, which nets £28billion a year, or vehicle excise duty, which brings in £7billion.  Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police.  Vehicle excise duty is spent fixing roads. To replace them, the report recommends 'road pricing', which would charge drivers per trip, based on the distance travelled, duration of the journey and vehicle type.  It also urges ministers to set up an arms-length body to recommend a new regime by the end of this year.  The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030, so millions of motorists are expected to go electric before then.  A government spokesman said it was committed to keeping the transition to electric cars 'affordable for consumers'.  Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show plug-in vehicles accounted for more than one in six new cars registered in the UK last year.  'The situation is urgent,' the report warned. 'Work must begin without delay.'  Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said the UK faces a '£35 billion black hole in finances unless the Government acts now'.  He went on: 'That's 4% of the entire tax-take. Only £7 billion of this goes back to the roads; schools and hospitals could be impacted if motorists don't continue to pay.  'We need to talk about road pricing.  'Innovative technology could deliver a national road pricing scheme which prices up a journey based on the amount of road, and type of vehicle, used.'  He added: 'Net-zero emissions should not mean zero tax revenue.'  RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the 'silver lining of zero-carbon motoring comes wrapped in a cloud of trouble for the Chancellor'.  He went on: 'Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next - particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change.  'If the Treasury is thinking it can leave this issue for another day but still recoup their losses from electric vehicles they risk a furious backlash from drivers who made the choice to go electric expecting to save money.'\",\n",
       " 'Index Sultan \\'partner\\' joins will battle A WOMAN stated to be the de facto partner of late property mogul Ali Sultan has been drawn into a high-profile estate battle with his eldest son.  Moe Sultan is challenging his father\\'s will in an ongoing Supreme Court of Tasmania clash, alleging executors and trustees of his father\\'s most recent will misused money from the estate and appointed themselves directors of Sultan Holdings.  Rola Taychouri-Smith has recently been added as a defendant in the proceedings, with Moe Sultan noting various incarnations of his father\\'s will since November 2018 granted her annual legacies and/or a specific bequest.  Moe Sultan says his father\\'s last true will was made in July 2018 or earlier, and that subsequent versions did not represent his father\\'s intentions and were not valid wills \"as he did not know and approve his contents\" when he executed them.  In her defence filed with the court, Ms Taychouri-Smith says she was the second cousin of Ali Sultan as her paternal grandmother was his maternal grandmother\\'s sister.  But she also said she had been in a romantic relationship with Ali Sultan at the time of his death as his de facto spouse. She said that while Ali Sultan was married to Christine Sultan, their relationship ended in 2014 and they were \"in the final stage of formalising their divorce at the time the deceased died\".  She denied wills made in November 2018, November 2019 and December 2020 were invalid.  Ali Sultan, a well-known businessman, died unexpectedly in January 2021 after a heart attack while walking on kunanyi/Mt Wellington.  Moe Sultan claims his father had limited English skills, particularly in comprehension of written documents, and that newer versions of the will did not reflect his intentions. A number of defendants have already denied claims of wrongdoing in the case, including Integrity Commission chief commissioner Aziz Gregory Melick, Sultan Holdings accountant Mark Saltzman and lawyer Damian Egan.  Moe Sultan\\'s younger brother Saleh, also listed as a defendant, has previously filed a written defence with the court, although the amended statement of claim does not allege any wrongdoing by him.  Two further defendants, Mezed Eid and Mohamad Eid, have now also filed a joint defence with the court, denying claims the later versions of Ali Sultan\\'s will were not valid.  However, they agreed with Moe Sultan\\'s claims that the December 2020 will did not represent Ali Sultan\\'s testamentary intentions.  Two defendants - lawyer Ian Creese and Sultan Holdings project development manager Timothy Lucas - previously rescinded their involvement and are no longer parties to the dispute.  On Wednesday, lawyers for all parties involved appeared in the Supreme Court of Tasmania via video link before Associate Justice Stephen Holt. He ordered all defendants file affidavit material within 21 days, with a further directions hearing to be held on March 9. The matter is slated for mediation, and if it does not resolve will go to trial.',\n",

Hickenlooper (D-CO) News Release Denver, Colo.-Today, Senator John Hickenlooper applauded Connect for Health Colorado\\'s announcement that 198,412 Coloradans signed up for a health insurance plan by the end of the most recent Open Enrollment Period. This marks an increase of more than 18,000 enrollments, or 10 percent, above last year\\'s end of Open Enrollment total, and is the highest end of Open Enrollment total since Connect for Health Colorado opened in 2013.  Three out of four customers who signed up for a plan qualified for health insurance savings via premium subsidies passed by Congress as part of the American Rescue Plan. Thanks to these subsidies, individuals can save an average of 52 percent on their monthly premium.  While the annual enrollment period has ended, uninsured residents who have been impacted by the recent fires in Boulder County or by COVID-19 can access a new Disaster Relief Special Enrollment Period now through March 16, 2022.  \"These numbers prove Connect for Health Colorado is a success story,\" said Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper. \"Congress needs to keep premiums low to make health care an affordable reality for every Coloradan.\"  \"The record level of enrollments we\\'re seeing tells me that people are finding plans in their budget and that our sign-up process is smoother than ever before,\" said Chief Executive Officer Kevin Patterson.  \"While the regular Open Enrollment Period is complete, we opened our doors again. We\\'re here to make sure those who find themselves affected by the recent Marshall Fire and the pandemic can get the coverage and care they need,\" Patterson said.  \"The American Rescue Plan helped make health care more affordable and accessible for nearly 200,000 Coloradans. That is what progress looks like,\" said Colorado Senator Michael Bennet. \"As we continue to face ongoing challenges as a result of COVID-19 and the Marshall Fire, I\\'m grateful that the enrollment deadline has been extended to ensure more families can get covered this year.\"  Additional Enrollment Opportunities and Assistance  Qualifying events, like certain household changes or losing health insurance from a job, also open a 60-day Special Enrollment Period for residents who need health insurance or want to change their plan.

The high street health and beauty retailer has brought back its Price Advantage initiative permanently, as of this month.  Price Advantage gives exclusive discounts to Boots customers with an Advantage card in over 2,000 stores across the UK.  Shoppers have to hand over their Advantage Card at the tills to get the lower price that is advertised on the shelves.  Customers will know if an item is included in the Price Advantage as they\\'ll be advertised with a pink sticker in stores.  The pink stickers will show the price for Advantage Card holders and the price for other shoppers.  Price Advantage isn\\'t available on the Boots website and shoppers without an Advantage Card won\\'t be able to get the lower prices.  Boots says shoppers will see discounts on around 150 products each month.  This month, customers can save over £8 on the L\\'Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser Pure Retinol Deep Anti-Wrinkle Night Serum which costs £16.60 for Advantage Card holders, compared to £24.99 for regular customers.  Also on offer is Boots\\' No7 Lash Extender Fiber Mascara, down to £11.95 from £13.95, as well as Boots\\' Ingredients Hyaluronic Acid Serum 30ml, which is reduced to £4 from £5.  Do you think Boots\\' Advantage Card is worth it Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.  However, just because something is included in Advantage Prices, that doesn\\'t necessarily mean you won\\'t find it cheaper at another store.  Make sure you compare prices online using websites such as Price Spy and CamelCamelCamel to check you\\'re getting the best deal.  Always go for the lowest price to make the biggest saving.  What is an Advantage Card  It is free to sign up for an Advantage Card -you can do this on the Boots website -and the scheme allows you to accrue points as you shop.  Advantage Card holders get four points for every £1 spent -and points are worth 1p each in return.  This means if you collect 100 points, you\\'d have £1 to spend, while 1,000 points are worth £10.  You can also get personalised discounts sent to you by Boots by being an Advantage Card holder.  A spokesperson from Boots said: \"Helping shoppers get more out of life for less, all Boots Advantage Card holders will be given access to the Price Advantage programme meaning they\\'ll be able to get their hands on even bigger savings by being members of the loyalty scheme.\"  Boots says it will also release hundreds of half price deals this month, as well as offering everyday essentials for just £2.',\n",
       " 'Money Martin Lewis fan explains how he saved £400 after Virgin confirmed price hikes MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis has explained how a viewer, was able to save £400 after finding a better deal after Virgin Media confirmed it was raising prices  A Martin Lewis  fan has explained how they saved £400 after Virgin Media  announced it was hiking prices.  Virgin last week confirmed that it would raise prices by £56  a year for millions of customers.  The telecoms giant said almost all mobile, TV and broadband customers will be affected from March 1, 2022 -unless the household falls under the \\'vulnerable\\' bracket.  After flagging the price hike on his ITV  show, Martin and his co-star Angelica Bell explained how one viewer has managed to make a huge saving by looking for a cheaper deal elsewhere.  The saver, known only as David, said: \"Thanks to watching the show, I rang Virgin.  \"They weren\\'t able to beat a deal I had found elsewhere and so I\\'ve started the process of leaving them? for a deal that is £400 cheaper per year.  \"Plus the new deal has 2.5 times faster speeds!\"  It isn\\'t clear what type of deal David had with Virgin, or what new supplier he is switching over to.  But if you\\'re coming out of your current broadband, phone or TV package, then it might be time to check if you can make savings too.  Have you managed to save money on your bills Let us know your story: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  How to save money on your bills  If you\\'re out of contract, the first thing you should do is compare prices to see if you\\'re getting the best deal.  You can compare prices using CompareTheMarket.com , Confused.com , MoneySupermarket.co.uk  or Uswitch.com .  If you do spot a better deal and you\\'re out of contract, you should be able to switch providers for free.  But if you\\'re still locked into a service or you don\\'t want to leave your current provider, then you could try haggling.  Haggling is never guaranteed to always work, but if you do pull it off, you could end up making huge savings.  Start by calling up the customer service centre of your current broadband provider, and then give them details of the cheaper deal you\\'ve found -and ask if they can match it.  If they say they can\\'t match it, you could try telling them you\\'re thinking about disconnecting to see if that has any more sway.  Those who are still in contract and are desperate to leave should also check how much they\\'d have to pay to leave early, as you may still save money if the deal you\\'ve found elsewhere is massively cheaper.  For example, if you had to pay £50 to leave your current provider, but a new deal would save you £400 a year, it would be worth paying the exit fee.',\n",

This is because you could be deemed to be driving a car in a dangerous condition, if broken or blunt wiper blades stop you from clearing your windscreen properly.  If your wiper blades aren\\'t working, then your visibility of the road could be affected while you\\'re driving.  As well as risking a £2,500 fine, you could also see three points added to your driving licence, according to National Tyres and Autocare.  If the offence is committed within three years of a previous conviction for a similar offence, then you could be disqualified from driving for a minimum of six years.  Failure to have proper control of a vehicle or full view of the road and traffic ahead also carries a fine of £1,000 -or £2,500 for passenger-carrying or goods vehicles.  Section 40a of The Road Traffic Act: Using a Vehicle in a Dangerous Condition Part II, states that: \"A person is guilty of an offence if he uses, or causes or permits another to use, a motor vehicle or trailer on a road when the condition of the motor vehicle or trailer, or of its accessories or equipment is such that the use of the motor vehicle or trailer involves a danger of injury to any person.\"  Michael Bourne, Group Marketing Director of National Tyres commented: \"Windscreen wipers are pivotal to safety and being able to see those around you, yet there are so many people unaware of how important it is to keep them in the best possible condition.  \"The last thing a driver wants is to realise their visibility is compromised by defective windscreen wipers when they\\'re travelling at speed or when the weather suddenly turns bad.  \"With winter just around the corner, it\\'s important that motorists are mindful of their own safety and the condition of their vehicle is of paramount importance to other road users.\"  Have you successfully appealed a driving fine Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  How to check your wiper blades  Your car can fail its MOT if your windscreen wipers don\\'t work properly or they don\\'t clear your windscreen effectively.

In any other circumstance a 50p is worth exactly that - 50p. But this coin features a unique twist that means it's more in demand than any other.  That means collectors, who know what they're looking for, will offer high prices to get their owns hands on a copy.  It's because the coin is the rarest of them all-according to Change Checker's latest scarcity index anyway.  It's the rare 2009 Kew Gardens 50p, of which only 210,000 exist.  On the reverse side it features an image of the Chinese pagoda that stands at the heart of the London attraction the coin is named after.  We often see this particular style coin sell for hundreds of pounds on eBay so it's no strange feat, and this particular coin managed to catch the attention of 28 bids.  Those were placed within the short time frame of just one day, though bids kicked off at a whopping £90 to start with.  We've seen copies of the coin reach £190 in the past, and £177 before too, so £250 is an impressive price to call the final sale on.  How to spot one and make a mint  It's always worthing having a rifle through your own change to spot any unique designs - if you find one you could make a lot of money from it on eBay.  The Kew Gardens 50p, like other commemorative style coins, will usually sell for hundreds of pounds, so you could definitely make a mint.  Even the odd minting error raises interest too.  They'll all usually be produced in low numbers so demand from collectors is high.  If you look at other listings on eBay you'll be able to determine how much your own change could go for.  But you should also always keep in mind that on eBay a buyer could pull out, which means the coin won't have sold for the price it says it has.

A runaway winner on his only start in the point-to-point field, Classic Getaway was snapped up for £570,000 by bloodstock agent Tom Malone and trainer Gordon Elliott on behalf of Cheveley Park Stud.  After leaving Elliott to join Willie Mullins, the six-year-old made a successful debut under rules with a 15-length verdict in a Tipperary bumper last May and was the 5-6 favourite on his return to action.  Partnered by Paul Townend, Classic Getaway tracked the Danny Mullins-ridden Cash Back during the early stages before taking over with a circuit to run.

       " 'Money UK annual spending on ethical products surpasses £100bn for first time Report says climate crisis and Covid have fuelled demand for plant-based foods, secondhand goods and greener gadgets  Britons\\' annual spending on ethical products and investments has surpassed £100bn for the first time, as lifestyle changes linked to Covid and the climate crisis stoked demand for plant-based foods, secondhand clothes and furniture, and greener gadgets.  The value of the \"green\" pound surged by nearly a quarter to £122bn in 2020, according to a new Co-op report covering the most recent year for which figures are available. That total was bolstered by £57bn of ethical savings and investments.  Shoppers spent £61bn on ethical products and services, which was nearly 30% more than in 2019. That equates to £2,189 a household, a £489 increase. The equivalent figure for 2010 was £1,028.  The retailer\\'s ethical consumerism report, which is a barometer of the extent to which consumers\\' shopping habits reflect their concerns about the environment, animal welfare and social justice, also found more shoppers were boycotting brands on ethical or social concerns. These businesses suffered a £3.9bn loss of sales, which was £600m bigger than the previous year.  Steve Murrells, the Co-op\\'s chief executive, said shoppers were \"turning up the heat\" to get companies to change. The boycotts were a \"warning to brands that they must do business in a better way for workers, communities and the planet\", he said.  The huge increase in ethical spending also showed that when businesses provide choice, and the government offers helpful incentives, \"consumers will respond positively\", Murrells added.  The area of the market that saw the biggest increase was eco-travel and transport, where sales rose by more than 70% to £12.2bn. This reflected the rise in electric car ownership as well as the impact of the pandemic, which revived cycling to levels last seen in Britain in the 1960s.  Britons are also trying to make their homes greener by investing in energy-efficient boilers as well as other household appliances or switching to \"green\" electricity deals. Taken together this market had expanded by a third to be worth £20.5bn.  However, this push fell short of what is needed to hit the government\\'s net zero targets, the Co-op said. For example, while households spent £5bn on energy-efficient gas boilers, just £130m went on heat pumps.  The report also highlighted the growing appetite to buy secondhand goods, be it for financial or environmental reasons. Sales of secondhand clothes increased by nearly a quarter to £864m while spending on \"pre-loved\" furniture was up by more than £100m at £837m.  In the now £14bn ethical food and drink market the sales trends reflect people making changes to their diet, with demand for vegetarian and plant-based foods up 34% at £1.5bn. Fairtrade and organic food also grew strongly, up 14% and 13% respectively, while free-range egg sales exceeded £1bn for the first time.',\n",
       " 'News ASIC probing 67 super fund employees for trading deals Exclusive  The corporate regulator is scrutinising investment switches made by 67 super fund workers as it considers whether to take fund employees to court for insider trading.  The Australian Securities and Investments Commission has been investigating whether to take superannuation fund executives to court for moving their personal retirement savings out of unlisted assets before the investments were dramatically valued lower at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ASIC in October revealed it was investigating whether executives across 23 super funds had used their access to price-sensitive valuation information \"for personal gain by switching investment options based on their knowledge of the timing of the revaluation of unlisted assets\".  Although the behaviour in question does not breach insider trading laws, ASIC has previously said it was \"similar to insider trading and may contravene other provisions of the law\".  Since unlisted assets are only revalued periodically, a super fund executive could trade on inside information by moving their savings out of an investment option with an allocation to unlisted assets before the fund revalued these investments lower.  In response to a question on notice from Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, ASIC said it had \"identified 67 individuals, comprising directors, executives, and related parties who had made a change, including one-off withdrawals or additions, to their investment options between 1 January 2020 to 18 December 2020\".  ASIC did not specify exactly how many of the 67 employees switched out of unlisted assets, or how many of the switches occurred at the onset of the pandemic.  The regulator said it reviewed the switches made by the 67 employees and then excluded trades that were not conducted close to a revaluation and switches by individuals who did not have access to sensitive information. It also excluded trades where the individual suffered a financial loss.  ASIC said it then sought additional information about four individuals \"to obtain further clarity about both the timing of their trades and their access to sensitive information. Our review of that additional information is ongoing\".  Senator Bragg told AFR Weekend the revelations showed there were deep-seated problems in the $3.4 trillion super sector.  \"It shows there\\'s a systemic problem of insider trading in super funds and I\\'ll be watching closely what ASIC does next,\" he said.  \"I\\'m very concerned that ASIC has identified directors because that means that there are people who are potentially working in other organisations ... who are also in the gun here.\"  Senator Bragg said the government needed to consider options for law reform, including potentially prohibiting employees dealing and investing in their fund either altogether or at certain times.  ASIC\\'s investigation follows an inquiry by Parliament\\'s economics committee last year that found evidence of executives at AustralianSuper, NGS Super, Rest, First State, Hostplus and Intrust Super switching their investment options at the onset of the pandemic.  Liberal MP Tim Wilson, who chaired the committee, raised the transfers with ASIC.',\n",

But today \"more and more pension schemes are starting to understand that pensions don\\'t exist in isolation\", she said.

The UK has set a target of slashing its emissions to net zero by the middle of the century and pension funds will have to step up to be part of the effort.  Earlier this year, the All Party Parliamentary Group on local authority pension funds said pension funds should engage companies on how to transition to net zero in a fair way.  \"Funds should ensure that collaborative engagements on climate change include a just transition as a central theme for discussion,\" the paper read.  Experts believe that by unlocking the UK\\'s pension funds and putting them towards the net zero transition, it can rapidly encourage companies to change their practices.  There is some evidence this is already happening. Following shareholder pressure, not least from pension funds, oil giants Shell and BP have set out plans to get to net zero by 2050 in the last couple of years.  The power can also lie with the individual. By choosing where to invest their pensions, savers can have a major impact.  One study by Swedish bank Nordea found that moving pension savings into sustainable funds can be much more effective than normal carbon-cutting measures.  Switching your pension is 27 times more effective than shortening your showers by two minutes, taking one less international flight per year, ditching your car and taking the train and only eating one piece of meat a week.  Ms Nazarova-Doyle said there are two ways that the funds can work towards slashing emissions: \"On the one hand it\\'s about finance flows: Where do you invest the money, what do you actually support and what do you not support.  \"But also it\\'s about stewardship. So, once you have those investments you have voting rights, and you can engage with companies, you can use your shareholder power to engender real change.\"',\n",
       " \"Money,Tips,Debt help,Money saving tips CASH IN Thousands of households have just TWO WEEKS left to apply for free £50 supermarket voucher - can you claim? THOUSANDS of Brits have just two weeks left to apply for a £50 supermarket voucher to put towards buying food.  It's part of the Household Support Fund to help struggling families pay for essential costs this winter.  The £500million scheme is handed out to different councils across the UK, and they can then decide how to use the funds.  The cash is supposed to support households who are struggling to pay for food or bills.  The support that's available varies between councils, so you'll need to check with your local authority what help is available in the region you live in.  For example, Nottingham City Council is among the councils offering extra support to residents this winter.  You can apply for up to two £50 supermarket vouchers - but the deadline for one of them is this evening.  The other has a deadline of January 4, so there's still time to access help in the New Year.  To apply you should contact the council directly, and you'll need to input some details including your email address and mobile number,  You will also need to provide an address and a council tax reference number.  While this particular offer is only open to residents of Nottingham, The Sun has spotted other local authorities offering free cash and vouchers to help families.  You'll need to contact your own local council to find out what help you might be eligible for.  Each council decides who is eligible and how much to hand out, so you'll need to check what's available in your area - you can find out who yours is via the gov.uk website.  What other help is available?  The Sun has looked into all the assistance on offer from councils up and down the country - you can find out who yours is via the gov.uk website.  Families in North Yorkshire could get a £125 voucher to help pay for food and essentials  Meanwhile, those living in the East Riding of Yorkshire have until Christmas Eve to apply for up to £285 to help pay for household essentials and bills.  Shropshire Council is also giving households £115 in free cash to be put towards food, energy and water bills  If there is not Household Support Fund help available to you in your area, there are other schemes that might be able to help.  The Welfare assistance scheme can get up to £1,000 in free cash and vouchers for food, furniture and bills.  You might be able to get your council tax bill reduced if you are struggling to pay.  And if you're struggling to pay rent, you could apply for a discretionary housing payment.  We pay for your stories!  Do you have a story for The Sun Money team?

       " 'MIL-OSI USA: Attorney General Bonta: Fiduciaries of Employee Retirement Plans Should Be Allowed to Consider Climate Change, Other ESG Factors in Investment Decisions Source: US State of California  Monday, December 13, 2021  Contact: (916) 210-6000, agpressoffice@doj.ca.gov  OAKLAND - California Attorney General Rob Bonta today, leading a multistate coalition, urged the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to finalize rules clarifying that fiduciaries of private-sector employee retirement plans, such as 401(k) plans, can consider environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors when making investment decisions. Fiduciaries - including investment managers - are legally mandated to make decisions in the best interest of the people whose money they manage, in this case the millions of employees who put some of their income each month into an employer-sponsored retirement plan. By allowing fiduciaries to consider ESG factors, particularly the costs and impacts of climate change, fiduciaries can make investment decisions that better address the long-term investment horizons of the employees they represent.  \"When you put part of your paycheck into a 401(k) or another retirement account, you\\'re planning for the future. Those making decisions with your money should be able to do the same,\" said Attorney General Bonta. \"The fact is: The costs of climate change are only going to rise. Whether you\\'re a major corporation or an individual investor, that\\'s a reality you can\\'t deny. We\\'ve urged the SEC to require corporations to disclose their risks to climate change, and now, we\\'re urging DOL to empower those managing everyday Americans\\' retirement savings to make decisions with those risks in mind.\"  For many Californians who work in the private sector, employee benefit plans such as 401(k)s make up the bulk of their retirement savings. Under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act, DOL is responsible for overseeing these plans and sets standards for fiduciaries to ensure they are acting in the best interest of those they represent. DOL\\'s proposed rule would strengthen fiduciaries\\' ability to meet this responsibility by clarifying that ESG factors often are material factors that should be considered in investment decisions.  From rising temperatures to more frequent and severe weather events, climate change is already damaging infrastructure, disrupting businesses, and threatening public health in the United States and around the globe. In June, Attorney General Bonta led a coalition in urging the Securities and Exchange Commission to require U.S. companies to provide detailed and accurate information about the financial risk they face from climate change. In today\\'s comments, Attorney General Bonta and 11 other attorneys general again underscore the need to protect ordinary investors from the financial risks of climate change as its threat to various industries and corporations grows increasingly apparent.  Attorney General Bonta is joined in filing today\\'s comment by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, and Vermont.

       " \"ROP Where should I invest my inheritance? I inherited a significant amount this year, and my bank savings account now has £150,000 in it. I usually keep about £20,000 in easily accessible money for emergencies but would like to invest the remaining £130,000. Should I invest it in my pension, in a separate investment portfolio or a stocks & shares ISA?  Richard Barker of Smith & Pinching responds:  The answer to your question will depend on your overall financial plan, including your objectives for your retirement and your likely other needs between now and then. It's really important to see each financial decision as part of an overall strategy.  I suggest you meet with an independent financial adviser, ideally from a firm of chartered financial planners, to analyse everything about your financial circumstances and your situation. A financial adviser will help you identify your targets and set you on track to achieving them.  Your question asks about the merits of investing in a pension, as opposed to doing so in an investment portfolio or stocks & shares ISA. It's important to realise that pensions and stocks & shares ISAs are actually tax wrappers containing investments. They all have their place in financial planning, but the difference lies in their tax treatment.  With pensions, your contributions are invested with a view to achieving investment growth. The advantages of pensions are the tax relief given on your contributions, adding immediate value, and the fund grows tax-free. The principal drawback is that money invested in a pension fund is locked away until you reach the minimum retirement age - currently age 55 but rising to age 57 in 2028.  Pension contributions are subject to two limits: the annual allowance restricts how much you can contribute in the tax year and the lifetime allowance limits how much you can have without a charge being applied when you take your benefits. These rules are complex, so advice is vital.  Stocks & shares ISAs provide tax-efficient investment growth, with no tax payable on gains made within the ISA or income paid from it. However, the annual ISA allowance is £20,000 so you wouldn't be able to invest your whole inheritance in an ISA in a single tax year. Unused ISA allowances can't be carried forward.  Investing outside either a pension or ISA framework can also be tax-efficient, with dividend allowances and capital gains tax allowances available for use, as well as certain higher-risk investments such as venture capital trusts and enterprise investment schemes, which have special tax treatment. The key is to plan carefully to take advantage of the allowances that are available to you.  Any opinions expressed in this article do not constitute advice. The value of an investment and the income from it could go down as well as up. The return at the end of the investment period is not guaranteed and you may get back less than you originally invested.  For more information, please visit www.smith-pinching.co.uk\",\n",
       " 'GAPP Confirms Plans For ESG Framework The Guernsey Association of Pension Providers (GAPP)\\xa0is continuing its leadership in the international retirement and saving plans space by announcing plans to work on an Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) framework for its members.  GAPP President Stephen Ainsworth said the move was in response to indications that more members would welcome guidance on the growing emphasis on ESG issues for pension plans.  Although there is no fixed timescale for its release, as GAPP wants to ensure enough time is spent getting the framework right, there is a hope that it can be published around mid-2022.  \"Pension plan members are starting to question how their pension assets are being invested and are demanding ESG-friendly options,\" Stephen said. \"As a result, the GAPP Committee decided to create a specialist ESG committee to research the issues. We rapidly concluded that the guidance should be within an overarching framework, and so we needed to start with that.\"  \"Guernsey has for many years been the leading location for international retirement and savings plans and has provided thought leadership in the international pensions space. The ESG Framework is just the latest aspect in this ongoing development.\"  It is anticipated that the framework will adopt a similar structure to that of the\\xa0 Guernsey International Insurance Association\\'s (GIIA) framework, launched at WE ARE GUERNSEY\\'s Sustainable Finance Week in June 2021, including sections on governance, benefit provision, investments and reporting.  \"We were aware of the insurance framework developed by GIIA, and the positive reaction that there had been to its publication,\" Stephen said. \"Because of the many similarities between insurance business and pensions business, this seemed like a good place to start.  \"When we looked at the GIIA framework in detail we felt that several of the concepts were equally as valid for pensions as insurance. We have met with GIIA and have been encouraged by their reaction when they learned that we might develop a parallel framework for pensions.\"  Stephen said there were plenty of ways that pensions, or pension providers, could adhere more to ESG issues.  \"There are very substantial assets invested in Guernsey-based pension plans,\" he elaborated.\\xa0\"Investing these assets responsibly and sustainably can make a significant contribution to improving the environment.  \"Indeed, generally speaking, a pension plan member can make a much greater contribution to combatting climate change by investing their pension assets responsibly than by ceasing air travel or adopting a vegan diet!\"  For more information about Guernsey\\'s finance industry please visit www.weareguernsey.com.

       " '3,BUS 3 times you\\'ll need money advice from an actual person You can now manage most aspects of your money without ever consulting another human being. You can budget, borrow, save, invest, buy insurance, prepare your tax return and create a will by using apps, websites and software. But technology still has limitations. Consider consulting a human expert in the following situations:  1. Your insurance is canceled  Insurers typically can\\'t cancel a policy after 60 days unless you fail to pay premiums, commit fraud or make serious misrepresentations on your application, according to the Insurance Information Institute, a trade group. But they can decide not to renew your policy when it expires.  With auto insurance, you often have many options after such a non-renewal. Even if you\\'ve had accidents or multiple claims, you can find coverage with firms that specialize in higher-risk drivers.  If a homeowners insurance company dumps you, however, you may have trouble finding coverage. That\\'s especially true if you were dropped because you made too many claims, or your area is considered high risk because of wildfires, extreme weather or crime, for example.  How would other companies know? Insurers share such information in databases, and application forms typically ask if you\\'ve been \"non-renewed\" by another insurer.  The nonprofit organization United Policyholders recommends seeking out an independent agent or broker who has relationships with several insurance companies. The agent or broker should know which insurers may be more receptive to your application and can put in a good word for you. While most underwriting decisions are made by computers, there are still ways for human beings to override the algorithms.  2. You\\'re being audited  Most IRS audits are conducted through the mail and are relatively routine. The IRS sends a letter requesting additional documentation to support a deduction or other tax break you\\'ve taken. If you mail back sufficient evidence, your case will be closed with no taxes owed. Otherwise, the IRS will mail you a bill.  However, if the IRS wants to meet with you, the stakes get much higher. In fiscal year 2020, the average amount of additional taxes recommended in face-to-face audits was nearly 10 times larger than the average for a correspondence audit: $72,210 versus $7,658, according to IRS statistics.  It\\'s all too easy to say something you shouldn\\'t when you\\'re under scrutiny. You could volunteer information that might not be helpful to your case, or get defensive or confrontational.  3. You\\'re estate-planning  Getting help with this is particularly important if you want to do something complicated with your estate like putting conditions on a bequest, providing for someone with special needs or creating a trust. You\\'ll also want an attorney\\'s help if you have a lot of debt, because there may be ways to protect your assets from creditors. Finally, consult an attorney if you think someone might contest your will.',\n",

       " 'Money,News Money,UK interest rates and inflation GOING UP State pension rise confirmed with £290 a year extra as it goes up to almost £142 a week STATE pension payments will rise by £290 extra a year next April, it has been confirmed.  The payments will rise in line with inflation to almost £142 a week.  The inflation rate is usually used to work out how much the state pension will rise by, but the increase is not as much as many were hoping.  The state pension rises each year, and in 2022 it will go up by 3.1% based on the rate of inflation last month.  That means pensioners are set to receive a boost of a little more than £5.50 a week - around the cost of a bottle of supermarket wine - to their weekly incomes from next April.  Broken down, the basic state pension will go from £137.60 per week to £141.85 per week.  While the flat-rate state pension will rise from £179.60 per week to £185.15 per week.  Over a year that\\'s £9,628, up from £9,339 - an extra £290.  However, it could have gone up by even more than this had the government not suspended the triple lock.  The triple lock is a calculation used to determine how much the state pension rises by each year.  It guaranteed that the state pension rises by whichever is the highest out of inflation, 2.5% or wage increases.  But the lock was scrapped as wages have been artificially inflated as millions have gone back to work since the end of lockdown.  That\\'s bad news for pensioners, who would\\'ve seen a much greater increase in their weekly income if state pension had increased in line with wages.  Many will have been hoping for more, particularly as inflation is forecast to reach 5% next year and a cost of living crunch is starting to bite.  But the exact rate, and triple lock changes, are still subject to government approval.  Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at AJ Bell, previously told The Sun: \"The good news for retirees is the state pension is set to increase by 3.1% next year, boosting the incomes of those in receipt of the full flat-rate benefit by £5.55 a week.  \"The basic state pension, meanwhile, is set to rise by £4.25 to £141.85 per week.  \"However, the Government\\'s decision to suspend the earnings element of the state pension triple-lock means retirees will miss out on a blockbuster 8.3% increase.  \"This decision will \\'cost\\' someone in receipt of the full flat-rate state pension £9.35 a week in retirement income - or £486.20 over the course of the year.\"  All other benefits will rise in line with inflation at 3.1% as well.

       " 'Money \\'Russian Lidl\\' Mere delays opening more stores over supply chain problems A supermarket that wants to be the cheapest in the UK says it is struggling to recruit or give customers the range of stock they expect -but that next year will be different  Super-cheap discount supermarket Mere says its UK expansion plans are being slowed down by supply chain problems and recruitment issues.  Mere, also known as \\'Russian Lidl\\', opened its first store in Preston in August this year .  Its business model is based on being the cheapest, with goods stacked on pallets on the floor for customers to pick up as they shop.  Mere originally planned to open more than 300 stores in the UK over the next eight to ten years.  But now it\\'s plans are being held up, according to The Grocer .  The firm will now not open its second and third UK stores until next year, having originally planned to open them this year.  Mere UK business development manager Aleksandr Chkalov told The Grocer that it was \"not an easy time to provide everything\" shoppers need.  \"It\\'s not really working with suppliers right now, with all their problems with transport, drivers and fuel,\" he said. \"I have to provide more meals, more meat products.\"  But hiring the right staff is also an issue, he said.  \"The most important thing is the right team and recruitment is the hardest task, not only in the UK but all countries,\" Chkalov said.  What do you think of Mere Let us now in the comments below  \"We have tried hiring people with lots of experience at other retailers and it\\'s a problem. With their knowledge, it\\'s difficult to understand our format, to believe it\\'s real.\"  But next year would be different, he said.  \"We\\'re going in the right direction,\" Chkalov added. \"In the first half of next year there will be big changes for our customers.\"  As well as opening in Preston, a further three Mere outlets were planned this year -including two in Wales, in Mold and Caldicot, and another in Castleford in the north of England.  Mere has been approached for comment.  Everything in Mere is geared around keeping costs down.  Suppliers deliver straight to the shops, cutting down costs on having to store items elsewhere. Each store in the UK will have just eight staff.  Goods are stacked on pallets on the floor, with shoppers helping themselves to what they want.  The downside is this adds a bit longer to your shopping trip. In a normal supermarket, with everything unpacked on shelves it is easy to see what you\\'re looking for.

       " \"GreenPromoCode.com Offers Best Black Friday Coupons, Deals, and Discounts The Black Friday extravaganza is still a few days away, but retailers have already started promoting their discounts on products. However, this year the deals may not be as high as we enjoyed in the past, owing to the supply chain problems and inflation triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Buyers, however, do not need to worry because GreenPromoCode.com offers the best Black Friday Promo Codes, Black Friday Coupons, and Black Friday Deals this year.  Things that could be hard to find  Owing to supply chain delays, the retailers are having a hard time filling their shelves. While American President Biden assured that Walmart and Target have geared up to stock most of the products like toys, food etc., there will still be some items that would not be easy to find.  For instance, buyers might have a hard time finding the gaming consoles they like most. We saw last year, the manufacturers couldn't meet demand and this year will not be any different. The price of gaming consoles again will be high this year.  However, you may be able to get Black Friday discounts from GreenPromoCode.com.  Best Black Friday discounts  Gladly, the best Black Friday deals will be available on toys and computers this year, as stated by Adobe Digital Insights. The software firm says that they are expecting a 5 percent reduction in the price of computers and 3 percent for toys compared to last year.  Retailers are in a hurry to offload last year's toys to load up the new stuff if they get them on time. That said, shoppers could face a tough time finding the latest toys for Christmas, again due to the Covid-19 pandemic that hit the supply chain in all countries.  The positive aspect is the items that retailers have ordered and couldn't received yet. If they reach them after the holiday season, purchasers could have them at discounted prices.  Avail more discounts on toys and gadgets through GreenPromoCode's Black Friday coupons.  Retailers offering more deals  Many giant retailers have already started offering discounts on an array of products they present. Purchasers may like to shop early this year to avoid the stock issues, though retailers have assured quick restocking.  You may want to keep the receipts and check return policies for the time prices fall afterward. Best Buy and Target are offering price guarantees for initial customers, but terms apply.

       " 'Money Thousands more drivers to be hit with £200 fines in mobile phone crackdown From 2022, laws will go further to ban drivers from using their mobile phones to take photos or videos, scroll through playlists or play games, in addition to making a call or sending a text  Tougher new laws will come into force in a further crackdown on using a mobile phone behind the wheel from next year.  It is already illegal to text or make a phone call, other than in an emergency, using a hand-held device while driving.  From 2022, laws will go further to ban drivers from using their phones to take photos or videos, scroll through playlists or play games.  This will mean anyone caught using their hand-held device while driving will face a £200 fixed penalty notice and six points on their licence.  Drivers will still be able to continue using a device \\'hands-free\\' while driving, such as a sat-nav, if it\\'s secured in a cradle.  They must, however, always take responsibility for their driving and can be charged with an offence if the police find them not to be in proper control of their vehicle.  Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: \"Too many deaths and injuries occur while mobile phones are being held.  \"By making it easier to prosecute people illegally using their phone at the wheel, we are ensuring the law is brought into the 21st century while further protecting all road users.\"  Following the public consultation, the government will revise The Highway Code to explain the new measures.  It will also be more precise about the fact that being stationary in traffic counts as driving, making it clear that hand-held mobile phone use at traffic lights or in motorway jams is illegal except in very limited circumstances.  There will be an exemption to the new law for drivers making a contactless payment using their mobile phone while stationary to ensure the law keeps pace with technology.  This exemption will cover, for example, places like a drive-through restaurant or a road toll, and will only apply when payment is being made with a card reader. It will not allow motorists to make general online payments while driving.  Mary Williams OBE, chief executive of Brake - the road safety charity, said: \"Driver distraction can be deadly and using a hand-held phone at the wheel is never worth the risk. This important road safety decision by government, coinciding with Road Safety Week, is very welcomed.  \"This news is particularly welcomed by families suffering bereavement and catastrophic injury due to drivers being distracted by phones. The theme for Road Safety Week is road safety heroes - we can all be road safety heroes by giving driving our full attention.\"  The Department for Transport has also today published a study by Ipsos Mori about drivers who use mobile phones while driving.  Among other findings, the research reveals younger motorists are more likely to use a handheld device at the wheel.',\n",
       " 'In Post-GameStop Reform Push, SEC Seeks More Disclosure of Stock Lending The Securities and Exchange Commission is moving to bring greater transparency to the securities-lending market, where short-selling hedge funds borrow shares to bet against companies\\' stocks.  A new rule proposed by the SEC on Thursday would require firms that lend securities to report data on each loan to an oversight body such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority within 15 minutes of making the loan. Data on the loans would be made public.  In short selling, a trader who wants to bet against a company borrows shares of its stock, then sells them and buys them back later. That can allow them to profit if the stock\\'s price declines in the meantime. Lenders of the shares can be brokerages or asset managers, which lend securities as an additional source of revenue.  There is currently little public information about volumes and rates in the securities lending market, though private vendors collect and sell some lending data.  Potentially, a rise in demand for borrowing a particular stock could indicate that short sellers are increasingly interested in betting against that stock.  Georgetown University finance professor James Angel said the SEC\\'s proposal still wouldn\\'t provide real-time insights into the actions of short sellers. That\\'s because there is typically a delay of two business days between when short sellers place their bets against companies and when the brokerages serving those short sellers need to borrow shares to underpin those bets, according to Mr. Angel.  Still, he said the SEC\\'s proposal could benefit investors by allowing the firms that manage their savings, such as pension funds or exchange-traded funds, to earn more money when lending securities.  \"This is long overdue,\" he said. \"This is a great step towards transparency and equality in the stock-loan market.\"  Congress ordered the SEC to increase disclosures of securities lending in the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law. The agency didn\\'t act until this year\\'s meme-stock frenzy brought fresh scrutiny of short selling. Individual investors banded together on social media to pump up stocks like GameStop that had attracted heavy interest from short sellers.  The Wall Street Journal reported in February that the SEC was considering such a step, following the trading frenzy in GameStop Corp. and other so-called meme stocks.  In a statement, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said the agency\\'s five commissioners -- which include three Democrats and two Republicans -- had unanimously agreed to release the proposal for public comment. The rule must still be finalized by the SEC, after the regulator reviews feedback from Wall Street and members of the public.  \"In today\\'s fast-moving financial markets, it\\'s important that market participants have access to fair, accurate, and timely information,\" Mr. Gensler said. \"I believe this proposal would bring securities lending out of the dark.\"  Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexander.osipovich@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  19-11-21 0300GMT',\n",
       " 'Money Lidl becomes UK\\'s best paying supermarket with new pay rate of £10.10 an hour Longer-serving staff will see their pay rates rise to £11.40 and £12.25 outside and inside London respectively, depending on length of service, while all other basic-rate workers will see their pay jump to £10.10  Discount grocer Lidl has increased the rates of pay for new shop floor workers to more than £10 an hour.  Bosses said entry-level wages will rise from £9.50 to £10.10 an hour outside London and from £10.85 to £11.30 in the capital from March next year.  Longer-serving staff will see their pay rates also rise to £11.40 and £12.25 outside and inside London respectively, depending on length of service.  The announcement represents a pay rise of more than six per cent for some of the 21,000 Lidl staff members set to receive a hike.  Staff members over the age of 23 will benefit from 60p per hour more than the National Living Wage.  The supermarket claimed it means Lidl is now the highest-paying grocer in the country, adding that this was in recognition of the hard work of staff during the pandemic.  Bosses said the extra £18million spend by the business on the new wages equates to £50million invested in hourly wage increases over the past five years.  It follows a £200 bonus to all frontline workers this year, alongside £150 gift vouchers for all staff in 2020 during the pandemic.  \"At Lidl, our frontline colleagues are the backbone of our business,\" Lidl chief executive, Christian Härtnagel said.  \"They have worked tirelessly over the past 18 months of the Covid-19 crisis and are integral to our future success.  \"We have ambitious plans to grow our business across Great Britain, and to do that we need to ensure we attract and look after the best talent at every level of our business.  \"This year we feel incredibly lucky to be in a position as a business to go even further by making this significant investment in our incredible workforce, which will make us the best paying supermarket in the UK.\"  In June, Lidl announced Lidl to open 50 new stores this year creating 2,000 jobs -see full list  as part of an expansion drive that would also pave the way for 2,000 extra jobs.  The German discounter announced the openings as part of a pledge to reach 1,000 stores by 2022.  It said £1.3bn will be invested into the project, which includes opening 50 new stores over the next 12 months.  All new stores will also feature solar panels and electric vehicle charging points, a spokesman added.  The grocer\\'s \\'wish list\\' of areas features over 1,000 towns where it is hoping to secure rent deals with landlords.  However, the primary focus for the first 50 openings is town centres, edge of city centres, retail parks and metropolitan locations, Lidl said.',\n",
       " 'Money Barclays customers told they\\'ve missed mortgage payments despite paying in full Barclays customers are furious after they were wrongly recorded as having missed mortgage payments. A bad mark on your credit file can last six years and makes it harder to take out a loan, credit card or switch your mortgage  Barclays customers say they\\'ve been incorrectly marked down as having missed mortgage payments -despite paying in full.  Some people have claimed this happened to them despite having a payment holiday in place with the bank.  And in some cases, customers have complained that the marks on their credit file haven\\'t been removed.  A bad mark on your credit file can last six years and makes it harder to take out a loan, credit card or switch your mortgage.  JN, from Edinburgh, found Barclays had posted three missed payments on his Experian account over the last six years, despite him never have been late paying.  He said he only discovered the black marks after checking his credit file online.  Are you a Barclays customer who has experienced a similar problem Let us know: levi.winchester@reachplc.com  They told The Guardian, which first uncovered the errors: \"What I find most extraordinary is that at no stage did Barclays write to me or contact me about this.\"  Another customer, GW from Surrey, said a black mark was reported on their file despite agreeing a six month payment holiday during the coronavirus pandemic.  Since then, he says he has resumed his monthly payments and has been overpaying to make up for the holiday -but 13 missed payments have been registered on his credit file.  Barclays disputes this and says only three months of paused payments were agreed. The Financial Ombudsman is now reviewing the case.  GW said: \"It\\'s a nightmare. Due to them I have been unable to move my credit card balance to a cheaper deal.\"  In another case, one reader said they were given £300 compensation by Barclays after three months of mortgage payments weren\\'t collected following an administration error.  This happened in 2019 after a routine rate change to his mortgage term -but the customer says he recently discovered four missed payments on his credit file.  The Guardian says the error appears to have affected former customers of Woolwich Building Society, which was taken over by Barclays in 2000, who have made changes to their mortgage term.  It isn\\'t clear how many people have experienced similar issues.  A Barclays spokesperson told the newspaper: \"We take the responsibility of reporting accurate data of customers\\' credit reference information extremely seriously.  \"As soon as we are alerted to any discrepancy we will work swiftly to review and resolve the situation.  \"Of the recent individual cases brought to our attention, the majority have already been resolved and where errors were identified corrective action taken to ensure accurate reporting.  \"We are currently reviewing the remaining two active cases and will shortly provide both customers with a resolution proposal.\"',\n",

As part of these improvements, ED has launched a limited-timePublic Service Loan Forgiveness Limited Waiver Opportunitythat will run through Oct. 31, 2022, allowing eligible borrowers to receive credit for past payments made on loans that would otherwise not qualify under the PSLF program.Thismove by ED to improve the PSLF programfollowsa recent comment letter, led by Attorney General Bonta, that urged ED to take robust action to fix the broken PSLF program.Below, Attorney General Bonta provides additional information regarding the newly established waiver, including eligibility, and steps borrowers can take in order to utilize the program.  \"Many of our brave public servants have dedicated their lives to protecting our communities on the promise of the PSLF program, only to be denied the loan forgiveness that they are entitled to. Our teachers, nurses, first responders, service members, and many others have been required to serve at the forefront of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet they have repeatedly been let down by a failed system,\"said Attorney General Bonta. \"We are extremely pleased to see the Biden Administration\\'s progress on fixingthe brokenPSLF program and its commitment to making good on our nation\\'s promise to those who have devoted themselves to serving others. I encourage all public servants who hold federal student loan debt to take advantage of the new PSLF Limited Waiver Opportunity and pursue the loan forgiveness that you are entitled to.\"  How to Check if Your Payments are Eligible Under the Limited PSLF Waiver  Under the temporary rules, any prior payment made will count as a qualifying payment, regardless of loan type, repayment plan, or whether the payment was made in full or on time. All you need is qualifying employment. This temporary change will apply to student loan borrowers with Direct Loans, those who have already consolidated into the Direct Loan Program, and those who consolidate into the Direct Loan Program byOct. 31, 2022.

       " \"ROP What pension options are available? I'm approaching retirement and due to stop work early next year. I've started to look at what income my pension will give me and I'm a bit confused by the information I am getting from my pension company. I have three funds - all of which are private pensions - which are now worth about £400,000 in total. What are my options?  Phil Beck of Smith & Pinching responds:  Approaching retirement is a critical time for your financial planning. Decisions made at this point may affect the rest of your life. I strongly recommend that you get independent financial advice before taking any action.  Accessing your pension savings can happen in a number of ways. Firstly, you are normally allowed to take up to a quarter of your pension savings at the start of your retirement as a tax-free cash sum. You don't have to\\xa0if you have no specific need for cash at this point.  An income from your pension fund can be provided in two principal ways: an annuity or flexi-access drawdown.  An annuity is a plan purchased with your pension savings that provides a guaranteed income for life, however long you may live. It's a one-off decision requiring an initial outlay and is generally irrevocable (although some protection for dying in the early years of the plan can be built in). If you don't take your tax-free cash entitlement at the outset, you won't be able to take it later. Annuity rates have struggled for some years now, but they do provide security for the future.  Flexi-access drawdown involves drawing directly from the pension fund, leaving the remainder invested for potential future growth. It gives you flexibility in how much income you take at different stages of your retirement and means that your money can continue to grow. Also, you usually have the option of taking your tax-free cash entitlement in stages. However, it won't give you any guarantees and poor market performance can adversely affect the value of your fund. What it will give, however, is the chance to leave any unspent pension to your heirs\\xa0if you die early.  Flexi-access drawdown has become the most popular pension income option, but does require you to manage both the ongoing investment and level of withdrawals to ensure that your money doesn't run out.\\xa0You can, in fact, combine annuities and flexi-access drawdown, either concurrently or at different stages of retirement.  Please get independent advice at this important stage. The right solution for you will depend on a wide range of factors.  Any opinions expressed in this article do not constitute advice. The value of an investment and the income from it could go down as well as up. The return at the end of the investment period is not guaranteed and you may get back less than you originally invested.  For more information, please visit www.smith-pinching.co.uk\",\n",
       " 'Appharvest Inc. - How to bring ESG into your 401(k) * Click here to view this document in its original format  How to bring ESG into your 401(k)  How to bring ESG into your 401(k)  There\\'s been some debate as to whether 401(k)s should include ESG-focused funds. Opponents have said that, absent a global standard for measuring ESG performance, including ESG funds in 401(k)s would be a \"breach of fiduciary responsibility.\"  But proponents argue that as interest in ESG grows - investors pumped $51.1 billion into U.S. sustainable funds last year, more than double the total in 2019 - individuals should be able to add these funds to their retirement-savings plans if they so desire.  Last spring the Department of Labor announced it would cease to enforce a Trump-era rule that required 401(k) plans to base decisions solely economic factors, which means individuals could see increased ESG options in their employee-sponsored retirement plans in the coming years.  But investors eager to incorporate ESG funds into their retirement plans might not have to wait for that to happen. As the Wall Street Journalreports, there are still ways to feather a nest egg with impact investments. Here are a few ideas.  * Take a closer look at your plan\\'s portfolio holdings. When you examine a fund\\'s portfolio holdings, check to see if it includes any of the same stocks held by big-name ESG funds like Parnassus Core Equity. If you see a lot of overlap, that one could be a winner. If you want to take a deeper dive, the research provider MSCI Inc. ranks individual stocks and funds on a continuum ranging from \"leader\" to \"laggard.\"  * Ask if your plan offers a self-directed brokerage window. Some employee-sponsored plans will allow you to buy stocks outside the plan\\'s offerings and include them in the same tax-deferred account. If you go this route, be sure to ask about any transaction fees so there\\'s no sticker shock.  * Consider setting up a sustainable supplement. If your 401(k) just doesn\\'t offer adequate ESG options, you can still set up a traditional or Roth IRA for those investments. Experts advise starting off with a broadly focused ESG fund - as opposed to one dedicated to a single issue like renewable -because these portfolios are more likely to match the performance of major market indexes like the S&P 500.

       " 'RealEstate Study: Fall is when home buyers can find the best deals Each individual home buyer needs to determine when it\\'s the right time to purchase a property based on their financial situation and lifestyle. At the same time, buyers typically hope to find that ideal moment when they can find a home that matches their hopes and dreams for the best possible price.  Spring and summer are typically the most competitive seasons for buyers - and some look for a home in the winter. But fall is the time when buyers will find the best deals of the year, according to Realtor.com.  According to the listing site\\'s analysis, buyers face 18 percent less competition in the ideal buying week in their market compared with the peak week in summer and 6 percent less competition than an average week.  Realtor.com estimates that buyers can save as much as $10,000 on a median-priced home during the \"best\" week compared with the summer peak. Listings are up 31 percent on average during the ideal week compared with an average week during the year.  Homes stay on the market a bit longer during the best week, which means buyers will have an average of seven extra days to consider whether they want to make an offer.  Depending on where they\\'re shopping for a home, buyers will see a sweet spot - more homes for sale, lower prices and less competition from other buyers - sometime between this week and Oct. 17.  The optimal week to shop for a home in most markets across the United States is the week of Oct. 3-9, according to Realtor.com\\'s analysis.  But, like pretty much everything about real estate, the best week varies by location. For buyers in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Denver, Detroit, Minneapolis and Portland, the optimal week to shop is this week.  In the D.C. metro area, the best week was Sept. 19. Realtor.com anticipated active listings would be up 14 percent compared with the peak week of the year, and that the number of days a home takes to sell would be up by 49 percent. The median listing price for homes was anticipated to be 4.8 percent lower than the peak week.  The peak for home buyer demand is usually in July. Realtor.com anticipates approximately 705,000 listings to be on the market in October across the United States, which is about 100,000 more than in July, as long as 2021 follows the typical seasonal pattern.  More home sellers tend to reduce their listing price during the best week to buy, with an average of 7 percent of sellers dropping their price. That could mean about 50,000 homes nationally will have a reduced price. The analysis is based on listing data since 2018 that compares available homes and the number of buyers in the market.

       " 'Money,News Money,Aldi,Retail AISLE BE DAMNED Aldi opens first checkout-free supermarket in the UK - and it means no more queuing SHOPPERS could soon avoid Aldi\\'s super-speedy checkouts as the supermarket has revealed its first store without them.  The discounter is testing out its first checkout-free branch in London and there\\'s no self-service till either.  Instead Aldi is testing out a smartphone app that means you scan as you enter and can just walk out after.  You won\\'t even need to scan the fruit, veg and other groceries as you shop to avoid queueing to pay at the checkout.  The charges are made automatically and a receipt is sent for their grocery shop via email.  Users of the app, which is being tested out by staff before it\\'s trialled with customers, can set up the debit or credit card they want to be charged online.  Giles Hurley, chief executive of Aldi in the UK and Ireland, said: \"We are always looking to redefine what it means to be a discount retailer, and the technology involved in this trial will give us a wealth of learnings.\"  \"We are really excited to be testing this concept that will enable customers to pick from our range of quality products, all available at unbeatable prices, then leave the store without having to pay at a till.\"  Staff will still be employed at the supermarket, with the same number as its smaller Aldi Local stores.  Aldi shoppers often can\\'t keep up with how fast the checkouts are and the grocer has claimed that they are 40% quicker than rivals.  The company has even joked that its staff are \"faster than 5G\" thanks to using extra big barcodes to get items through quickly.  But shoppers can always ask staff to slow down if they need to.  The super-speeds will no longer be an issue for those giving the checkout-free shops a test.  Aldi is not the only supermarket to ditch checkouts and turn to technology to put an end to queuing at tills.  Tesco launched its first checkout-free store at the start of the year at its headquarters after successful trials, and then its first for the public over the summer.  Online retailer Amazon has gone checkout-free at its first bricks and mortar grocery stores, Amazon Fresh.  Other supermarkets have apps that can help you beat the queues by scanning items as you shop, though you still have to pay at the till points.  Tesco has \"Scan as you Shop\" and M&S\\' \"Mobile Pay Go\", while Lidl is testing the service through its Lidl go app.  At Sainsbury\\'s you can use the SmartShop app as a self-scanner and shoppers will have to use this to get discounts after a shake-up of the supermarket\\'s loyalty scheme.

       " 'Business The ravages of inflation affect every one of us Outlook  Who is hit hardest by inflation? While rising prices tend to be bad news for many of us, the way it manifests will be different from group to group. As Alistair McQueen, head of savings and retirement at Aviva, put it yesterday: \"The 3.2 per cent headline rise in the consumer prices index (CPI) is big. It is also an average, and none of us are \\'average\\'. Different personal spending habits will drive a different personal experience of inflation.\"  By Aviva\\'s calculation, it is preretirees, aged 50 to 64, who are being hit hardest by price rises. This age group tends to spend more on the categories that are experiencing the biggest inflation, such as restaurants, hotels, recreation and transport.  Another group is savers, including those who were able to take advantage of being stuck at home to put away some extra cash. \"Many households were able to build up their savings during the repeated lockdowns,\" said Jason Hollands, managing director of Bestinvest. \"But the surge in inflation threatens to erode the real value of these cash war chests.\"  He likened inflation to a \"rat tucking in to a piece of cheese\", leaving savers with less to show for their hard work, especially while interest rates remain in the doldrums.  Spare a thought, too, for small business owners. While yesterday\\'s ONS figures measured the price which the end-customer pays, businesses are facing their own costs including raw materials, labour shortages and supply disruption. They then have to figure out how much of it they can absorb.  Ruth Bradford of Bristol-based  The Little Black and White Book Project, a maker of children\\'s books and gifts, explained her conundrum: \"I\\'m trying desperately not to increase the prices of my products despite being slammed by increased material and manufacturing costs across the board, but I feel it will be inevitable.  It\\'s a double whammy for us business owners as we have to cover our own higher living costs while also keeping our offering affordable for our customers. It\\'s a no-win situation.\"  And of course there are the workers. Rising prices come at a particularly tight time, with those in low-paid positions already facing a cut to their universal credit next month, while the Government\\'s national insurance hike will put a further squeeze on household budgets.  Is there any good news? There\\'s a glimmer of hope for pensioners worried about the conversion of the triple-lock on the state pension to a double-lock. If next month\\'s CPI figure surpasses 2.5 per cent, it will determine the pension increase for April. With August\\'s number having come in above expectations, that now looks more likely. This, however, will only be of any use to pensioners if living costs haven\\'t further outstripped the rise by the spring.  Businesses are also facing other costs including labour shortages and disruption to supply',\n",
       " \"CHAIRMAN NEAL OPENING STATEMENT FOR SUBTITLE B AT MARKUP OF THE BUILD BACK BETTER ACT; House Ways and Means Committee News Release We now turn to Budget Reconciliation Legislative Recommendations Relating to Retirement which will make investments to improve Americans' long-term financial security. I'm proud of this Committee's bipartisan record of accomplishment in the area of retirement policy, and we have an opportunity here to build on those achievements and further enhance workers' opportunities to save.  Our country currently faces a retirement income crisis. Nearly one-third of Americans have no retirement savings at all, and about half of working-age households risk being unable to maintain their current standard of living after retiring.  We know that having an employer-sponsored retirement plan is key to preparing for retirement, but nearly half of American private sector employees work for an employer that doesn't offer a retirement plan.  This subtitle includes an automatic IRA proposal that requires employers that have been in existence for at least two years, do not sponsor a retirement plan, and employ five or more people to automatically enroll those employees in IRAs or 401(k)-type plans. To offset administrative costs, employers would receive a tax credit.  Current law includes a nonrefundable tax credit - called the Saver's Credit - for eligible taxpayers who make elective deferrals to tax-favored retirement plans or contributions to IRAs. The investments we're considering would make the Saver's Credit refundable, so that those without any income tax liability receive a benefit. The proposal also would require the credit amount to be contributed directly to a tax-favored retirement account, in effect, acting as a matching contribution for savers.  Automatic IRAs and Saver's Credit enhancements would dramatically expand retirement savings in the United States. According to recent analysis commissioned by the American Retirement Association, implementing these proposals could add up to $7.0 trillion in additional retirement savings over a 10-year period - and create more than 62 million new retirement savers.  These investments would also help address inequities in retirement saving. Automatic IRAs would particularly benefit Hispanic, Asian, and Black populations in the United States, as they are less likely to have access to work-sponsored retirement plans. It's estimated that the Auto IRA and Saver's Credit enhancements would result in 7.0 million new Black savers and 10.8 million new Latino and Latina savers. Over 98 percent of new savers make less than $100,000 per year.  Now is the time to confront these issues head-on - the longer we wait, the worse the crisis will become, and millions more Americans will find themselves in untenable circumstances in their later years.  I urge all of you to vote in favor of these impactful retirement provisions.  I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Brady, for purposes of an opening statement.

       " 'Are you in a dud super fund? Why you should look before you leap | Making Money Superannuation watchdog APRA has just delivered its verdict on the performance of the nation\\'s 80 MySuper accounts.  These are the default funds designed to provide low fees and basic levels of insurance.  If you haven\\'t given your employer instructions about which fund you\\'d like the boss\\'s compulsory contributions paid into, it\\'s a fair bet your retirement savings are in a MySuper product.  APRA reviewed these funds as part of the Your Future, Your Super reforms introduced in the 2020-21 federal budget.  It will be an annual event, and undoubtedly one that super funds won\\'t look forward to with any great relish.  That\\'s because if a MySuper fund fails APRA\\'s test, the fund is required to write to members by the end of September, and suggest they take their money elsewhere because the fund is an underperformer.  On the plus side, only 13 MySuper accounts have been assessed by APRA as \"underperformers\".  That\\'s considerably less that some pundits were expecting.  But you don\\'t have to wait to hear from your fund to know if your super account is among those that failed the test.  The Tax Office website has a YourSuper comparison tool that makes it very public which funds performed and which underperformed.  The tool also shows the fees and investment returns over three, five and seven years for each MySuper product.  None of us want to be in a super fund labelled as a dud. But before bailing out of an underperforming fund, there are a few things to consider.  The first is that APRA\\'s performance test is complex. In particular, it looks at the fund\\'s performance in relation to it\\'s investment strategy.  So some of the funds that copped a \"fail\" result delivered much higher returns than others that passed.  This is why it makes more sense to look before you leap. It\\'s worth checking the returns your fund has notched up over time. Then check how it compares to others.  The YourSuper tool allows you to do this.  That way you can get an idea of whether you fund is a continual chain-dragger on returns or if it charges relatively high fees.  Switching to a new fund can be a good idea if it helps you enjoy a bigger nest egg in retirement.  However, it will mean going through the process of selecting a fund, transferring your super savings from the old fund to a new one, and your letting your boss know the details of the new fund.  It\\'s not a hard process, but it\\'s not something any of us want to go through every year.  So take the time to be sure you\\'re happy with a new fund - or comfortable sticking with your old one.

       " 'business Building retirement income from sources Early in the retirement planning discussion, I often share my opinion on the challenges someone may encounter as they transition from working to retirement. The conversations typically begin with the way in which someone views the path towards successful retirement. Too often, the focus is on how much money someone has or needs to have saved to last them for the rest of their life.  Rather than viewing retirement through the savings mentality, I encourage people to think of retirement through the income perspective. It\\'s wonderful to have accumulated and saved assets during working years. However, if the purchasing power of those assets erodes overtime by inflation and increased costs of living, even a substantial starting balance of retirement assets may not be enough. This concept of \"protecting\" what has already been accumulated often leads someone to become too conservative too early. Think of your accumulated assets as base from which to draw income over time and understand there will likely be a need for additional growth of that asset base during retirement years.  Once someone gets on board with an income approach, the next hurdle is determining how much to take from each source of funds. A good solution is to start with someone\\'s \"guaranteed\" sources of income and move to the variable sources of income. Some may choose to label these sources as non-market dependent sources vs. market dependent sources. Non-market dependent items include items such as Social Security, pensions, required minimum distributions, annuitized investments, rental income, or farm income. These sources serve as a base to build ongoing income in retirement and are not subject to the same volatility that impacts traditional investment portfolios. This is not to say these sources are without any risks, but they are more predictable over shorter time periods.  Market dependent sources include retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, IRAs and Roth IRAs. Other examples include variable annuities and traditional brokerage investment accounts. Based on the investment mix, a retiree and their advisor can identify a sustainable target amount that can be withdrawn annually for income without jeopardizing the long-term focus of the portfolio. The goal is to draw income as needed without substantially depleting principal amounts during the early retirement years. Other considerations for tax purposes may influence the timing and amounts to take from various sources that are tax-deferred, tax-free, or taxable subject to capital gains rates.  Putting everything together, a retiree can have confidence that the income needed to maintain their desired lifestyle will be available for the duration of their lives. As circumstances change, it may be necessary to review the income composition and adjust accordingly. Looking at retirement through the lens of income rather than savings can help someone avoid the pitfalls of becoming too conservative too quickly.  As always, please be sure to consult your financial professional regarding your unique situation.  Ruedi is a financial advisor with Savant Wealth Management, Bloomington.  CREDIT: CHRIS RUEDI',\n",
       " 'Nation Cost of living smacks retirees THE rising cost of living is hitting retirees harder than the rest of Australia\\'s population, a new report says.  A comfortable retirement now requires $63,352 a year for couples and $44,818 for singles, according to the latest ASFA Retirement Standard from the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia.  These numbers rose 0.8 and 0.9 per cent respectively in the June quarter, but some common retiree costs had much bigger price increases, with fruit up 4.7 per cent, vegetables up 5.5 per cent and private health insurance premiums rising 2.7 per cent.  ASFA CEO Martin Fahy said retiree cost increases had accelerated after Covid-19 had previously delayed price rises for things such as health insurance.  \"The lived experience of retirees is different to that of the wider population in terms of price increases,\" Dr Fahy said.  \"They are particularly exposed to the basics - food, petrol, health insurance etc.  \"They tend not to benefit from areas where we see low inflation or price decreases,\" such as childcare, education, whitegoods and clothing.  In the past 12 months petrol prices had jumped 27.3 per cent while medical and hospital services rose 6.7 per cent, ASFA found.  \"Retirees are also exposed to aged care and health care costs which are both running ahead of normal inflation,\" Dr Fahy said.  \"None of us wants to have the retirement of our grandparents.\" Dr Fahy said future retirees would be affected by last year\\'s superannuation early withdrawal scheme that left one million Australians with no super.  He said the $38 billion withdrawn in that scheme had a long-term cost of $100 billion because that money would no longer be growing inside super and people who withdrew had missed the stockmarket\\'s strong recovery since mid-2020.  Financial strategist Theo Marinis said Australia\\'s current annual inflation rate of 3.8 per cent \"understates the real cost of living\".  However, he said many of his clients were telling him they were not spending as much as they were before the pandemic.  \"Because we are locked down, it\\'s hard to even go interstate these days,\" Mr Marinis said.  \"Generally, people are doing okay because we haven\\'t got as many options to spend.\" Mr Marinis said a retirement income of more than $50,000 a year was achievable for many couples because the age pension paid about $34,000 and those with the average combined super balance near $400,000 combined could expect to earn an extra $20,000.  \"Even people with quite modest balances of super can achieve about $1000 a week,\" he said.  Another option for retirees was to draw down more of their super during the early years of retirement then use the government\\'s pension loan scheme - a reverse mortgage that dips into equity in their home - to top up income. \"The Pension Loans Scheme gives you an additional 50 per cent more than the age pension.\"',\n",
       " 'News One last generous act to change many lives The moment Willis Jacques called into the offices of Sproal and Associates lawyers on St John Street, nobody knew it, but the lives of countless Tasmanians changed forever.  Months later, with Ms Jacques having died and her estate having been ordered, The Examiner\\'s Winter Relief Appeal has received its largest ever single donation and blown away its record total.  Ms Jacques bequeathed much of her legacy to charities, reserving a mammoth $150,000 for the Winter Relief Appeal.  Ms Jacques had entered the office in the twilight of her life, and in anticipation of her death, looking to get her affairs in order, part of which was deciding who would be the beneficiary of her estate. It ended up being defined by selflessness.  Such was Ms Jacques\\' generosity she left legacies to people who cared for her at her nursing home, before leaving the majority of her estate to charities.  Executor of her estate, Barry Sproal from Sproal and associates, said it was one of the most mind blowing examples of generosity he had seen.  \"Legacies to charities aren\\'t unusual, but it\\'s unusual that it ends up being this sort of an amount,\" he said.  Mr Sproal said he believed Ms Jacques had selected the Winter Relief Appeal because of its obvious translation into the Launceston community.  \"[The donations] get applied immediately, which is I think is what she was hoping would happen - that there\\'s an immediate benefit to those who need it,\" he said.  For the four charities the Winter Relief Appeal supports, the sheer amount of the donation will have obvious ramifications on how they provide their services over the coming months.  Launceston Benevolent Society chief executive Rod Spinks was taken aback upon hearing how much the donation was and said the charity would be able to assist more people than it had previously thought it would be able to.  \"We\\'ll now be able to extend our social worker\\'s hours, and provide support in that way,\" he said.  \"This is just tremendous and something we wouldn\\'t have budgeted for.\"  Both City Mission chief executive Stephen Brown and Salvation Army spokesperson Major Brad Watson said the donation was \"significant\".  \"Every time we get an extra amount of money, that\\'s an extra night someone stays in housing, an extra night they\\'re not in a family violence situation, or an extra meal they get. We are extremely grateful,\" Mr Watson said.  St Vincent de Paul Society Tasmania chief executive Lara Alexander said the donation would go a \"very long way in supporting those vulnerable in our community\".  \"With a gesture like this you can only imagine how many people it is going to touch and make such a great difference in their lives,\" she said.  \"It shows so much about the legacy of a person in a community. You can be any person out there, and the legacy you leave can touch so many people.\"',\n",
       " 'WSJ Pro Prudential Financial Allocates $200 Million for Diverse Private-Equity Managers; Financial-services company will focus on limited-partner stakes in firms with substantial ownership stakes or management by women and minorities Prudential Financial Inc. said it has committed $200 million to back new private-equity firms headed by diverse managers.  The financial-services company Wednesday said investments will focus on limited-partner stakes in firms with substantial ownership or management by women and minorities, especially those raising capital for first or second funds.  The company said providing capital to early-stage managers adds to its existing investments in later-stage alternative asset firms owned and operated by women and minorities. Prudential currently oversees about $1.2 billion in assets under management in established private-equity funds, hedge funds and real-estate vehicles whose management has substantial or full ownership by ethnic minorities or women, according to an announcement about the new strategy.  Prudential will be funding the new effort through its general account, according to Cherrise Cederqvist, vice president at PGIM Investments, the asset-management business within Prudential Financial that leads the DEI Portfolio program. The $200 million fund will generally allocate between $5 million and $25 million at a time to managers, she said.  The group is already in discussions with potential candidates for the portfolio through introductions from other Prudential investing groups such as its private capital or real-estate group, Ms. Cederqvist said. It isn\\'t clear how many managers will receive funding from the new vehicle or when the group will make its first investment for the portfolio.  Prudential decided to start the effort because of the continuing need for funding for first- and second-time funds.  \"We\\'ve read the research and seen there is a particular hurdle that women and people of color face when they are launching their early funds,\" Ms. Cederqvist said.  A report funded by The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and published in early 2019 found that women-owned firms represented just 5.2% of all private-equity firms, while minority-owned firms accounted for just 3.8%. Women-owned firms accounted for just 3.4% of total assets managed by private-equity firms versus 3.8% that minority-owned firms represented.  Prudential\\'s new program reflects increased attention among institutional investors on supporting emerging managers that come from diverse backgrounds. In May, for example, Massachusetts\\' largest state pension manager laid out plans to increase engagement with diverse emerging managers while also stepping up reporting requirements on diversity and inclusion by existing investment managers.  \"By supporting smaller funds, hopefully you increase the pipeline of people you can invest with and employ down the road, so you can change the industry,\" said Ms. Cederqvist. \"But also, so often investment processes will exclude the people who are newer. When you do that you leave a lot on the table.\"  Write to Laura Cooper at laura.cooper@wsj.com and Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com',\n",
       " 'Money,News Money,Energy bills PAYING THE PRICE Brits\\' energy bills set to soar under government\\'s \\'green gas\\' hydrogen homes plan BRITS\\' energy bills are set to soar under the government\\'s \"green gas\" hydrogen homes plan.  The Government is attempting to fund its ambition to produce 5GW of hydrogen for use in heavy industry, transport and home heating by 2030, according to reports.  The plans could see bills rise for everyone according to The Telegraph - despite only 10 per cent of the country\\'s homes set to be heated with the greener gas.  The scheme will be modelled on subsidies that helped to boost the UK\\'s offshore wind industry over the past decade.  And the government expects hydrogen to provide enough energy for just 67,000 homes, or 0.2 per cent, by 2030.  This figure is then set to rise to meet up to 10 per cent of domestic heating demand by 2035, the Telegraph reports.  But some experts have blasted this scheme as bill payers could be forced to fork out for the development of \"pointless\" technology.  Decisions over whether these hydrogen energy sources will replace gas boilers will be made by 2026.  But new rules have been put in place already that will stop developers from installing gas boilers in new-build homes within three years.  Developers will stop installing them in homes from 2023, two years earlier than first announced.  Hydrogen can be made either using methane, with the emissions captured and stored, classed as \"blue\", or through electrolysis, considered \"green\" if renewable electricity is used.  The gas will most likely be used in industries like shipping, steel making and fertiliser use - which will struggle to decarbonise.  As a result, the use of hydrogen for home heating is expected to be concentrated near industrial clusters and not for the general population.  Juliet Phillips, an energy expert at think tank E3G, said: \"The risk is that gas payers end up paying for what\\'s used in a few industrial clusters.  \"That doesn\\'t seem very fair or progressive.\"  Sir John Armitt, chairman of the national infrastructure commission, said a carbon price on natural gas would be needed to incentivise its use across the economy.  He said: \"The real challenge is that it\\'s likely to be more expensive than natural gas.\".  It comes as another blow to household finances after Ofgem announced earlier this month it would increase average energy prices for 11million household by £139.  The regulator hiked the price cap to £1,277 from £1,277 - the highest since the cap launched in January 2019 - and bills will go up on October 1.

       " 'Stockpiling cash can be hazardous to your portfolio When it comes to financial security, it\\'s comforting to know that you have adequate cash reserves to tap when you need them. But there\\'s also a downside to stockpiling cash: It can drag down your portfolio\\'s returns over the long haul.  Sure, having a rainy day fund can help you survive financial jams, such as an unexpected car repair or job loss. But cash really shouldn\\'t play a big role in investment accounts meant to fund long-term goals like retirement. \"Cash becomes a drag on returns really quick,\" says Kristin McKenna, managing director at Darrow Wealth Management.  Weigh short-term needs against long-term goals to find an optimal cash position. Personal finance pros recommend a \"bucket\" approach that allocates cash over three different time frames.  A zero-cash allocation isn\\'t crazy. Once you have buckets one and two funded and can survive financial Armageddon, you likely have enough protection to invest aggressively with bucket three.  Bucket 1: Emergency fund. You need cash savings for emergencies, such as an unexpected health care bill. View your emergency bucket \"as your personal safety net when life throws you a curveball,\" says Judith Ward, senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price. Single-income households should have six to 12 months of regular expenses set aside. For dual-income families, three to six months should suffice.  It makes sense for retirees to build a cash cushion of one to two years of living expenses, so that they can tap their emergency fund to ride out a market decline without having to sell retirement savings at depressed prices. \"It\\'s about protecting your long-term assets,\" Ward says.  Bucket 2: Major expenses or intermediate-term goals. If a big-ticket purchase such as a new car or the down payment on a new home is on the horizon, you should have the money socked away for it, too. You can\\'t afford to risk money you\\'ll need in a few years in the stock market. High-yield savings or money market accounts - or even conservative short- or intermediate-term bond funds - are good choices for this goals-based bucket.  Bucket 3: Investments. For money earmarked for the long term, the less cash the better. \"We don\\'t see cash as having a place in an investment portfolio,\" says McKenna, who recommends no more than 2%. Even a 5% to 10% cash weighting can act as a headwind.  To maximize long-term returns, emulate the low cash holdings favored by fund managers. The seven nations with the biggest government pension funds (a group that includes the U.S.) had average cash positions of 4% in 2019, UBS data show. Target-date funds from Vanguard, which get more conservative as you near retirement, hold about 1% cash in portfolios that target retirement in as little as five years.

       " 'Money B&M pays £5,000 to worker who says he was harassed because of disability Harvey Spence alleges he was excluded from conversations, subjected to derogatory remarks, and constantly told that no other company would ever employ him  A former B&M Bargains worker who says he was bullied by staff because of his disability has been awarded £5,000 in a settlement case.  Harvey Spence, who has a learning disability and lives in east Belfast, raised a disability harassment claim against B&M Retail Limited after claiming he was bullied on the shop floor.  Spence said he worked for B&M for 18 months in a stock-filling role and had enjoyed the job.  However, he said that changed when he received \"disability harassment\" from some of his colleagues.  Today, B&M Bargains, agreed to pay the former employee £5,000 without admission of liability.  Harvey Spence claims he was excluded from conversations, subjected to derogatory remarks, was constantly called names and was verbally abused.  \"I liked going out to work and earning my own money, it was important to me,\" he said.  \"After a year in my job, some new people I worked with started being horrible to me and it became really hard and very upsetting. I dreaded going to work.  \"Some of the people I worked with wouldn\\'t speak to me at all and others would tell me to go away by saying horrible things, they used really bad language and called me names.  \"I found it hard to stand up for myself and in the end I had to leave my job as it was making me feel very sick.  \"I got so worried about how they would treat me if I went back in. I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever be able to get another job because I\\'m really afraid other people will treat me like that again.\"  Dr Evelyn Collins, chief executive of the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland, expressed concern at Spence\\'s experience.  She said the 37.3 per cent employment rate for disabled people in Northern Ireland is the lowest of all UK regions.  \"This needs to improve,\" she said.  \"Harvey\\'s experience at work highlights that much remains to be done to challenge barriers to employment for many disabled people and to ensure they can secure and retain paid employment.  \"Employers have a responsibility to provide and promote a good and harmonious working environment. Harvey did not experience that, he felt he had no option but to go off on sick leave and then it appears that no-one contacted him to check if he was OK or to offer support.  \"This is exactly why employers must have procedures and policies in place to allow them to deal promptly and seriously with complaints of discrimination or harassment, and ensure that their staff know how to access these and that their managers are appropriately trained to use them.\"  B&M Bargains has been approached for comment.',\n",

From the lows of 7511 in March 2020, the Nifty 50 is in touching distance of 16000. Over the last 12 months, both Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex are up by nearly 40 per cent. Several individual stocks across industries have run-up a lot and long term investors who showed patience stands rewarded.  However, besides the risk inherent to equities, there is another risk that you as an Indian investor should not ignore. Your portfolio is exposed to geographical risk if all your funds are invested in Indian market. It is, therefore, better to bring in geographical diversification to your portfolio by investing across different economies.  And, which could be a better option than investing in the growth engine of the global economy - the US. To invest in US stock from India, it is not a complex affair anymore. Almost similar to buying stocks of Reliance, CDSL or Zomato, you can buy shares of Tesla, Amazon or Facebook sitting from your home or office.  What you need is a brokerage platform that has all the back-end processes in place to help you input your buy or sell orders on the US stock exchanges. The good news is such an arrangement is already in place and the process to open a US trading account is super easy. \"Anyone can simply open an account with a broker which provides access to global investing on its platform. The investor can complete the digital KYC verification process with ID proof and address proof within 30 minutes. The US broker partner takes 48 hours to approve the account creation. Fund transfer from Indian bank to Overseas Bank takes around 2-3 working days. After this one can start trading. The entire process takes 48 hours - 72 hours,\" informs Sandeep Bhardwaj, CEO, Retail, IIFL Securities.  If you are still waiting on the side-lines and allocating all your money only into the domestic economy, here\\'s what Sandeep has to tell you about the opportunities in the US market. \"US equities have not only been one of the best performers over the last few years, but also allows Indian investors access to high growth new technology stocks like Amazon, Tesla, Netflix etc., which are great value creators and are not available to investors in India otherwise. It also helps in diversifying your equity portfolio. Also, considering the sustained Indian rupee depreciation against the US dollar, the returns over a longer period of time becomes really attractive.\"  As a beginner, you can start buying the top US stocks which are the global leaders in their own domain. Some of them include the FAANG stocks - Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google - and then start adding ETFs and other mid and small cap stocks to your international portfolio.

The use of cooling appliances during the day and night is proving essential for those with kids, animals orwork to doin their home offices and, according to experts, there arecheap solutions.  Auto energy switching service Migrate estimates almost half the population of the UK use electric fans to help them stay cool during the hot, summer nights.  Others have been tempted to invest in high tech cooling systems but, according to research, there is no need to spend huge amounts ofmoney.  Hot shoppers are using a £1.99 cooling product from Home Bargains to battle through the heatwave  Figures indicate that electric fans add an overall £1.7million a day to UK energy bills on average which sounds like a lot.

The experts have come up with other ways to stay cool if you are money conscious and don\\'t want to see the numbers rise on energy bills.  Opening a bedroom window, sleeping without bedcovers, sleeping in separate beds, freezing or filling a hot water bottle with ice water, and switching to a lower tog rated duvet are all good ways of staying cool on a hot summer night.  Other tips include:  Take a cold shower before bed  Keep bedroom blinds and curtains closed during the day to block out the sun  Use a spray bottle filled with cold water for a cooling mist on demand  Create a DIY air conditioner by putting a bowl of ice in front of a fan  Chill a pair of socks in the fridge and putting them on before bed  Most-Read Money Stories Today  Max Green, energy expert atConfused.comwhich conducted the research, said: \"News of a heatwave is an omen of sleepless nights to come.  \"This year the discomfort isn\\'t limited to the night; many homeworkers won\\'t be able to benefit from the perfectly adjusted air conditioning systems of their employer\\'s offices.  \"The stifling heat can confuse our judgement when it comes to deciding whether to fork out for an expensive cooling system.  \"They can be costly to buy and run, and are only useful for the few hot days the UK experiences every year.  \"The humble electric fan is still one of the most common solutions for combating the heat, and, at a cost of roughly 7p a night, it comes at a price that the majority of people will be willing to pay for comfort.\"  Get the latest money-saving and benefits news sent straight to your inbox.

A newly launched petition is calling on the UK Government to lower theState Pension ageback to 60 for both men and women to \"free up jobs for young people\" in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.  The petition, \\'Move the State Pension age back to 60 for both men and women\\',on the official Parliament website, says this should be reconsidered, \"with immediate/imminent effect\", and has already gathered more than 25,200 signatures from supporters.  State Pension ageincreased to 66 in October 2020 and is scheduled to rise to 68 between 2037 and 2039, which the UK Government says is necessary due to people living longer and spending more of their adult life in retirement.  Two ways to boost State Pension payments before and after you retire  The latest projections from the Office for National Statistics show that the number of people over State Pension age in the UK is expected to grow by a third to 16.9 million in 2042.  The petition suggests that lowering theofficial age of retirementcould be a potential solution to the looming jobs crisis after Covid-19 financial support ends later this year.  It argues this would take older people off the job market and allow younger workers hit by redundancies during the pandemic to benefit.  The petition states: \"Move the pension age back to 60 for both men and women. With immediate/imminent effect. Back to what it was for women born in the 1950s and 1960s.  \"Young people are struggling to find work and losing their jobs, due to the pandemic.  \"Why not allow older people to retire earlier, thereby freeing up jobs for young people?  \"There would be a cost, however surely a far more positive cost than paying Universal Credit?  \"Not to mention the option of restoring the balance back into young people\\'s favour and helping restore their future.\"  Latest Pensions News  Redundancies are expected to rise across the UK when the furlough scheme ends in September, meaning many more people could be competing for jobs.

Vern Buchanan (R-FL) News Release WASHINGTON - Today, House Ways and Means Committee Member Vern Buchanan and Social Security Subcommittee Chairman John B. Larson (D-CT) introduced the Know Your Social Security Act. This bill helps Americans plan for retirement by making it easier to access critical information about their Social Security earnings, contributions and future benefits.  \"Too many hardworking Americans enter retirement without enough savings,\" Buchanan said. \"Because Social Security is the primary source of income for a majority of seniors, it is imperative they have a full understanding of their benefits as they plan for retirement.\"  \"All workers deserve to have a full understanding of what they\\'re contributing to Social Security and what they can expect to receive. That\\'s why it\\'s vital we pass the Know Your Social Security Act to ensure every worker gets a Social Security Statement mailed to them,\" said Larson.  The Know Your Social Security Act requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) to resume mailing annual earnings statements to the 180 million Americans workers - between the ages of 25 and 60 years old - currently paying into Social Security, making it easier for them to keep track of their finances and plan accordingly. Despite a requirement in law to do so, the Social Security Administration abruptly suspended mailing these statements to the vast majority of working Americans in 2010.  Specifically, Social Security\\'s annual mailed statements will include the following information:  * How much a worker has earned in a given year  * A worker\\'s contributions to both Social Security and Medicare  * An estimate of the worker\\'s Social Security benefit at full retirement age  * The Social Security benefit a worker\\'s family receives when they pass away  While the SSA is supposed to be mailing these statements to nearly 180 million Americans, it is only mailing them to the 19 million people aged 60 and older not currently receiving benefits. Instead, SSA has urged the remaining 161 million individuals to access their information through the creation of an online portal. Unfortunately, only 16.7 million people have used the portal to receive their statements. As a result, more than 140 million people are not getting annual statements or don\\'t use the online portal to access vital financial planning information.  The Congressman also noted that according to the Federal Communications Commission, 19 million Americans are still living without internet access and many are concerned about sharing sensitive information, such as their Social Security number, online.  In 2018, Congressman Buchanan wrote a letter to the Social Security Inspector General, expressing his concerns about the SSA\\'s decision to suspend mailing annual statements to workers between the ages of 25 and 60.  In the 116th Congress, the Know Your Social Security Act was unanimously approved by the House Committee on Ways and Means.

       " 'Money,Coronavirus,jobs JOBS A GOOD \\'UN Unemployment falls by 200,000 as Covid recovery continues THE jobs market is continuing to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, new data shows.  The number of people in a job rose by 197,000 between April and May.  Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates?  There are now 28.5 million employees on company payrolls, but this is still 553,000 below the employment levels seen before the pandemic.  The rate of unemployment fell slightly to 4.7% in the three months to April, official jobs data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows.  The unemployment rate was 4.8% in the three months to March, after surging to a five-year high of 5.1% in February, when the number of jobless Brits at 1.74million.  Sam Beckett, ONS head of economic statistics, said: \"The number of employees on payroll grew strongly in May, up by almost 200,000, although it is still over half a million down since the pandemic struck.  \"Job vacancies continued to recover in the spring, and our early estimates suggest that by May the total had surpassed its pre-pandemic level, with strong growth in sectors such as hospitality.  \"Meanwhile the redundancy rate remains subdued, while the number of employees on furlough has continued to decline.\"  The ONS data shows that the redundancy rates fell, and is now at a similar level to before the pandemic.  Job vacancies also increased between March and May, with 758,000 positions advertised.  That\\'s just 27,000 less than January to March last year before the pandemic.  Employment minister Mims Davies said there are \"real signs of recovery in the labour market\".  The Prime Minister Boris Johnson yesterday pushed back the final stage of getting the country back on track after the pandemic.  The planned June 21 date for the last lockdown restrictions lifting has been delayed to July 19.  Rising cases of the Indian or Delta variant as it\\'s also known, have derailed the government\\'s roadmap at the last stage.  The furlough job support scheme which has supported Brits unable to work because of the pandemic will continue to September as planned.  No extension was announced as the delay was revealed..  Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"Our Plan for Jobs is working - the latest forecasts for unemployment are around half of what was previously feared and the number of employees on payroll is at its highest level since April last year.  \"We understand the value of work and the distress caused by unemployment - that is why we are continuing to support people and jobs.  \"The furlough scheme is running all the way through until September and we are creating new routes into work through apprenticeships, Kickstart placements for young people as well as targeted support for the long-term unemployed.\"  Data released last week shows the economy grew by 2.3% in April when pubs, shops and restaurants could reopen after months of being in lockdown.',\n",
       " 'current Americans Adopting New Financial Behaviors Quicker: Study; BANKING/ FINANCE Americans are making significant shifts in their work and retirement plans, in their payment and purchasing behaviors, and in their saving and investing, according to a new study released by Logica Research.  Some of the biggest changes have to do with increased use of payment apps, peer-to-peer payments and buy now, pay later options, the study found.  \"We\\'ve conducted many waves of this study over the past few years, and never before have we seen this level of acceleration when it comes to changing financial behaviors,\" Logica Research\\'s founder and chief executive, Lilah Raynor, said in a statement.  \"During the height of COVID-19, we found distinct and critical shifts in how people are working, spending, saving and investing, and this latest wave shows that many of those shifts are here to stay.\"  The message to financial brands and fintech companies, Raynor said: Adapt to meet customers where they are now.  The online study was conducted in April among 1,000 general population U.S. adults and an augment of 200 older Generation Zers, those 16 to 23. KNow Research conducted in-depth interviews to give qualitative depth to the quantitative findings.  SHIFTS FROM SPRING 2020  The survey found that 36% of respondents still in the workforce were working more hours this spring than a year ago. In addition, 9% of respondents planned to retire early, up from 3% a year ago, and 33% said they would postpone leaving the workforce, up from 26%.  More Americans are using their mobile devices for online purchases, including 70% of millennials and 57% of women in the survey. And 32% of respondents reported using P2P now, compared with 27% last spring.  Buy now, pay later and installment plans have also grown significantly over the past year:  - Gen Z: 22% vs. 15% last spring.  - Millennials: 27% vs. 12%.  - Gen X: 24% vs. 9%.  - Baby boomers: 6% vs. 5%.  Logica Research found that Americans have been able to save more over the past year, and are likely to invest more. Sixteen percent of respondents said they are putting money into the stock market, compared with 10% a year ago.  Digital assets are also capturing Americans\\' attention. Thirteen percent of respondents said they own cryptocurrency, with 47% planning to own it in the next five years.  Many Americans are turning to financial institutions for support and speaking with financial advisors more often, according to the findings.  Thirty-nine percent of survey participants said they wanted to talk to a person, 28% preferred to get advice via digital tools, and 33% wanted a combination of digital and in-person advice.  Respondents said they were looking to professionals mainly for best investing practices for their situation and advice on how to save as much money as possible to achieve their financial goals.

       " \"GameStop Doesn't Have a Blank Check After All -- Heard on the Street Apparently, even meme-stock investors have their limits.  GameStop 's fiscal first-quarter results reported Wednesday afternoon were encouraging in many respects. Revenue grew for the first time in three years, surging 25% year over year to almost $1.3 billion for the quarter ended May 1. That came thanks mostly to strong sales of the new PlayStation and Xbox consoles that -- while still sharply limited in supply due to the global chip production shortage -- drove a 37% increase in GameStop 's hardware sales to about $704 million for the quarter. The company has also been able to boost its cash reserves and reduce its debt, due to selling nearly $552 million of its shares during the quarter.  But like fellow meme-stock champion AMC Entertainment, GameStop seems to have discovered that individual investor love isn't a blank check. The company said Wednesday it intends to file papers to sell up to five million shares, after selling 3.5 million shares in April.  GameStop 's stock price slid as much as 12% after hours Wednesday following the company's results and a truncated conference call that again took no questions. AMC's stock has fallen 21% since it announced its latest stock sale last week.  But even with such a sharp after-hours drop, GameStop 's shares remain up an absurd 1,300% from the start of the year. Which means the company will need all the help it can get to justify investors' bets that it can renovate a videogame retail chain for an age when most games are sold digitally. The latest results also laid out starkly what a challenge that will be.  Game software, once GameStop 's largest business, fell 5% year over year during the quarter to about $398 million. This wasn't an industrywide problem; NPD's data shows that sales of videogame content across digital and physical channels in the U.S. rose 14% during the comparable three-month period ending in April.  Strong demand for gaming products such as the newest consoles are keeping GameStop in the game for now. But the company's long-term revival can't depend on machines that are updated once every seven or eight years. And GameStop is still in the staffing-up phase of whatever its plan is. The company formally installed Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen to the chairman slot following a successful shareholder vote on Wednesday. It also names a new chief executive and chief financial officer -- both from executive roles at Amazon.com .  Mr. Cohen told shareholders Wednesday that GameStop 's turnaround will take time. He also said the company was trying to do something in retail that no one else has done before. GameStop investors seem inclined to give the company time -- but not at any price.

       " 'Private Properties Real Estate Following $33 Million NYC Buy, Hedge-Funder Spends $39.5 Million on North Palm Beach Mansion; Igor Tulchinsky bought the roughly 19,000-square-foot spread in the Seminole Landing area less than two months after purchasing an apartment inside the country\\'s most-expensive condo tower Less than two months after closing on a $33 million apartment in Manhattan, Connecticut-based hedge-fund manager Igor Tulchinsky is buying again, this time a $39.5 million mansion in North Palm Beach, Fla.  Mr. Tulchinsky is the founder and chief executive of WorldQuant, a hedge fund and quantitative-investment management firm. In a statement, Mr. Tulchinsky\\'s agent, Ryan Serhant of Serhant, said his client is \"excited to spend a significant amount of time in Florida as WorldQuant expands its global presence to include West Palm Beach and Miami.\"  The seller of the North Palm Beach property was Jeffrey Jacobs, scion of the Cleveland real-estate family that formerly owned the Cleveland Indians. Mr. Jacobs is chairman and chief executive of Jacobs Entertainment, a developer, owner and operator of gaming and entertainment properties. He bought the land for the property roughly two decades ago and razed two smaller homes to make way for a new house.     Igor Tulchinsky. PHOTO: Michael Bucher/The Wall Street Journal  The resulting home, which first came on the market in 2019 asking $42 million, is a nearly 19,000-square-foot mansion in the upscale Seminole Landing area. The nine-bedroom property has elaborate coffered ceilings, dramatic entertaining spaces and murals. It was designed by architect Gene Pandula, a well-known Palm Beach preservationist, to harken back to the 1920s and 1930s, when architect Maurice Fatio built the kind of Mediterranean château-style villas that have become synonymous with the area.  The property also includes a safe room that can be used as an art gallery, a movie theater and a small tower that Mr. Jacobs used to house a telescope. Reached by phone, Mr. Jacobs said he wished the buyer much joy to live there.  The Seminole Landing area is known for attracting big names. Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison recently purchased a home there from hedge-fund manager Gabe Hoffman, founder of Accipiter Capital Management, for roughly $80 million, The Wall Street Journal reported.  Mr. Serhant said the wider Palm Beach luxury market continues to be strong, more than a year after Covid-19 sent buyers from the Northeast to Florida in search of better weather and more space. Mr. Serhant recently worked on a deal to sell a Palm Beach spec home on a site once owned by President Donald Trump for $122.7 million, for instance.  Elizabeth Zahra and Gary Pohrer of Douglas Elliman represented Mr. Jacobs in the deal. Chris Leavitt of Douglas Elliman also worked with Mr. Serhant on behalf of the buyer.

       " 'Money,News Money,Car insurance DRIVE DOWN COSTS Martin Lewis urges drivers to check car insurance ahead of rule change MARTIN Lewis is urging drivers to check their car insurance ahead of a rule change on renewal policies.  From January next year, insurers will be banned from charging existing customers more than new ones.  The new measures by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) are an aim to tackle the so-called loyalty premium.  The financial regulator estimates Brits could save £4.2billion over 10 years on their car and home insurance because of the shake-up.  However, Martin Lewis warned in his weekly MoneySavingExpert newsletter that it could actually lead to higher prices in the coming months.  He said: \"While the new regime starts in January, insurers will likely start to shift algorithms before - there are even signs now.  How to make sure you\\'re not being penalised for being loyal  THE best way to beat the loyalty premium is to check if you can switch and save.  These are some of the best websites to use to find a better deal on your provider.  Remember though, if you are thinking about switching before your term is up then you could face an early exit fee.  * Broadband -Broadbandchoices.co.uk  * Home insurance - MoneySuperMarket.com  * Mobiles - BillMonitor  * Mortgages - MoneySavingExpert or use a free broker such as London & Country to help you find the best deal  * Savings accounts - Savings Champion  \"This likely means the cheapest prices will disappear rapidly for those who compare and switch.  \"So I suggest everyone check as soon as possible to see if you can cut costs by grabbing cheaper switchers\\' deals.\"  Even if your policy isn\\'t up for renewal, it could be worth switching now to lock in cheaper prices, as long as the savings are big, Martin added.  Most insurers let you switch for a £50 cancellation fee and will give you a pro-rata refund, if you haven\\'t claimed on the policy.  To find the cheapest car insurance for you, check comparison sites such as Compare the Market and Go Compare as well as with providers directly.  Cashback websites including TopCashback and Quidco are also a great way to earn some extra money if you\\'re moving to a new provider.  Analysis by MoneySavingExpert has found that 23 days ahead of renewal is the best time to get a new car insurance quote, and it could halve costs.  We\\'ve rounded up nine ways to save on your car insurance, which can cut your bill by up to £2,800 a year.  It comes as homeowners are facing higher insurance premiums than at any time in the past seven years due to the Covid crisis.  While car insurers faced pressure last year to refund motorists unable to use their cars during lockdown, paying for policies they didn\\'t need.

Adam Kitchener \"used his foot as a weapon\"and told the 15-year-old boy sarcastically: \"Oops, sorry mate, I didn\\'t see you there\"Bristol Live reported.  This is the first case of its kind in Avon and Somerset which saw Kitchener resigning from the force the day beforehe was jailed for 14 weeksafter admitting assault.  He had been in uniform for 10 years and joined the force in 2016 after previously working for Thames Valley and the Metropolitan Police.  Chief constable Andy Marsh told a misconduct panel in November 2019 Kitchener, then 36, would have been sacked if he had not already resigned.

In her final weeks as police and crime commissioner, Sue Mountstevens ruled that Kitchener should lose 10 per cent of his pension.  A spokesperson for her office said this was the first pension forfeiture in Avon and Somerset.

       " \"PMN Business Investors increase Exxon holdings as activists' pressure push shares higher BOSTON - A number of prominent investment managers were so convinced that newcomer activist investor Engine No. 1 could successfully push for changes at Exxon Mobil Corp that they added to their holdings in the oil company in the first months of 2021.  Fidelity Management & Research Company, which oversees nearly $5 trillion in retirement and college savings accounts, as well as hedge funds Millennium Management and Laurion Capital Management made sizable purchases during the first quarter, regulatory filings show. Hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which was also engaging with Exxon management, also increased its holdings, the filings show.  Banking giants Bank of America Global Research and Mellon Investments also added to their holdings, the filings show.  These investors welcomed the roughly 34% gain in Exxon's share price during the first 12 weeks of 2021, after months of watching the stock slide to a low of $31.11 in late October. The company was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average in August as many speculated that a dividend cut was coming.  By early December Engine No. 1, a $250 million hedge fund, had invested some $40 million in Exxon and was publicly criticizing the oil major for lagging behind in its approach to lower-carbon energy and for poor returns on past fossil fuel investments. For the first time ever, climate change was playing a major role in the election of directors at a big U.S. company.  Since Engine No. 1 unveiled its campaign at Exxon, the stock price has climbed 47% and proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services noted that both Exxon and the hedge fund have claimed credit for the improvement.  Behind the scenes, D.E. Shaw, which owned roughly 5.6 million shares in Exxon at the end of the first quarter, also pushed the company to make changes. Amid its prodding, Exxon added two new board members, moves that underpinned confidence and helped push the share price higher.  D.E. Shaw raised its stake by 39% during the first quarter and Fidelity raised its stake by 20%, buying 14.6 million shares to own 85.2 million shares on March 31, the filings show.  Exxon did not reply to a request for comment on the so-called 13F filings. These releases are backward looking but are closely watched for possible investment trends and hints on where activists may want to push for changes next.  Other investors cut or liquidated their holdings in Exxon during the first quarter, possibly to lock in gains at time of uncertainty over the outcome of the bitter proxy fight. Shareholders will vote on directors and a handful of other matters on May 26.  Hedge fund Adage Capital slashed its holding by nearly 50%, selling 6.3 million shares to end up with 6.5 million shares at the end of the quarter. Holocene Advisors sold all 3.7 million shares that it had owned. (Reporting by Svea Herbst-Bayliss; Editing by David Gregorio)\",\n",

They\\'ve experienced disproportionate job loss and a legacy of systemic racism has resulted in a recovery that has been inequitable and has furthered oppression,\" said Senator Kayse Jama (D-East Portland) who chairs the Senate Committee on Housing and Development. \"In the last foreclosure crisis, BIPOC homeowners were more likely to lose their homes and felt greater housing insecurity, we know that is true today as well. When we keep people in their homes, we contribute to their health, their outcomes and opportunity for their children.\"  Following the Special Session in June of 2020 a workgroup convened allowing stakeholders to collaborate and create a policy that would function for lenders and mortgage holders. House Bill 2009 is a product of that collaborative work.  \"We have seen a recession before. House Bill 2009 is representative of what we learned from the last recession. So many - through no fault of their own - were not able to keep up with their mortgage during the pandemic,\" said Senator Beyer, who carried the bill on the Senate floor. \"Not only does this bill provide homeowners with stability to thrive we maintain the value of the properties in their community and avoid a hit to our economy. By taking this step, we all win.\"  Senators Beyer and Jama expressed their gratitude to Representatives Julie Fahey and Paul Holvey who brought the bill forward and worked diligently with stakeholders on this important policy.  House Bill 2009 now goes to the House of Representatives for concurrence and then goes to the Governor\\'s desk for final approval.  ###  * Original document  Disclaimer  Oregon State Legislature published this content on 17 May 2021 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

The premier divorce lawyer Robert Cohen, with the firm Cohen Clair Lens Greifer Thorpe & Rottenstreich, is representing Melinda Gates in the divorce, a firm that has also repped the likes of Michael Bloomberg and Ivana Trump, former President Donald Trump\\'s first wife, as Page Six notes. Melinda Gates also listed the estate planning attorney Loretta Ippolito and Bruce Birenboim with the firm Paul Weiss in her filings.  Ippolito advises clients on \"complex estate planning issues,\" per her profile on the Paul Weiss website, including domestic trust planning and the \"disposition of appreciated property.\"  Trust and estate planning lawyers typically help you plan how to leave your assets to beneficiaries upon your death, according to the personal finance website The Balance.  Experts told the outlet that it\\'s \"most unusual for trust and estate lawyers\\' names to be listed on a divorce filing,\" and the move could mean that Melinda Gates may want to change the amount of money that their kids inherit.

Bill Gates has said that their children will inherit $10 million each, and the rest of the couple\\'s sizable $130 billion fortune will go to charity.  Representatives for Melinda and Bill Gates did not immediately respond to Insider\\'s request for comment.

       " 'Blog Tamayo\\'s \\'Naturaleza muerta\\' to Highlight Christie\\'s Latin American Art Sale Christie\\'s Latin American art sale in New York, a live event on May 19, will feature a range of modern and contemporary pieces as well as 17th- and 18th-century Spanish colonial paintings.  The auction will be headlined by Naturaleza muerta by Mexican painter Rufino Tamayo (1899-1991), which has a presale estimate between US$1.8 million and US$2.5 million.  Created in 1935, the painting embodies Tamayo\\'s signature style, which combines modern European painting techniques with Mexican folk themes. At the center of the painting are two bottles, one with a label showing just the word \"Mexico,\" while the other reads \"Tamayo.\"  Other vessels and fruits on the table mostly evoke the feel of European Cubism except for three pink watermelon slices, a motif directly related to Tamayo\\'s childhood spent in Oaxaca and Mexico City, Christie\\'s said.  Naturaleza muerta was originally in the collection of Edward Chodorov, a prolific Broadway playwright and movie producer. Later, the painting was acquired by Fanny Brice, a comedian and actress best known as the creator and star of the radio comedy series \"The Baby Snooks Show.\" From there, the painting found a home with Mary-Anne Martin Fine Art, a New York art gallery focusing on Mexican and Latin American art, and from which the current owner-whose identity was not disclosed-acquired the painting, according to the auction house.  \"This sale covers the wide breadth of Latin American art, from Spanish colonial paintings to contemporary works,\" Virgilio Garza, head of Latin American art at Christie\\'s, said in a statement. \"The sale features stellar works by modern masters of the category, including significant works by Fernando Botero, Tamayo and more.\"  Another highlight of the sale is Colombian artist and sculptor Botero\\'s The Bather, 1975, appearing at auction for the first time with an estimate between US$1.8 million and US$2.5 million.  The triptych shows the subject, an imposing, rotund woman, from the front, back and side. In each panel, she dwarfs her male companions either swimming in the pistachio-green pool or resting on a pink towel.  Some of Botero\\'s works on paper are also offered for sale, including Dancers, with a low estimate of US$700,000, and Still Life with Soup Tureen and Watermelon, estimated to sell for more than US$150,000.  The 100-lot auction, with an estimated total of more than US$10 million, also includes 22 examples of Spanish colonial works, which have seen a growing demand from American and European collectors as well as institutions.  This group is led by Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe, circa 1750, with a presale estimate between US$40,000 and US$60,000.  The items can be viewed, by appointment only, from now until May 19 at Christie\\'s Rockefeller Center galleries in New York.

       " 'Money Frugal savers effectively paying banks to hold their cash Consumer savings have continued to grow strongly during the pandemic as more people get their personal finances in order, but billions of dollars of those extra savings are sitting in bank accounts earning next to nothing in interest.  The amount of interest paid on bank deposits is nowhere near the rate at which prices are rising.  The Consumer Price Index, which measures inflation, rose 1.1 per cent in the year ended March 31, Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) figures show. That means savers are effectively paying the bank to hold their money, in real terms.  Figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), analysed by RateCity, show an additional $124 billion was on deposit in March this year, compared to March 2020, as the economic and health implications of COVID-19 took hold. That is an increase of more than 12 per cent and includes savings, term deposits and transaction accounts, as well mortgage offset accounts.  RateCity research director Sally Tindall says families have prioritised savings during COVID-19.  \"Since the pandemic hit, many have put their personal finances first, getting themselves into a stronger position so they can tackle future challenges,\" she says.  Tindall says lockdowns, lower interest rates and COVID-19 induced initiatives have helped many families to build a savings buffer.  At the same time, interest rates paid on savings have plummeted.  \"Banks are full to the brim with cash from households. As a result, they simply aren\\'t willing to pay anything more than peanuts [in interest],\" Tindall says.  The official cash rate is 0.1 per cent and the big banks have slashed interest rates on saving accounts.  Rabobank Australia\\'s High Interest Savings Account pays interest of 1.5 per cent - the highest standard saver rate available - but only for the first four months after an account is opened. Later, the rate reverts to 0.25 per cent.  There are some better deals around if you meet specific criteria. For example, Westpac\\'s Life Account is paying up to 3 per cent interest to those aged between 18 and 29, up to the first $30,000. Bank of Queensland\\'s Fast Track Starter Account also pays up to 3 per cent for those savers aged between 14 to 24, up to the first $10,000. These are conditional saver accounts, where the higher rate of interest is paid as long as conditions are met.  RateCity\\'s Tindall says for those with mortgages, an offset account can be a good place to park some savings. Money held in an offset account reduces the amount of mortgage owed, reducing interest payable on the total loan balance.  The effective rate of interest on money in the offset account is the mortgage interest rate. The average rate on mortgages with offset accounts listed on RateCity\\'s database is 3.43 per cent.  The money deposited in an offset account is \"on call\" and can be accessed at any time.',\n",

Ferguson notes that bipartisan proposals introduced last Congresswouldhelp Americans save for retirement at all stages of their career, particularly by having employers match employee's student loan repayments with contributions to their retirement plans, writing:  'One of the most interesting proposals contained in both pieces of legislation would allow employers to essentially match an employee's student loan repayments with contributions to the employee's retirement plan. [?] This holds tremendous promise for addressing two major financial challenges at once - the sometimes-crushing student debt burdening many workers in their 20s and 30s and the need to start saving for retirement as early as possible.'  KEY TAKEAWAYS:  The pandemic has interrupted plans for many Americans to save for retirement as they face financial and health challenges.  * According to a recent Pew Research study, half of U.S. adults reported that the economic impact of the pandemic will make it harder for them to achieve their long-term financial goals.  * A quarter of U.S. adults ages 50 or over expect that they will have to delay retirement due to the pandemic.  * Nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults say they worry every day or almost every day about their ability to save for retirement, according to the same study.  Congress should quickly address these challenges by passing the bipartisan Securing a Strong Retirement Act.  * The bill reflects the savings' needs that workers face today, by allowing workers to pay down a student loan instead of contributing to a 401(k) plan and still receive an employer match in their employees' retirement plan.  Support for the bipartisan bill continues to grow.  * The bill received the endorsement of AARP, with the advocacy group saying the bill will 'make a number of improvements' to our nation's retirement systems.'

Compared with bare ground, FM and PM both increased yield of wheat (20-26%) and maize (37-52%), and WUE of wheat (16-20%) and maize (38-48%), with statistically undistinguishable differences between PM and FM. The increases in crop yield and WUE were stronger at elevation > 1000 m, with annual precipitation <400 mm, and on loess soil, especially for maize.\"  According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"We concluded that partial-film mulch could replace full-film mulch to return similar yield and WUE improvement, with reduced cost and environmental pollution.\"  This research has been peer-reviewed.

       " '$68M RAISED IN PMG FLAGSHIP PACIFIC PROPERTY FUND Unlisted commercial property funds manager PMG Property Funds Management has fully subscribed an offer to raise $68 million in its flagship fund, Pacific Property Fund.  PMG Chief Executive Officer Scott McKenzie said the offer - in one of New Zealand\\'s largest directly-held and unlisted commercial property funds - is the largest opportunity the company has brought to market to date.  \"Given the current low interest rate environment, the attractive return that Pacific Property Fund is offering investors, and the Fund\\'s highly diversified nature, we knew there was going to be considerable interest from the public to invest,\" Scott McKenzie said.  \"We believe the speed at which the offer was taken up is a direct reflection of the track record PMG and our funds have demonstrated over time, and investors seeking out reliable alternatives to term deposits.  \"On top of that, the recent restrictions and compliance pressures placed on the residential property investment market highlights the strength, historical resilience and ease of investing in an unlisted commercial property fund like Pacific Property Fund.\"  The Pacific Property Fund (the Fund) offers retail investors a strong comparable forecast gross cash dividend of 7.35 cents per share per annum paid quarterly which, at the current share issue price of $1.22 per share, represents a gross cash return of 6.02 per cent per annum (paid quarterly).  From March 2021 to June 2021, the Fund expects to acquire six properties, with four of these properties to be acquired using the funds raised from the offer. Together, the six properties are valued at $128 million.  The properties to be acquired include two high-quality industrial properties (one in Christchurch and Wellington), two A-grade and recently built office properties (Anderson Lloyd House and Nexia House) in Christchurch\\'s CBD, and two industrial properties in Auckland and Hamilton.  On settlement of all six properties, the Fund\\'s portfolio will consist of 20 quality commercial properties with 62 tenants located across the country, achieving a total estimated portfolio value of $393 million.  PMG\\'s chairman, Denis McMahon, said that he is pleased to see the strong response to Pacific Property Fund\\'s latest offer.  \"When we established the Fund in 2014, the aim was to grow a robust and diverse fund which would withstand major economic downturns. I believe that the performance of the Fund through the pandemic in 2020 showed that we have succeeded in doing just that,\" McMahon said.  Since 1 April 2016, the Fund has delivered a higher than 10 per cent total annualised return to investors.  Pacific Property Fund has also recently been rated the equivalent of a four out of five-star rating regarding its high-quality investment offering by independent investment research house, Research IP.  PMG plans to bring additional investment offerings to market this year in its five unlisted commercial property funds.

       " \"Money,Sainsbury's ANOTHER ROUND Sainsbury's is offering 25% off 6 bottles of prosecco, champagne and wine for bank holiday weekend SAINSBURY'S has launched a deal today where you can get 25% off the price of booze.  The discount applies if you buy six or more bottles of wine, champagne or prosecco and you can claim the money-off orders all week.  The deal on wine, champagne and prosecco began today and it is running until Sunday (May 2).  The store is offering the deal just in time the bank holiday weekend that falls at the beginning of May.  In the deal, a 750ml bottle of posh Moet costs £17.25 with the discount - saving you £5.75 on the full price of £23.  Of course, you'll need to buy six bottles for the deal to kick in. Normally, six bottles would set you back £138 but in the offer the booze costs £103.50.  Alternatively, if you're more of a prosecco fan you can get 750ml bottles of Freixenet Prosecco for £9 each, saving you £3 per bottle.  Normally a box of six would cost £72 but the offer brings the price down to £54.  And if you're more of a fan of wine, a 750ml bottle of Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc was £10, but now it's down to just £7.50 when you buy a crate of six.  The 25% discount excludes any bottles that are under £5 in England or £7 in Wales.  And it also doesn't apply for bottles that are 200ml and under, as well as all Sainsbury's House wine, all fortified wine, boxed wine and gift sets.  It's worth bearing in mind that the deal is only worth it if you were already planning on buy six bottles of plonk, other wise you're spending more money than you need to.  On Sainsburys' website you can browse the wine selection where the qualifying products have a little red offer indicator displayed, which will help you determine what you can get at the bargain prices.  The deal is available online and in stores although online shoppers will need to factor in the delivery costs, which start at £1.  Or you can use the store's click and collect service thats free over £40 or £4 for anything cheaper, and the option of simply heading to your nearest supermarket is available as well.  Sainsburys has over 600 supermarkets in the UK and you can cash in on the deal at participating stores using the helpful locator tool to find out where your closest one is.  We've revealed six secrets to bagging 'yellow sticker' food from supermarkets including Sainsburys, and Tesco, Asda and Aldi too.  We also have the low down on Sainsburys' opening hours and everything you need to know about ordering online with the supermarket.

       " \"Encore News & Commentary What happens when worker benefits are cut? Some suggest that workers offset benefit loss with more saving elsewhere; Evidence from state and local workers suggests that doesn't always happen Evidence from state and local workers suggests that doesn't always happen  The economist's simple life cycle model predicts that workers will respond to a $1 decrease in their defined benefit savings by increasing their supplemental savings by $1. Whether this prediction holds in practice may turn out to be very important for state and local workers.  Read: Saving for retirement? Here are 4 key lessons  Although the common story is that these workers spend a full career in government and retire with substantial defined benefit pensions, that often is not the case - all plans are not equally generous, many plans may lack the funding to pay full benefits, and one in four public sector workers is not covered by Social Security.  Read: What's the best place for you to retire? Pick what matters most - you may be surprised  In other words, a lot of reasons exist for state and local workers to augment their pensions with outside saving, and all state workers and most local workers have access to supplemental defined-contribution plans - namely 457s, 401(k)s, 401(a)s, and 403(b)s.  To see whether public workers take advantage of these options, my colleagues estimated the relationship between participation in a supplemental defined-contribution plan, on the one hand, and low wealth accumulation in a defined-benefit plan, low plan funded levels, or lack of Social Security coverage, on the other. To do this analysis, they merged individual-level data in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) with plan-level data from the Public Plans Database (PPD).  Read: The 5 most affordable Caribbean islands to retire to - and 2 to avoid  The key results suggest that workers do respond to low contributions to their primary defined-benefit plan - the solid red bars in figure 1 below - but the magnitudes are tiny. For example, a one-percentage-point increase in the employer contribution rate is only associated with a 0.19-percentage-point decrease in the participation rate, relative to a baseline of 21%. And the striped bars in Figure 1 show that workers do not respond at all to having a very poorly funded pension plan or not having Social Security coverage.  The bottom line is that people do not always respond as theory would suggest. State and local workers may simply not be aware of how much saving is taking place through their defined benefit pension; they may not appreciate the extent to which their plan is adequately funded; and they may not understand the implications of not being covered by Social Security.  Read: This no-nonsense strategy can get you the retirement you want  Whatever the reason for the lack of response, states and localities cannot count on their workers making up for reduced pension income through supplemental savings.\",\n",
       " 'SCAM ALERT: LOAN REPAYMENT COMPANIES SCAMMING STUDENTS, CHARGING THEM FOR SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR FREE FRANKFORT, Ky., April 16 -- Gov. Andy Beshear issued the following news release:  Today, Gov. Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority (KHEAA) warned that if Kentucky students owe money on federal student loans, they should watch out for scamming loan repayment companies.  The companies offering to help students lower their payments may be charging large fees for services available for free.  \"My administration will always put education first, and part of that means protecting Kentucky students, after they\\'ve graduated, from predatory companies trying to take advantage of them as they pay back the loans that helped them pursue their education goals,\" Gov. Beshear said.  Some third-party companies claim to offer document preparation services and act as though they can help students qualify for a loan forgiveness program, but they may want upfront fees and personal and financial information. The Federal Trade Commission says it is illegal for companies to charge upfront fees before providing debt relief services.  The Governor and KHEAA warn borrowers to be skeptical about companies that:  Ask for payment up front and for monthly fees to monitor an account; Promise immediate loan forgiveness; or Ask for a student\\'s FSA ID password and a power of attorney. \"To avoid falling victim to a scam, start with the servicer the Department of Education has assigned your loan to,\" said Gene Hutchins, executive director of the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority. \"Your servicer can tell you what your options are and can help you with the forms you need. And unlike these scam companies, your servicer will never charge you a fee for their assistance.\"  If a student doesn\\'t know what his or her servicer is, that information can be found at https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans.  If students believe they have been contacted by a scammer, they should report it to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau here and the Kentucky Attorney General\\'s Office here.  This is KHEAA\\'s Money Tip of the Month.  KHEAA is the state agency that administers Kentucky\\'s grant and scholarship programs, including the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship (KEES).

       " 'Biden Administration continues postponement of student loan debt payments for graduates University of Texas - Austin ; Austin, TX - news  By  Current students and alumni will not have interest accumulating on their public student loans and alumni can defer payment until at least Sept. 30 due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of Education announced on March 30.  Kyle Morgenstein, an aerospace engineering graduate student who completed his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he has about $95,000 in student loan debt. He said not having to pay payments with interest accumulating has been helpful since he started his graduate studies during the pandemic.  \"Not having to pay that for this period means I can put some money away (or) I can spend on other things,\" Morgenstein said. \"I just moved to Austin, so there\\'s moving expenses, so it\\'s definitely freed up a lot of other things that I wouldn\\'t have been able to do otherwise.\"  When students go into graduate school right after completing undergraduate studies, they can continue to defer payments on their public loans until 6 or 9 months after graduating from their studies, depending on the type of loan, according to the federal student aid website.  Morgenstein said he planned to defer his payments until after he completed his graduate degree, but interest would have continued to accumulate without the COVID-19 relief. He said this would have caused him to pay $30,000 to $40,000 more in interest.  Angel Fletcher, radio-television-film freshman, said she plans to graduate in three years so she does not have to pay for a fourth year of college.  \"I\\'d love to not rush my schooling and pace myself and make better grades,\" Fletcher said. \"Instead of having $80,000 in debt, maybe I\\'ll have $60,000 if I graduate in three years instead of four (years).\"  Law professor Mechele Dickerson, who researches consumer protection and civil procedure, said there would be an economic benefit to canceling some student loan debt. She said if graduates constantly work towards paying off the student loans, they are delaying big life events such as buying a house or having children, which in the long run can have large-scale negative consequences for the economy.  According to The Hill, the Biden Administration is considering cancelling some public student debt through Congress.  Dickerson said it is hard to determine how much student loan debt forgiveness would be helpful to both the economy and the borrowers because of the disproportionate effect student loan debt has on low income students, Black students and Latinx students.  \"The reality is when you look at the average amount of student loan debt, it\\'s about 25,000,\" Dickerson said. \"Most students don\\'t owe 60, 70 (or) $80,000 in student loan debt.\"  Editor\\'s Note: This article first appeared in the April 9 issue of The Daily Texan.

The NHSC Loan Repayment Program helps medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health clinicians pay off their student loan debt in exchange for working in a Health Professional Shortage Area - or a defined geographic area with too few providers.  \"This historic program funding for NHSC means that we will provide a record number of loan repayment awards for eligible clinicians,\" says Dr. Luis Padilla, associate administrator of HRSA\\'s Bureau of Health Workforce and director of NHSC. \"Every community has felt COVID-19\\'s effects and this will allow NHSC applicants to serve in communities where they may not have been competitive to receive an award before due to sites with lower HPSA scores.\"  The NHSC is currently taking applications for three NHSC Loan Repayment Programs until May 6, 2021. Eligible disciplines include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, behavioral/mental health clinicians, and more. Qualified clinicians may receive up to $100,000 in educational loan repayment, depending on the award.  Providers may apply for one of three NHSC loan repayment programs:  1) NHSC Loan Repayment Program  This two-year commitment program supports clinicians with up to $50,000 to pay off their student loan debt in exchange for service at an NHSC-approved site.  2) NHSC Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Program  This three-year commitment supports the recruitment and retention of health professionals with up to $75,000. Providers must be working to combat the nation\\'s opioid crisis, expand access to evidence-based, medication-assisted treatment, and prevent overdose deaths in underserved areas. Applicants must work at an NHSC-approved SUD treatment facility located in a HPSA.  3) NHSC Rural Community Loan Repayment Program  This three-year commitment addresses the pressing need for qualified SUD providers in rural communities and awards up to $100,000 in loan repayment funds. Applicants must work at a NHSC-approved SUD treatment facility located in a rural HPSA.

The amazing four-bed home, which stands next door to a historic castle, has four bathrooms and a south-facing garden - but there\\'s another hidden feature adding to the whopping price tag.  The property comes with its own cave - and the extra space has been transformed into a unique wine cellar.

There\\'s another bedroom and bathroom on the top floor, while on the lower floor, there\\'s an office and cinema room, both with vaulted ceilings.

       " 'News Door handles removed from Courtice retirement home highlights need for better whistleblower protections: union The ongoing investigation into a Courtice retirement home - after an unknown number of residents had their door handles removed - is illustrating the need for better whistleblower protection for workers, according to the union.  \"One of our members did, in fact, whistleblow. We have since made statements about needing meaningful whistleblower protection,\" said Stella Yeadon, a Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) communications spokesperson. \"The fact that there\\'s very little regulatory oversight at retirement homes is a problem.\"  Yeadon said the local union representatives are focused on protecting the identity of the White Cliffe Terrace Retirement Residence whistleblower. Even the Ontario CUPE office doesn\\'t know which Courtice worker raised concerns about the unknown number of residents being allegedly trapped in their rooms.  \"Even though they\\'ve done a good thing - no one denies whistle-blowing is a good thing - there\\'s no safety in whistle-blowing,\" said Yeadon.  Retirement home workers need their jobs, and many work in a culture that relies heavily on disciplinary measures, Yeadon added. During times of short-staffing, staff may fear being disciplined for not completing tasks on time, and when mistakes occur, discipline is often imposed on front-line staff without considering all the mitigating factors involved, a CUPE statement added.  Whistleblowers are protected under the Long Term Care Homes Act - it protects them from reprisal for contacting Ministry of Long Term care inspectors or to a coroner during an inquest.  Clarington Councillor Corinna Traill, who early in her law career worked briefly in labour law, said she has concerns about the fact the statute says that retaliation and reprisal are offences but does not prescribe any penalties for these offences. She said the existing health-care worker legislation should be amended to include whistleblower protections and should also add stringent penalties for violations.  \"Personal support workers (PSWs) are particularly vulnerable because many of these jobs are low paying. When I was a lawyer for a union which represented PSWs at several long-term care facilities, many of the staff worked several jobs, sometimes even working at more than one long-term care facility to make ends meet. Often, these employees were single parents and visible minorities,\" Coun. Traill said via email.  The lesson to be taken from the investigation at White Cliffe Terrace is the provincial legislators should make the necessary changes to existing legislation to protect health-care workers, residents in long-term care, and their families, Coun. Traill added.  CUPE plans to advocate more for better whistleblower protections for front-line workers in retirement homes in light of the incident at White Cliffe Terrace, Yeadon explained.

       " \"Pension Credit eligibility: Who can claim pension credits? PENSION CREDIT gives extra money to help with living costs for people who are State Pension age and over. But who can claim pension credits?  Some people claiming the State Pension could be entitled to extra help if they're a carer, severely disabled or responsible for a child or young person, which is called pension credits. Pension credit is separate from your State Pension, so the money you get will be on top of any existing income. Pension Credits are paid in two different ways, either the Savings Credit or the Guaranteed Credit. Pension credit is paid on a weekly basis.  Related articles  Who can claim Pension Credits?To claim pension guaranteed credit you must:  You can still be working full time or part time, as long as your income isn't too high, and unlike the State Pension, you don't need a national insurance record.  READ MORE: Martin Lewis: TV Licence payment will increase - but some won't pay  READ MORE  Before applying for guaranteed credit, it's a good idea to gather everything you can about your weekly income before applying.  Common forms of income are:  You'll also need to consider what savings and investments you have, which could include property owned; shares and other investments and money held in bank or savings accounts.  Any savings or investments over £10,000 will affect the amount of Pension Credit you're entitled to.  You will be treated as having £1 per week of income for every £500 above £10,000.  If your weekly income is less than £173.75, then the guaranteed pension credit will top you up to that amount.  If you're claiming as a couple, you'll need the exact same information about your partner's income too.

The amount you can get depends on whether or not you meet the 'savings credit threshold'.  This means you must have a weekly income of at least £150.47 per week if you're single.  If you're claiming as a couple, then the income threshold is slightly higher, standing at £239.17 a week.  The income rules, however, are slightly different to the savings credit.  Don't count any income you get from:  The most you can get from Savings Credit is £13.97 a week if you're single, or £15.62 a week if you're claiming as a couple.

       " \"Money 'Omega won't replace my defective £4,000 watch, even though it loses time' Has a company treated you unfairly? Our consumer champion, Sally Hamilton, is here to help  Katie Morley is on maternity leave.? Award-winning personal finance journalist Sally Hamilton will be fighting readers' corners until her return.  Has a company treated you unfairly? Our consumer champion, Sally Hamilton, is here to help. For how to contact her click here.  ?  Dear Sally,  My wife bought me a new Omega Seamaster watch as a wedding present, but unfortunately it has been a source of great frustration. I received it in December 2016, but in June 2017 it developed a faulty part, which was causing it to gain time every day. It was returned to Omega UK to have the part replaced.  The watch worked perfectly until April 2019, when it failed again and so was duly returned and repaired. The watch was again working perfectly until December 2020, when it developed a third fault. This time, Omega said the lubrication had escaped and fouled the mechanism, causing the watch to lose time.  I'm reluctant to accept that a £4,000 watch has to be repaired a third time in four years. Omega will only agree to repair the watch and offer an additional warranty. I believe the watch is essentially defective and should be replaced.  Despite escalating the case with the company, it will not change its stance. I do not want to be in this position of having the watch repaired every few months - and each time it goes away, I lose the watch for a month.  - HB, by email  Dear HB,  Everyone needs a watch to be reliable, whether it's a modest make or luxury brand. But when you pay a small fortune for a timepiece, as your wife did, you don't expect it to be losing time and need repairing so frequently.  When I contacted Omega, it responded quickly, reviewed your case and said that it was happy to offer you a replacement watch after all.  You tell me you are very grateful.  Hello from me  If you have turned to this column and wondered what has happened to Katie Morley, I can tell you that she is investigating parenthood for the next few months.  Never fear, I have promised her faithfully that I will look after her loyal readers while she is away. I am what some might call a veteran personal finance journalist, having covered money matters for national newspapers for more than 25 years.  During my award-winning career, I have solved many complaints on behalf of readers and intend to keep up Katie's fantastic work at holding companies to account.

In a viral TikTokvideo, the soon-to-be mum-of-four showed off her bundle of Pampers nappies, baby wipes and vitamins.  After directing viewers to her blog, Holly said: \"Some people wonder why baby brands give out so many freebies and it\\'s because it\\'s great marketing.  \"For example, if you get a free pack of new baby nappies and you really like them and you go on to purchase them for the next time years? ka-ching for the brand!\"  In a separate video, Holly explained how mums can get a free MAM bottle starter pack worth £9.99.

       " 'COVID-19 vaccinations in Ontario long-term care homes saved hundreds of lives: report Vaccinations in Ontario long-term care homes have prevented hundreds of COVID-19 deaths and thousands of infections, scientists advising the province said in a report released Monday.  The Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table said that eight weeks after vaccinations began in December, infections were reduced by 89 per cent among long-term care residents and by 79 per cent among workers.  Deaths from COVID-19 among long-term care residents were reduced by 96 per cent over the same period.\\xa0  \"These data highlight the importance of accelerating vaccine rollout to priority populations who are at disproportionately high risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization and death,\" the report said.\\xa0  Ontario\\'s vaccine rollout began in December with long-term care workers after Health Canada approved the Pfizer-BioNTech shot for use in the country. Nursing home residents started to get vaccinated towards the end of that month.\\xa0  Those two groups were prioritized for vaccines given the high rates of deaths and infections in the long-term care sector since the pandemic began.\\xa0  The report noted that long-term care residents represent less than one per cent of Ontario\\'s population but have made up more than half of the COVID-19 deaths in the province.\\xa0  The researchers behind the report estimated that vaccinations prevented more than 2,600 infections, 250 hospitalizations and 615 deaths, most of those among residents, between Dec. 14, 2020 and Feb. 23.\\xa0  The report noted that 92 per cent of long-term care residents had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by Feb. 23, with that number rising to 95 per cent by March 5.  Monday\\'s report also said strong provincewide public health measures implemented in December and January had worked along with vaccinations to prevent infections.  \"This emphasizes that public health measures will need to be maintained alongside vaccination, until vaccine-based immunity has been afforded to the entire population,\" the report said.\\xa0  Completing maximum uptake of vaccinations in the homes \"will maximize the safety and well-being of Ontario\\'s LTC residents and staff,\" the report said.  Vaccine uptake among long-term care staff was at 68 per cent as of March 5 -- lower than the reported vaccination intention rate of 80 per cent among unionized workers, the report noted.\\xa0  Closing the vaccination gap among workers is \"essential,\" the report said, and may require communication as well as financial supports like paid time off, transportation to a vaccination site and sick leave in case people miss work due to side-effects.\\xa0  Researchers also noted that \"a substantial number\" of Ontario long-term care residents may have already achieved some immunity to COVID-19 due to previous infection.\\xa0  That might have increased apparent vaccine effectiveness when compared with the unvaccinated control population living in the community, they said.\\xa0  This report by The Canadian Press was first published March 8, 2021.',\n",
       " 'U.S. Senator Tina Smith Says Senate-Passed Pension Relief Package Stops Drastic Cuts Looming for 22,000 Minnesota Retirees; Senator Says Pension Fix Will Bolster Retirement Security for More Than 1 Million Americans; Sen. Tina Smith (D-MN) News Release WASHINGTON, D.C. [3/6/21]--U.S. Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package passed by the Senate today includes a key measure to bolster the solvency of the multiemployer pension system and prevent drastic cuts to pensions earned by more than 22,000 Minnesotans. The measure passed today stems from Sen. Smith\\'s years-long push to help the more than 1 million workers and retirees nationwide--including more than 22,000 Minnesotans--who had been facing deep cuts to their hard-earned pensions.  Sen. Smith said without the action from Congress, the more than 22,000 Minnesotans who paid into Central States Pension Fund, as well as a total of more than 1 million retirees nationwide who are part of various multi-employer pension funds, would have seen their pensions drastically cut, in some cases by up to 90%. The relief plan, passed Saturday, will help ensure that pension benefits for workers and their families will be fully protected and workers can enjoy the retirements they earned.  \"The economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic hit already-struggling pension plans hard and threatened to upend retirement security for 22,000 hard-working Minnesotans who are part of the Central States Pension Fund. These workers put in long hours for many years, and were promised that when they retired, the pension funds that they paid into during their working years would be there for them,\" said Sen. Smith, a member of the Senate Labor and Pensions Committee. \"The COVID-19 relief package which passed today will not only help ensure that they have the secure retirement they\\'ve earned, but also that we shore up pension systems across the country that millions of working Americans rely upon.\"  Senator Smith said the relief package would provide about $80 billion in direct assistance to more than 100 financially struggling pension plans through the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp (PBGC), which provides a safety net for the nation\\'s pension plans.  In 2018, Sen. Smith was one of just eight Senators named to a bipartisan committee on pension solvency, where she worked with Minnesota retirees to fix the struggling Central States fund and to improve the solvency of multiemployer pension funds across the country. She was also a key supporter of the Butch Lewis Act, a measure aimed at protecting the pensions of retirees in Minnesota and across the country. The pension fix passed Saturday was based on that legislation. After Senate passage Saturday, the rescue plan will be sent to the House, before it goes to President Biden, who is expected to sign it into law.

Toni Mayor, President of the Valencian Hotel Association (HOSBEC) said that the soaring demand was following pent up demand from UK holidaymakers who have missed out on previous holidays due to the pandemic.  While he didn\\'t have exact figures, he told local media that the reservations were being made on a \"massive scale\" to areas in Valencia which includes Benidorm.  This is despite the UK government yet to give an official date for when foreign holidays can resume.  The announcement, due to be on April 12, is expected to be for the summer with May 17 the earliest possible date, although is more likely to be June 21.

The country\\'s foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez previously said: \"Vaccine passports will make it easier to return to mobility - but it needs to be coordinated.  \"What we have in mind is that obviously people with vaccine certificates are in the lower-risk, versus other people who may be on the higher risk and would have to go through the ordinary procedures of PCR tests and the rest.  \"But of course there could be some sort of fast-track for people who have gotten their vaccine and can prove it with vaccine certification, that would have it easier, to move around?because they would be in the lower-risk category.\"  The UK is also leading with the vaccine - more than 17m people have received their first jab, working out to one in three adults, or nearly 27 per cent of the population.  Spain is lagging behind, however - just 4.4. per cent of the overall population has been vaccinated, although the country is one of the highest for giving out both doses of the vaccine.  Benidorm is also relaunching their beach \"squares\" which tourists have to reserve, despite them causing long queues last summer.  The scheme was originally launched to allow social distancing at the popular beaches, and is restarting from March 1.  Last year, the new mandatory reservations sold out so quickly that tourists were forced to queue for more than two hours to get onto the beach in 30C heat.',\n",

(TURN) issued an open letter to the board and shareholders of Enzo Biochem. (ENZ). The letter read, in part, \" 180 is a publicly traded closed-end fund focused on investing in micro capitalization public companies with a constructive, collaborative and collegial activist approach. We currently own 1,147,969 shares, or 2.4%, of Enzo Biochem, and we believe the company is extremely undervalued. I recently sent an email to the ENZ\\'s Board of Directors to set up a time to speak about the results of ENZ\\'s recent proxy vote and overall corporate governance at the company. My email and request have unfortunately thus far gone unanswered. I can only assume that the Board is hard at work trying to create value for its shareholders rather than speaking to shareholders.   To that point, we are deeply concerned that the current management team is completely incapable of generating a return for its shareholders judging from performance of ENZ\\'s stock during its tenure... The Board\\'s apparent belief that $7.4 million in cash, stock options and other forms of compensation properly reflects Mr. Rabbini\\'s performance as CEO raises what we believe are troubling questions about ENZ\\'s overall corporate governance...At the referenced meeting of shareholders, votes were cast en masse to denounce the egregious and deplorable treatment of shareholders for the benefit of management by not electing Mr. Rabbini to another term as a director. Mr. Rabbani has submitted his resignation, and as of yet, the Board has still not accepted it. We are deeply concerned that the Board may choose to ignore not only the opinion of the two most respected corporate governance organizations in the country, but also the will of the majority of ENZ\\'s shareholders. This isn\\'t a game. ENZ\\'s shareholders voted in a clear and unambiguous manner and it is your responsibility as Board members to act immediately on their behalf...The track record at Enzo is abysmal, and we believe it is about time that the Board takes action and shows accountability to its shareholders. In our view this is a settled issue at this point. We expect you to immediately accept the resignation of Mr. Rabbani. In addition, you should ensure the company has a proper Board that works for the shareholders, find the appropriate new leadership for the business, and determine the best path forward, including all potential strategic alternatives. This falls in your lap. Your shareholders, including 180, are watching. The watchdog governance organizations are watching. Despite your decision to not respond to our efforts to talk about the business with you, we will not remain silent and on the sidelines. We will be activists and take what steps we feel are appropriate to hold accountable those that have caused meaningful destruction of shareholder value and seek to reinstate proper corporate governance at ENZ. \"',\n",
       " \"Money Universal Credit: How you can claim up to £151 a week extra from PIP benefits Thousands of people in the UK may be entitled to extra help with their finances if they have a long-term health condition -on top of monthly Universal Credit payments  Universal Credit claimants with debilitating health conditions are being reminded they may be eligible for a £151 boost, as ministers remain in dispute over the future of the £20 a week uplift.  Personal Independence Payments PIP are available to vulnerable people with long-term illnesses or a disability.  The extra support was introduced in 2013 and will eventually replace the Disability Living Allowance DLA.  It means you can get financial support if you struggle with moving around or everyday activities, such as getting dressed.  Applicants can get between £23.60 and £151.40 a week from the day they turn 16 until retirement age.  Unlike Universal Credit, PIP is not means-tested, meaning you qualify regardless of any income or tax contributions.  However, you must have a health condition or disability that affects your day-to-day life and should be expected to continue for at least nine months.  You need to have lived in England, Scotland or Wales for at least two of the previous three years to be eligible.  How much support is available  Universal Credit was introduced in 2013 to bring several benefits such as unemployment and housing support into one single payment.  The standard Universal Credit allowance starts at £342.72 but you could also be entitled to up to £151 extra through PIP if you have an illness, disability or mental health condition.  PIP is made up of two parts: daily living and mobility.  To begin with, your condition will be assessed by the Department for Work and Pensions DWP.  They will assess how you cope with tasks such as preparing and eating food, getting dressed and making financial decisions.  The weekly rate could be £59.70 or £89.15 depending how much support you need.  Those with a terminal illness will qualify for the higher rate.  The weekly mobility payment is either £23.60 or £62.25, depending on how hard it is for you to get around.  It is based on criteria such as how well you follow directions and if you can stand and walk unaided.  PIP is monthly, with payments assessed once a year.  Get the latest money advice, news and help straight to your inbox -sign up at mirror.co.uk/email  How to apply for PIP support  You can apply for PIP through the DWP's PIP claims line between 8am and 5pm Monday to Friday.  The number for the DWP PIP claims line is 0800 917 2222 or you can request a postal form by writing to Personal Independence Payment New Claims, Post Handling Site B, Wolverhampton, WV99 1AH.

       " 'NJ clears big utility to install smart meters, sends the bill to customers All New Jersey electric utilities have proposed changing their customers meters to digitally networked ones since the state moratorium on them ended last year. These so-called smart meters enable utilities to cut costs and improve some services.  Smart utility meters are a routine extension of improved technology and bound to happen. Theyre already installed on 90 million American homes.  But, as we said when Atlantic City Electric described its proposal last year, paying for them should reflect who benefits most from them.  The state Board of Public Utilities took a different approach recently when it approved New Jerseys biggest utility, Public Service Electric & Gas, to spend $707 million the next four years to install smart meters for 2.3 million customers. Customers will get that bill beginning the next time PSE&G asks for an increase in its base rate for electricity.  One big advantage of the meters for utilities is they allow power usage to be read remotely on a computer. The workers who walk from house to house reading meters wont be needed anymore, eliminating their jobs and substantial costs to utilities. For PSE&G, thats a couple of hundred workers.  The meters also make it easier to manage the power supply, a big help in this age of myriad solar projects putting power into the local grid. And they can detect theft and collect data on customers (which is why we urged New Jersey to set legislative limits on such data collection to preserve privacy).  One smart meter benefit for utilities and customers is pinpointing outages, allowing quicker and more efficient response and repair. The meters also will let customers cut back the power into their homes and businesses at times to trim their bills.  Atlantic City Electric has proposed spending $220 million installing this advanced metering infrastructure for its 560,000 customers throughout South Jersey. The BPUs approval of PSE&Gs plan establishes the framework for approving those of ACE and Jersey Central Power & Light.  ACE customers would pay an additional $4.25 a month or $51 a year for the smart meter project. The utility, which will get most of the benefits, expects to save $220 million over 15 years.  The director of the state Division of the Ratepayer said utilities should pay for smart meters themselves and recoup their investment over time. But under the BPUs scheme, customers will pay for meters that provide lasting savings to utilities and have to hope they recoup their costs in reduced future rate increases granted by the BPU.  We suggested a compromise last year:  Let ACE and its customers split the cost of the meters and after 7.5 years a rate cut could reimburse customers for what they spent on the utilitys new technology.  But it looks like, as with so many costly state clean energy policies, ratepayers will be treated just like taxpayers as a bottomless revenue source for improvement schemes that largely benefit others.',\n",

HOW TO PREPARE A PINEAPPLE  LAY the pineapple on its side and, using a sharp knife, slice off the top and bottom. Make straight, even cuts so you create a flat, stable base on both ends.  Stand the pineapple upright on your cutting board. Securing the pineapple with one hand, the knife with the other, carefully cut from top to bottom to remove the skin. Follow the pineapple\\'s natural curves with your knife. After taking off the skin, remove the brown \"eyes\" or holes that remain on the flesh.  * FOR RINGS: Slice rounds of the pineapple and remove the core - the tough, woody part in the centre - with a knife or a shaped cutter.  * FOR WEDGES: Cut the pineapple lengthways in halves then quarters. Remove the core by slicing each of these at an angle. Slice into wedges.  * FOR CUBES: Cut each of the four quarters into long batons then slice those into smaller cubes.  Store your pineapple in an airtight container in the fridge, for up to a week. Or freeze for up to a year.

       " 'Business Charge investors higher rate to cool housing market - economist Banks should be forced to hold more capital against investor mortgages, pushing up the interest rate to help cool the property market, an economist believes.  Jarrod Kerr, chief economist at Kiwibank, said the rampant housing market had \"surely taken a negative cash rate off the table\". Last year, market expectations were for the official cash rate to go negative this year, but a Government call to the Reserve Bank to take housing into account as part of its decision-making as well as a faster than expected economic recovery has made that less likely.  Kerr said the next best step the Reserve Bank could take would be a reassessment and bank repricing of the risk associated with home loans.  \"The risk weighting on home loans could be adjusted, to better reflect the higher risk associated with interest-only and investor loans.  \"Applying a higher risk weighting on investor mortgages forces banks to hold more capital against those loans, and ultimately price them differently.\"  Kerr said someone walking into a bank with a 30 per cent deposit, to upgrade their home, should receive a lower interest rate than a leveraged investor buying their fifth investment property on interest-only.  Banks have already made it harder for investors to get mortgages.  At the end of last year, ASB and BNZ brought back a 30 per cent deposit requirement for investors and ANZ increased its requirement to 40 per cent ahead of a Reserve Bank plan to bring back a 30 per cent loan to value ratio (LVR) from March.  Westpac said it had not changed its requirements for investors despite the LVR being dropped back in April to make loan deferrals possible as the global pandemic began to bite.  Consultation on bringing back the LVR closed on Friday, with the Reserve Bank expected to make a final decision next month, although most consider it a foregone conclusion that the LVRs will be back.  Kelvin Davidson, senior economist at CoreLogic, believes the Reserve Bank could even consider increasing the LVR to 40 per cent for investors this year.  He said it was almost 99.9 per cent certain there would be a 30 per cent deposit requirement from March 1.  \"Our attention is probably more what happens after that because if you look back to the end of 2016 when a 40 per cent deposit requirement was brought in, back then we had investors with a high share in the market and rapidly rising house prices, politics were in place - something must be done about the housing market. Then we saw a 40 per cent requirement come in.\" Davidson said a lot of those conditions were back in play again. \"Investors\\' share in the market is now about 27 per cent which is as high as it was in 2016. It just feels like everything looks the same. We wouldn\\'t be surprised if we ended up at 40 per cent sooner rather than later.\"',\n",

       " 'Local Task force to oversee Grey County\\'s LTC redevelopment projects Grey County council has chosen the members of a new committee that will oversee the planning stages of projects to redevelop and expand both Grey Gables and Rockwood Terrace into 128-bed long-term care homes.  Along with Warden Selwyn Hicks, the members of the long-term care redevelopment task force will include Grey Highlands Mayor Paul McQueen - whose municipality is home to Grey Gables in Markdale - and West Grey Mayor Christine Robinson - whose municipality includes the Rockwood Terrace site in Durham.  Owen Sound Deputy-mayor Brian O\\'Leary, Georgian Bluffs Mayor Dwight Burley, Chatsworth Mayor Scott Mackey and Southgate Deputy-mayor Brian Milne will also serve on the task force. \"This committee takes us, in my recommendation, to construction drawings,\" Grey County CAO Kim Wingrove told council during a committee of the whole meeting Thursday.  She estimates the planning stages will take about a year. The makeup of the committee can then be revisited once the projects reach the construction tendering phase.  \"The nature of the tasks then change once you commence construction and then you\\'re in more of an oversight position around the various parts of the construction project and dealing with the issues and challenges that can arise as you go through something like that,\" she said. The province announced in September 2019 approval of Grey County\\'s application to add 28 new beds and redevelop 100 existing beds for a new Rockwood Terrace. That current home must be upgraded from a Class C to a Class A facility by 2025.  In November, the Ministry of Long-term Care approved the county\\'s application for 62 new long-term care beds for Grey Gables, part of a proposed county project to create a 128-bed facility in the town. The new Rockwood Terrace is to be built on a 32-acre property adjacent to the current home\\'s site. The property was recently acquired by the county from Durham Stone and Paving Inc., which received, in exchange, a county-owned quarry in Grey Highlands.  The county has retained a consultant, SHS Consulting, to investigate housing options that would complement the proposed new Rockwood Terrace, Wingrove said.  The consultant will be undertaking a market assessment to determine the need and demand for various senior housing options in the area and a business case to assess preferred housing options, she said. Various studies are also being completed to support a site plan for the property.  County officials believe those documents will be ready for council\\'s consideration in the spring.  The county is planning to construct the new Grey Gables on the current site.  A request for proposals from the county closed Friday for a consultant to prepare an assessment and business case on the most appropriate way to repurpose the current home and how that can be integrated into the new building.  Wingrove said she expects that work will wrap up by the summer.',\n",

       " 'Encore News & Commentary Auto-IRA programs are closing the coverage gap; Initiatives in California, Oregon, and Illinois show programs can work Initiatives in California, Oregon, and Illinois show programs can work  Only about half of private sector workers are covered by employer-sponsored retirement savings plans at any given time, and few workers save without one.  As a result, roughly a third of retired households are solely reliant on Social Security benefits for income, with many ending up on safety net programs such as Medicaid. In the absence of federal action to close the coverage gap, a number of states have passed legislation to implement mandatory auto-IRA programs, which expand coverage by requiring employers who do not offer a retirement plan to automatically enroll their workers in an individual retirement account (IRA).  Auto-IRA programs are now up and running in California, Illinois, and Oregon, and the three states (as well as Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, and Colorado, which have enacted the legislation and are preparing to launch) have adopted the same basic program design.  - Employers that do not sponsor a tax-qualified retirement plan must automatically enroll each of their employees in a private sector payroll deduction Roth IRA. The employer has no fiduciary responsibilities and makes no contributions. The programs generally phase in over time, beginning with larger employers.  - As in 401(k) auto-enrollment, employees may at any time opt out or opt for a higher or lower contribution rate than the default of 5%. The default investment is a private sector target-date fund, but employees may opt instead for any of a handful of alternative investments.  - The state contracts for a private sector record-keeper/third-party administrator to provide the IRAs and manage the program and contracts with private sector asset managers to provide the target-date fund and other investment options.  Table 1 below summarizes the particulars. California\\'s CalSavers is still rolling out to the largest employers, but eventually it will be the largest among the auto-IRA states. Illinois was the first state to pass legislation and the second to go \"live,\" in 2018. Unlike Oregon and California, where enrollment is starting with large employers, Illinois applies only to all employers with 25 or more employees. Oregon was the first state to go \"live\" in 2017. It is completing implementation of the program for employers with five or more employees and will soon implement for the smallest employers. As it was the first program to start up, it currently has the most assets and participants. Interestingly, all three states have chosen Ascensus as their record-keeper and State Street Global as at least one of their investment managers.  In short, state auto-IRA programs are a reality. And even in the wake of COVID-19, they continue to grow. The time has come to establish a national auto-IRA program so that workers in all states have a way to save for retirement - and have money on hand in case of emergencies.',\n",
       " 'News & Analysis Management fee discounts disappear from sight The number of funds coming to market openly offering discounts for early bird commitments or big ticket sizes is dropping, according to research seen exclusively by Private Equity International.  The number of funds coming to market offering a discount on management fees is dwindling, according to new research seen exclusively by sister publication Private Equity International.  Just 12 percent of the funds included in MJ Hudson\\'s annual fund terms survey included the possibility of discounted fees in their LPAs. This represents a drop from the 2019 figure, which was 17 percent, and 2018 (24 percent).  The legal and fund services firm collated the fund term data from PE and venture capital funds seen by its LP and GP clients during 2019 and part of 2020. Of the funds, 41 percent were buyout, 32 percent growth capital and 21 percent VC funds. Other asset classes, such as infrastructure and private debt, were excluded from the study.  Discounts are frequently granted confidentially by a side letter, noted the report, so it is difficult to ascertain the extent of fee discounting in the market. However, discounts are often offered with transparency as incentives for LPs to either commit early to a fundraise or to write a larger check.  Headline fees and carried interest  While 2 percent is still the most commonly seen headline management fee rate - applying to 52 percent of recent fundraises by number - it only applies to a fifth of the total capital raised. The bulk of capital raised (44 percent) is subject to a headline management fee of 1.5 percent or less.  Most funds (91 percent) set carried interest at the conventional 20 percent rate, but nearly a quarter of funds (22.7 percent) offer a tiered or stepped carry arrangement, whereby the initial baseline carry share of 20 percent increases once a certain threshold is met.  \"Our year-on-year research suggests this trend is growing, but we note that our sample this year also includes a slightly greater proportion of growth and turnaround funds, which may account for the change here,\" the report noted.  The report continues: \"Alternative carried interest models included within this year\\'s sample of funds included those where investors can opt for another class of fund interest bearing a higher carried interest rate and compensated by a lower management fee, or where investors are given the option to select different carried interest rates. This is usually linked to paying different management fee rates, with higher carried interest offset by a lower management fee.\"  Other findings from the report:  This year a higher proportion of US managers are using European whole-fund distribution models.  There\\'s evidence that the 8 percent hurdle rate is under challenge, with almost one-third of funds having no preferred return at all (a 6 percentage point increase on last year\\'s findings).

       " 'Business Women investors start to address the gender gap INVESTMENT Platforms report a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic  Women are signing up to investment platforms at faster rates than men, as investors flock to trading to take advantage of market volatility and lower prices.  Investors h ave registered on platforms in record numbers since March and trading volumes have remained heightened since the market sell-off earlier this year. Women are under-represented on investment platforms, but as new and younger customers sign up, they are making up a larger chunk of that base.  EToro, a DIY trading platform, reported a 366 per cent rise in the number of new women investors since the beginning of the year, compared with a 248 per cent increase for men.  Nutmeg, a UK online wealth manager, said customer signups are up nearly one-third in 2020. Women ordinarily make up 36 per cent of its investors, but this year the female share of new customers rose to 40 per cent.  Bux, a European investment platform, said female customers signing up to its trading app BuxZero grew sixfold over the year to date, compared with fourfold growth for men.  Nannette Hechler-Fayd\\'herbe, global head of economics and research at Credit Suisse, noted in a recent report that women\\'s emphasis on financial security can lead them to hold excess cash and lower returns later in life. Though women own 40 per cent of the world\\'s wealth in real terms, they represent a far lower proportion of those engaged with the stock market or wealth managers.  Customers of retail investment platforms and wealth management firms are typically men on eToro the approximate breakdown is 85 per cent male to 15 per cent female. Some 70 per cent of Interactive Investor\\'s customers are men, and the customer base of Hargreaves Lansdown, the UK\\'s largest investment platform, is two-thirds male.  Female investors are unfairly stereotyped as more risk averse and uninformed than men, advisers say. In reality, their strategies tend to reflect their goals and a desire to keep cash safe, prioritising long-term stability. Women may be more likely to hold cash than men but as interest rates on savings and yields on lower-risk investments such as bonds have declined, investment has become more attractive, with women seeing it as imperative to keep up with inflation.  \"To see more women investing is incredibly positive,\" said Kat Mann, savings and investment specialist at Nutmeg. \"At a time when savings accounts and interests rates offer poor value, holding more money than is needed in cash could be having a long-term damaging effect on finances.\"  Lockdowns have reduced spending, increased savings and expanded the time women have to think about financial planning.  \"Women are interested in investing, they\\'re just short on time, especially mothers,\" said Becky O\\'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor. \"They\\'re time poor, so rarely does investing make the top of the priority list.\"',\n",

In its latest results, the company reported a 148% increase in online sales, including a 184% rise in sales of electric bikes.  The temporary vacancies are in addition to the recruitment of a wide range of permanent service-related jobs across Halford\\'s stores, Autocentres and mobile vans.  Andy McBride, Halfords\\' head of resourcing, said: \"With the public turning to alternatives to public transport, this has led to extra demand for bikes and essential motoring services.\"  Halfords cycling director Paul Tomlinson said: \"There has been huge interest in cycling this year as the public seek alternatives to public transport and as a way of keeping fit.  \"As a result we\\'ve seen a massive surge in demand and sales of bikes and cycling products.  \"We have had tens of thousands of customers on waiting lists for deliveries and this has continued beyond the traditional summer peak, particularly for adult bikes as lockdown continues.  \"Kids\\' and junior bikes also appear to be one of the most wanted Christmas presents this year.  \"We\\'ve also seen e-bikes perform particularly well as many discover the benefits of a battery-powered bike ride.\"  Halfords has emerged as one of the winners from lockdown as it reported its first half profits were more than double last year\\'s.  The cars and bikes firm reported revenues of £638.9million in six months running to October 2, with profits before tax of £55.4million -up 101.5% on the same period last year.

The annual flash sale is a must for millions across the world ahead of Christmas - so all tips come in handy.

Staying ahead of the chaos could land you some mega bargains.  So here\\'s some ways you can stay ahead of the game on one of the most frantic shopping days of the year.  It\\'s all about the research  Know what you are buying to save some important time.  It\\'s not much use grabbing a bargain when the pressure is on if the product is not actually what you want. So, do your homework.  Also, research your product\\'s price history - it may not be the deal you actually think it is!  Write that wishlist!  Black Friday pros know it\\'s all about organisation.  Some websites even let you set up a list for all the things you want to buy.  Avoid trawling - precision lands you the bargains so make sure you are on the ball and ready to buy!

Roger Ferguson, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, is stepping down from his role as CEO of Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America, effective March 31. The move comes amid speculation that Ferguson may be tapped by the Biden administration for a cabinet position, including potentiallyTreasury secretary.  In a statement, TIAA said its board and Ferguson \"believe it is an appropriate time to identify a successor who can own TIAA\\'s strategy for years to come and work with Mr. Ferguson to ensure an effective transition of leadership.\" The board is working with an executive search firm to look within the firm and outside for possible successors.  If Ferguson does join the Biden administration, he would become one of the highest-ranking officials with direct experience grappling with America\\'s retirement crisis following years of low rates, slow growth, widening income inequality, and a fraying safety net.  In an interview with Barron\\'s in 2019, Ferguson said the crisis was getting worse: \"The average 401(k) balance is not enough to retire on. We have 10,000 baby boomers reaching so-called retirement age every day. One, frankly, folks just aren\\'t saving enough. Two, we don\\'t have [the guarantees of] the old-fashioned pensions anymore. Three, some core systems like Social Security need repair.\"  One of the highest-ranking Black executives on Wall Street, Ferguson positioned TIAA and Nuveen as critical to getting people safely to and through retirement and providing financial literacy, advocating target-date funds, fixed annuities and alternatives that would diversity from equities and help replicate old-fashioned defined-benefit pensions.  After earning a law degree and a doctorate in economics at Harvard, he became a corporate lawyer and, later, a McKinsey consultant who oversaw the firm\\'s financial-services practice for more than 10 years, advising banks and other companies about improving operations and returns. Then his grad-school friend Larry Summers, an economist serving at the time at the White House, tapped him to join the Fed. Ferguson became vice chairman.  Ferguson took over leadership of TIAA-famous for managing pensions for college professors, including Albert Einstein-in 2008, as the global financial crisis was unfolding. There he had a close-up view of America\\'s retirement problems.  Then, after steering TIAA through the financial crisis, he acquired Nuveen and other companies, adding nearly a million new retirement clients and driving assets above $1 trillion. He pushed for passage of the Secure Act to broaden access to retirement accounts and bolstered the firm\\'s expertise in environmental, social and governance investing. Among other things, he also steered the firm through a controversy over improper sales practices.

The change, which could affect as many as 85,000 people, comes afterfour single mums won a Court of Appeal case against the DWP earlier this year.  Their case centred around a problem that arises when those claimingUniversal Creditreceive their income from work on a different day because their usual pay day falls on a weekend or a bank holiday.  As a result, theDWP systemsometimes counts them as having been paid twice in one Universal Credit assessment period - substantially reducing their benefit payment and causing large fluctuations in their monthly income.  It also reduces their work allowance, which means they receive less money than they would otherwise be entitled to.  How to get the latest Scottish news stories sent straight to your inbox with our newsletters  DWP confirms payment dates for benefits including Universal Credit, PIP and State Pension over Christmas and New Year  The four working mothers initially won a High Court challenge against theSecretary of State for Work and Pensions (SSWP) in January 2019and at the time said the shifting payments had left them struggling financially, resulting in them falling into rent arrears, defaulting on Council Tax, incurring bank overdraft charges and forced to rely on food banks.  TheSSWPthen brought an appeal against the High Court\\'s decision, but it was rejected by the Court of Appeal in a ruling on June 22, 2020.  Judges instructed the UK Government to fix the issue with theUniversal Credit welfare schemewhich causes \"considerable hardship\" for tens of thousands of working families after ruling it as \"irrational\".  And now, from Monday, November 16, claimants who get paid twice in one month by their employer will no longer suffer cuts to theirUniversal Credit payments.  The benefits system will only register one payment for every one-month Universal Credit assessment period to stop anyone losing out.  Jobs Widget  The upcoming festive season includesfour bank holidays for Scottish claimants- Christmas Day, December 28 in lieu of Boxing Day falling on a Saturday, New Year\\'s Day and January 4, also in lieu of January 2 falling on a Saturday.  The rule change means anyone whose salary arrives earlier or later over that period, resulting in them ending up with two pay days in one assessment period, won\\'t be penalised in theirUniversal Credit payment.  Financial help available in Scotland  Minister for welfare delivery, Will Quince, said: \"Universal Credit is a flexible benefit, and we continue to make changes and improvements to make sure people have the best experience possible.  \"This change will give stability to people if they\\'re paid two pay cheques in a single assessment period, by ensuring that their Universal Credit payments remain consistent.\"',\n",

With the ups and downs the market has experienced since the start of the pandemic, it\\'s important that working Americans understand their various financial and retirement planning options.  According to a recent survey from the Center for a Secure Retirement and Bankers Life, more than half (54%) of working adults say their retirement planning has taken a hit amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than a third (36%) having lost money in the stock market.  Whether you\\'re 25, 35 or 45, it\\'s never too early-or late-to start financially planning for retirement. Additional insight from the Center for Secure Retirement shows that nearly two-thirds (63%) of those age 35 to 44 reported that the pandemic has impacted their future retirement, compared to just one-third (35%) of those 65 and older.  A moment of upheaval like that experienced amid COVID-19-which has been particularly felt by those reliant on employer sponsored plans like a 401-represents an opportunity for the next generation of retirees to review their options and ensure their financial security.  Here are smart actions to take:  -Stay calm. The uncertainty of the market can cause panic for some. Financial planning experts advise that the best thing you can do is to refrain from impulsive decisions. Stay calm and avoid any emotional or risky moves when it comes to large investments.  -Reevaluate. Even for those who may feel confident in their retirement planning, it is important to continually reevaluate as you receive new information during the pandemic. It can be tempting to focus on short term gains at the expense of long-term plans.  -Be flexible. It may even be beneficial to schedule reviews of your retirement plans several times over the course of the year, as the state of the world is everchanging. Continuously revisiting and adjusting your plans will ensure that you are prepared for the future no matter what it may bring.  -Supplement savings.

It may even be beneficial to schedule reviews of your retirement plans several times over the course of the year, as the state of the world is everchanging. Continuously revisiting and adjusting your plans will ensure that you are prepared for the future no matter what it may bring.  -Supplement savings. Consider including life insurance as part of your retirement plan to supplement your savings and provide peace of mind for you and your loved ones.  Although life during a pandemic is uncertain and difficult to navigate, by seeking help to better understand your financial plans and current health care coverage, you\\'ll be more prepared to anticipate unforeseen situations in the future.  -Bankers Life is the marketing brand of Bankers Life and Casualty Company, Medicare Supplement insurance policies sold by Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company and select policies sold in New York by Bankers Conseco Life Insurance Company .

       " 'Elk Grove Village plans another round of $200 water bill credits... Elk Grove Village plans another round of $200 water bill credits  While discussions in Washington have stalled over a second federal stimulus bill, residents in one Northwest suburban community are expected to be on the receiving end of that town\\'s second coronavirus relief package since the pandemic took hold.  Elk Grove Village officials announced Tuesday a second round of $200 residential water bill credits set to take effect with upcoming January and February bills. Worth $3 million in total, the credits would apply to all 11,500 single-family homes, townhouses and condominiums in town.  It follows the village\\'s initial $3.2 million coronavirus relief package in March, in what was an unprecedented move for a Northwest suburban municipality at the time. Officials gave water bill credits to residents while waiving various licensing fees for businesses.  At a village board meeting Tuesday night, Mayor Craig Johnson said the economic relief, while small, could help \"take off a little bit of the edge\" for residents who are struggling amid the financial effects of the pandemic.  \"When bills and credit cards come after the holidays, you\\'re going to have a couple extra dollars left for you to cover some expenses,\" Johnson said. \"The board is excited to be able to do that for the community.\"  While formal approval is expected next month, the mayor said trustees are on board with the proposal. He said he came to the realization that the village could provide another local stimulus when he saw the latest financial numbers two weeks ago.  Specifically, the village\\'s reserve fund next spring is projected to be $23 million, about $3 million more than expected per the village\\'s standard of having enough to cover five months of operating expenses.  Much of the town\\'s financial strength can be attributed to its 6-square-mile industrial park, which has been \"humming\" even in the middle of the pandemic, Johnson said.  He said 90% of businesses located there - deemed essential - never shut down. That includes one company that makes a wiring component for ventilators and another that makes bottles for hand sanitizer.  By July, sales tax revenues for the business park were back to normal, officials said. The park alone generates $24 million a year in sales taxes for village coffers.  \"If we\\'re doing that well, we want to give back to the community,\" Johnson said. \"We were built to handle something like this.\"  The average residential water bill in Elk Grove is $84, so officials anticipate most customers will be able to take advantage of the credit for two or three billing cycles. The village is requiring landlords to pass savings to their tenants, and likewise condo associations to their unit owners.  Johnson said the village has time before next June to decide whether to waive annual business licensing fees again. In the first stimulus package, it was worth $180,000 villagewide.',\n",

       " 'Mortgages Buyers urged to house hunt now to save on stamp duty Homebuyers should start their property search by November 1 to avoid missing out on the stamp duty holiday, according to Legal & General.  The L&G mortgage club estimates home buying currently takes up to 15 weeks, or 17 weeks for buyers with more complex requirements.  However, it added the timeline does not take into account the holiday season, or the impact of a potential second lockdown, which prospective buyers should factor into their plans.  Legal & General said buyers should begin their search by November 1 to benefit from the stamp duty holiday and to give themselves sufficient time for any issues before completion.  The mortgage club warned the mortgage application process was taking longer since the market reopened after lockdown.  In a survey of approximately 50 brokers between September and October, three in 10 advisers (30 per cent) quoted timelines between three and four weeks, while 32 per cent quoted four to eight weeks.  Borrowers with more complex backgrounds, such as an impaired credit history or who have been on furlough, may need to allow up to six to eight weeks (28 per cent) to get approval for a mortgage.  In comparison, a mortgage application for a consumer with straightforward circumstances took less than two weeks to move to offer before the pandemic.  The mortgage club also found increased lead times elsewhere in the housing sector, with conveyancers indicating the time between offer and exchange was taking three weeks, and the period between exchange and completion at one to two weeks.  Kevin Roberts, director at Legal & General Mortgage Club, said: \"As homebuyers rush to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday, policy makers need to consider if a tapering of the stamp duty deadline is needed instead of a hard deadline.  \"We need to avoid those moving or purchasing a home missing out through delays after March 31 when the holiday ends.\"  Aly Kassam, director at Easier Finances, commented: \"With some lenders taking up to four weeks to deal with initial underwriting, November 1 seems to be a sensible point to aim for, but December 1 seems doable, allowing a total of 16 weeks to the deadline.  \"Many lenders are instructing valuations on application submission, so choosing your lender carefully, not just based on price, but also service levels is a prudent approach to take and can really demonstrate the value of a broker, over using comparison sites to determine the \\'cheapest\\' deal. Missing the stamp duty holiday could cost a homebuyer up to £15,000, so value and service are paramount.  \"Unless clients are prepared to move full steam ahead with the conveyance, incurring costs for searches and other disbursements to be ahead of the game where the mortgage is approved, 16 weeks is a reasonable expectation to set with clients.\"  chloe.cheung@ft.com  What do you think about the issues raised by this story?

       " \"Condo Questions News Can condo board ditch water loss coverage to lower insurance costs?; Property act sets out exactly what perils condo corporations are obliged to include Q I am on the board of our highrise condominium building. The corporation's insurance policy has come up for renewal. The quote on our new insurance policy is extremely expensive for our building. Our building has had a lot of water loss claims. To save costs, the board has decided to forgo water loss coverage. Is this legal? A The short answer to your question is: No, this is not legal. Your condominium complex must have water loss coverage.  Section 47(1)(a) of the Condominium Property Act states that a condominium corporation must place and maintain insurance on the units and the common property against loss resulting from destruction or damage caused by any prescribed peril.  Section 61 of the Condominium Property Regulation sets out what perils specifically a condominium corporation must place and maintain insurance against, which include fire; lightning; smoke; windstorm; hail; explosion of natural, coal or manufactured gas; water damage caused by flood; water damage caused by sewer backup or the sudden and accidental escape of water or steam from within a plumbing, heating, sprinkler or air conditioning system or a domestic appliance that is located within an insured building; among other perils.  Therefore, the corporation's obligation to have insurance in place for any of the prescribed perils, which includes water loss coverage, is clear. The corporation must maintain insurance on all units and common property against water loss.  There is, however, room to allow for certain commercial realities. Section 61(6) of the regulation states that a corporation will be compliant with its statutory insurance obligations, even where the insurance obtained is subject to certain limitations or exclusions, provided that such are reasonable in the circumstances. The Alberta Courts have not interpreted this section and therefore, I cannot provide any definitive answer as to the application of s. 61(6) of the Regulation.  Helpful Hint: The Condominium Property Act and the Condominium Property Regulation require condominium corporations to place and maintain insurance for all prescribed perils. However, condominium corporations are capable of negotiating coverage limits and deductibles, or premium rates, provided they still have coverage as provided for in the Act and Regulation.

       " \"Money Blow for UK's power supply: National Grid warns lack of wind could plunge Britain into darkness Britain's electricity could be in short supply over the next few days because of a lack of wind.  Electricity grid operator National Grid warned 'unusually low wind output' and a series of power plant outages would squeeze the network until early next week, leaving it with less back-up power than normal.  National Grid said it would 'make sure there is enough generation' to prevent blackouts.  But the warning will also put pressure on the Government to invest in other power sources in addition to wind, which can be unreliable.  Last night National Grid said there was 'adequate' power for today and that it would keep monitoring the situation over the weekend.  The balance of wind-generated power in the electricity mix will drop to as low as 9 per cent and 10.5 per cent tomorrow and on Sunday respectively, before climbing back up to 51 per cent on Monday, the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) estimates.  Wind power has sometimes provided up to 60 per cent of power in the grid.  The UK has more offshore wind capacity than any other country - and power produced from the sector charges the equivalent of 4.5m homes each year.  The ECIU reported that a number of gas plants, such as Cowes on the Isle of Wight and Shoreham, West Sussex, as well as a biomass plant in Lynemouth in Northumberland and at least one coal-operated plant, had seen generator failures.  There are also two planned outages at two of the UK's nuclear reactors, Dungeness, Kent, and Hunterston B in North Ayrshire.  In a tweet, the National Grid Electricity System Operator said: 'Unusually low wind output coinciding with a number of generator outages means the cushion of space capacity we operate the system with has been reduced.  'We're exploring measures and actions to make sure there is enough generation available to increase our buffer capacity.'  It is the second warning from the grid operator in a month. In mid-September it warned the electricity marker that its 'buffer' of power reserves had fallen below 500MW and it could need to call on more power plants to help prevent a blackout. This notice was later withdrawn.  During the national lockdown earlier this year, the network was inundated with extra power.  National Grid had to spend £50million on the second May Bank Holiday weekend alone to pay power producers - including surplus wind and solar farms - to switch off.  It spent almost £1billion on extra interventions to prevent blackouts during the first half of the year and also handed out money to EDF Energy to halve the amount of power generated at its Sizewell B nuclear plant.  Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said the latest warning 'underscores the urgency of investing in new nuclear capacity, to secure reliable, always-on, emissions-free power, alongside other zero-carbon sources'.\",\n",
       " 'A-Section Federal retirement benefits to be increased by 1.3 percent in January Federal retirement benefits will be increased by 1.3 percent in January, the same as the upcoming increase in Social Security benefits that was announced Tuesday.  The cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA, will go to almost all of the nearly 2.2 million federal retirees plus about 500,000 survivor beneficiaries. The figure is about average for the past 10 years, when the increases have been as much as 3.6 percent; a 1.6 percent increase was paid at the start of this year.  The increase applies only to annuity benefits for retirees, not to the salaries of current federal employees. Retiree COLAs are set automatically by an inflation index whose annual count concluded with the announcement Tuesday of figures through September.  In contrast, current employees receive pay raises set through the annual government budget process. No decision has been reached regarding a raise in January 2021.  President Trump has recommended a 1 percent pay raise, while Congress has taken no position. If no figure is enacted into law by the end of the year, that amount will take effect automatically. Some members of Congress continue to advocate for increasing the figure to 3 percent to match the planned raise for military personnel.  For retirees, some COLA policies vary depending on which of the two main federal retirement systems applies to them.  All of those who retired under the Civil Service Retirement System - which applies only to employees first hired before 1984 - receive a full COLA regardless of age. Although that program applies only to about 5 percent of current federal employees, 59 percent of retirees, or just under 1.3 million, draw their benefits from it.  Those retired under the newer Federal Employees Retirement System do not receive inflation adjustments until passing age 62, unless they were disabled or worked in positions requiring earlier retirement, such as law enforcement.  Under both systems, inflation adjustments are reduced for those who have been retired for less than a year at the time of a payout.  As of September 2019, the average monthly benefit under the CSRS was $3,939, and the average FERS benefit was $1,576. After accounting for the increase paid in January, the upcoming COLA will be worth about $52 and $21 per month on average, respectively.  Average benefits to survivors of deceased retirees - which also are inflation-adjusted - were $1,710 and $620 per month under the CSRS and the FERS, respectively, a year ago.  The FERS program yields a smaller benefit because it factors in Social Security coverage and employer contributions toward Thrift Savings Plan retirement accounts, two features that are absent from the CSRS program.  The value of the inflation adjustment commonly is compared with the average increase in premiums under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, in which most federal retirees remain enrolled. The Office of Personnel Management has not announced rates for 2021.  eric.yoder@washpost.com   http://www.washingtonpost.com  WP20201015fedcola',\n",

       " 'Money You What is probate? Do we have to pay a death tax in Canada? No - we do not.  In the United States, death tax is required on all assets of the deceased and calculated at the date of death. This is not something we do in Canada. Probate \"tax\" is determined provincially and is very different from our U.S. neighbours.  Essentially, probate is a court proceeding that provides a judicial approval that the will provided is not to be contested, that it is the only will in existence, and that the executor has the authority to act and be recognized by the courts. All banks, investment companies and financial institutions usually require a probated will to ensure they are dealing with the authorized executor. If there are any lawsuits or claims against the estate the will must always be probated.  Probate is a fee that varies by province. In some provinces it is a fixed amount while other provinces charge a prescribed rate on the gross value of the estate. Prescribed rate: Nova Scotia, Ontario, British Columbia Set fee structure: New Brunswick, P.E.I., Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, N.W.T. Administration fee: Quebec So are there ways to reduce the probate fee?  Yes.\\\\ One way would be to have assets bypass probate and pass directly to beneficiaries. TFSAs, RRSPs, RRIFs or the proceeds of life insurance are not subject to probate however the tax associated with any registered plans will need to be paid by the estate and therefore one should always ensure your estate has liquidity. Another way to avoid the potential cost of probate would be to \"gift\" cash or assets to family members prior to death. It is advisable to discuss this option with a good tax accountant to ensure there are no adverse income tax consequences.  Property can also be sidestepped from probate by simply holding it in joint tenancy with right of survivorship. This is how most spouses hold assets - jointly so that property passes to the survivor on the first death with no requirement to obtain probate. Be careful if you plan to transfer title of a property to anyone other than a spouse. You may need a written declaration to prove that there is a clear intention to transfer the beneficial interest in the asset from sole ownership to joint tenancy with right of survivorship.  A declaration ensures the asset is not subject to probate but you still may be on the hook for capital gains tax which will be triggered upon title transfer as a deemed disposition at fair market value. Remember to seek professional advice. Talk to your accountant, your adviser or your estate planner. They will know your situation best and can provide other ways to avoid probate.

       " 'The Property Report Foreclosures Set to Rise In Commercial Sector The pandemic came at a bad time for the Burnsville Center mall near Minneapolis. In May, Macy\\'s Inc. said it would close its store. J.C. Penney Co., which has a store at the mall, filed for bankruptcy.  Owner CBL & Associates Properties Inc. risked losing the mall if it stopped making payments on the $63 million mortgage. Instead, the company overseeing CBL\\'s securitized mortgage agreed to defer payments for three months, according to the loan servicer\\'s commentary collected by data firm Trepp LLC.  But CBL didn\\'t pay off the loan after three months. Now, Burnsville Center is one of hundreds of properties in the U.S. heading to foreclosure.  CBL didn\\'t respond to requests for comment.  Lenders, for the most part, were initially happy to grant debt forbearance and hope the pandemic would end soon. But many now expect the pandemic\\'s effects to linger for a long time. As forbearance periods expire, more lenders are going after properties or demanding additional capital in exchange for extending relief.  Recent, high-profile foreclosure proceedings include Chicago\\'s Palmer House Hilton hotel and a portfolio of luxury apartment developments in New York City. Behind the scenes, more lenders are starting negotiations to take over properties from their borrowers, said Jay Neveloff, a partner at law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP.  Across the U.S., 278 properties backing securitized mortgages were in foreclosure as of last week, according to Trepp, and at least 80 of them had financial problems related to Covid-19. Real-estate attorneys and executives say they expect foreclosures to increase.  \"It\\'s coming,\" said Jay Olshonsky, chief executive of real-estate-services firm NAI Global. \"It\\'s just a question of how bad is it going to be.\"  He expects foreclosures in commercial real estate caused by the pandemic to be far worse than what happened during and after the 2007-09 recession, when properties backing tens of billions of dollars in commercial mortgages ended up in foreclosure.  The slumping travel and restaurant industries, as well as store closures, made hotels and shopping malls the most immediately vulnerable. But some investors say they expect more apartment and office buildings to end up in foreclosure. \"We\\'ve never had a situation where people weren\\'t paying their rent on their apartments, like we have now,\" Mr. Olshonsky said.  CWCapital, a so-called special servicer that oversees securitized mortgages whose borrowers are late on payments or otherwise in trouble, granted forbearance on roughly $2 billion in loans in the spring, according to its president, James Shevlin.  Still, foreclosures remain an exception. Banks, which are getting plenty of leeway from regulators, have been more willing to grant long forbearance periods and extend them if necessary. Many nonbank lenders are more eager to foreclose, but often lack the staff to handle all the troubled properties. Meanwhile, a number of states, including New York, have put moratoria on foreclosures.',\n",
       " 'Money,Shopping,Shopping advice BE KIND Customers urged to be patient and kind in new shop posters after workers suffer abuse SHOPPERS are being urged to be patient and kind in new shop posters after workers suffer abuse.  It comes after research found that violence and abuse against shop workers has doubled during the coronavirus crisis.  Retail staff members have been assaulted, threatened or abused at least once a week on average since the start of the coronavirus outbreak, according to the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw).  This compares to just once a fortnight last year.  While not all shopworkers suffer to this extent, some experience much worse with one in six being abused on every shift, Usdaw said in April.  The survey came after supermarkets called for police protection in March, over fears panic-buying could lead to rioting.  In June, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also warned shoppers not to abuse staff as shops reopened after the relaxation of lockdown rules.  The Federation of Independent Retailers (NFRN), which represents 15,000 stores across the UK and Ireland, has now created two posters to help protect its members and encourage customers to shop responsibly.  The first poster appeals to shoppers to respect those working in shops by being \"patient, kind and to wear a mask\".  While the second explains why both shop staff and customers should cover up their faces while shopping.  Face masks are currently compulsory in a wide range of places, such as public transport, hospitals, shops as well as museums, places of worship and cinemas.  If you don\\'t wear one, you face being slapped with a £200 fine.  The NFRN has created the new posters for its members to display within their stores as coronavirus restrictions increase again.  Last month, the NFRN urged Boris Johnson to provide effective legal protection for shop workers amid rising levels of abuse and violence.  It\\'s also called on Yvette Cooper, chair of the home affairs committee, to launch an inquiry into retail violence.  Stuart Reddish, its national president, said: \"Covid-19 has been challenging for everyone.  \"In the main, customers have adhered to the guidelines but some members have experienced hostility and frustration and, sadly, in some instances have even been subject to abuse and threats.  \"We hope that by seeing these posters, customers will treat independent retailers and their staff with greater understanding and respect, which means protecting everyone\\'s health and safety.\"  Mr Reddish added: \"I get calls from hundreds of retailers who are crime victims.  \"The impact of retail crime can be devastating and long-lasting - not just in terms of physical injuries but on anxiety and stress too.\"  Last year, Co-op launched a campaign for stronger protection for shop workers.  It came after figures showed that 115 shop workers are attacked every day, working out as 42,000 violent incidents a year.

For those whose finances have been impaired by the pandemic, any refund would be likely to be used to help meet living expenses. Those in a more fortunate financial position might be looking for other ways to put their tax refunds to work. Here are five top tips from the experts.  Pay off credit card debt  Jonathan Philpot, a partner at HLB Mann Judd Wealth Management NSW, says paying down expensive debt should be the number one priority.  \"Credit card debt is the main one that you have to try and get out of the way as quickly as possible,\" Philpot says. \"Even though borrowing [interest] rates are low, credit card rates can still be more than 15 per cent and nothing you can do [with the refund] is going to give a return anything like that.\"  Personal, car finance  The next debt to pay down would be any personal loans, including car finance, that generally have an interest rate of between 5 per cent and 7 per cent, he says.  superannuation  Boosting your superannuation is also a good option, Philpot says.  There is a tax break on cash added to super when it is a concessional contribution and, once inside the fund, the money is subject to concessional tax rates.  You can claim a tax deduction on any personal concessional contributions, Philpot says.  For those with incomes up to $39,837, there is a super co-contribution scheme, under which for each added dollar of after-tax contributions put into a fund, the government contributes a matching 50 cents. The government contribution is capped at $500. The co-contribution phases out up to an income of $54,837, before it cuts out.  Invest in shares  Belay Advisory financial planner Richard Felice says you could seed an investment in shares with your tax refund. For those who can invest for several years to ride out inevitable market volatility, it can be a great way to grow wealth.  Felice says a fund with a diversified share portfolio that is \"actively managed\" is a good option. He says \"active management\", where the money manager selects investments with the aim of producing returns that are superior to sharemarkets, after fees, tends to be a better option when markets are volatile than \"passive investments\", which mirror the returns of markets.  Emergency money  WLM Financial director and financial planner Laura Menschik says it is also a good idea to keep some emergency cash on the side. Three months\\' normal income is recommended. However, rather than just keeping it locked away in a term deposit or an online savings account, those buying their own home could look at parking their refund in an offset account attached to their mortgage so the money is effectively earning the mortgage interest rate while still being easily accessible, if required.',\n",
       " 'UK News How people save for their first home as it could take five years Mortgage experts have given five tips  First time homebuyers in Britain are cutting down on pints to afford a new home, according to new research by UK mortgage advice company firstmortgage.co.uk.  Research shows people need to save a £26,000 deposit for their ideal first home -a two-bedroom property.  Top saving methods include cutting out close to 3000 litres of pub-bought beers and not going on holidays to afford it.  A third of first home buyers revealed they did not have a fixed amount they saved each month to put towards buying their first home.  But when asked what they were doing to achieve their savings goals, a third reduced their eating out habits, 32% saved by not going on their holiday and some even moved back in with their parents 18%.  If the average pint costs £5, then Brits need to skip 5,200 pints at the pub to afford an average deposit, whereas for an average city break of £350 for a few days, Brits need to forgo 74 holidays for a weekend on the couch.  First home buyer Sophie Parkin said: \"We had to be tight with our savings, we had a spreadsheet of all of our incomings and outgoings. We had a savings target each month that we had to hit, and we packed lunches, cancelled social occasions, and got rid of subscriptions to be able to meet it.  \"It\\'s worth it though now we are in our own home.\"  The country\\'s super savers hail from Yorkshire 39%, Scotland 31% and the South East 28% who have saved in a year, while as a nation, it averages 3 years.  However, the nations\\' slowest savers South West 41%, North East 36% & London 25% say that it would take them five years to put together a deposit.  First Mortgage spokesperson David McGrail said: \"It might seem harder than ever to get on to the property ladder in a world full of economic uncertainty, however it is possible if you want it.  \"Our advice to first home buyers in this climate is to take advantage. With overseas travel limited, government support through the reduction of stamp duty, and less socialising, it is prime time to get your finances in order and create a plan to get your dream home.\"  TOP FIVE TIPS FROM FIRST MORTGAGE EXPERTS :  * If you can, move back in with your parents and pay your usual rent into a savings account.  * Plan ahead with meals and cook from home, forgoing a £20 meal out a week can save you over a grand  * Cut back on holidays, look local to explore free and new places  * Get your takeaway caffeine habit under control and pack a coffee from home instead  * Be disciplined and set targets for weekly/monthly savings.

The majority of jobs losses will be back office roles in the insurance and wealth management parts of the business.  However 226 new jobs will be created at the bank which employs 65,000 people in total, reducing the overall number of job losses to 639.  The bank warned of job cuts back in January as part of a restructuring but it put the plans on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic.  Those affected will not leave until November at the earliest and the bank aims to redeploy staff where possible.  A Lloyds spokesperson said: \"We will seek to redeploy wherever possible, with all colleagues given access to a package of training and support designed to help them secure their next position, whether within or outside of the group.\"  NatWest, which is part of Lloyds Banking Group, announced it\\'s cutting 550 jobs and closing its London office.  What are my redundancy rights?  BEFORE making you unemployed, your employer should still carry out a fair redundancy process.  You are entitled to be consulted on the redundancy lay-off first and to receive a statutory redundancy payment, as long as you\\'ve been working somewhere for at least two years.  How much you\\'re entitled to depends on your age and length of service, although this is capped at 20 years. You\\'ll get:  * Half a week\\'s pay for each full year you were under 22,  * One week\\'s pay for each full year you were 22 or older, but under 41,  * One and half week\\'s pay for each full year you were 41 or older.  Sadly, you won\\'t be entitled to a payout if you\\'ve been working for your employer for fewer than two years.  There should be a period of collective consultation as well as time for individual ones if your employer wants to make 20 or more employees redundant within 90 days or each other.  You are also entitled to appeal the decision by claiming unfair dismissal within three months of being let go.  The Co-Operative Bank has announced plans to cut 350 jobs and close 18 branches.  The banking industry has struggled with profitability in recent years in the face of a number of factors, such as historically low interest rates, the rise of online banking and changes to banking rules.  This has led to job cuts and branch closures even before the coronavirus pandemic hit.  Lloyds Banking Group swung to a £676m loss in the second quarter of 2020 and warned of the cost of coronavirus.  Lloyds was this week banned from forcing bounce back loan borrowers to sign up to its paid-for business account.  Employers across the UK planned to make more than 300,000 workers redundant in June and July due to coronavirus.',\n",
       " 'UK confirms plan to extend age for accessing private pensions From 2028 individuals will have to be 57 rather than 55 to draw from their retirement savings  Millions of people in the UK younger than their late forties will have to wait an additional two years to dip into their retirement funds after the government confirmed plans to raise the minimum pension access age to 57 in 2028.  Since pension rules were relaxed in 2015, millions of individuals have taken advantage of new freedoms over how they can take cash from their private pension pots from the age of 55.\\xa0  However, on Thursday the government confirmed it would legislate to enact proposals, first mooted six years ago, to increase the minimum access age from 55 to 57 in 2028.  \"In 2014 the government announced it would increase the minimum pension age to 57 from 2028, reflecting trends in longevity and encouraging individuals to remain in work, while also helping to ensure pension savings provide for later life,\" said John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, in response to a written question from Stephen Timms, a Labour MP.\\xa0\\xa0  \"That announcement set out the timetable for this change well in advance to enable people to make financial plans and will be legislated for in due course.\"\\xa0\\xa0  In 2014, the government said the change would apply to all pension schemes aside from those in the public sector that link their normal pension age to the state pension age, such as those for firefighters, the police and the armed forces.  Steven Cameron, pensions director with Aegon, a pensions provider, said the announcement clarified lingering uncertainty. \"The government did indicate back in 2014 its intention to do this, but didn\\'t include provisions in legislation, leading to uncertainty over whether the change was still planned,\" he said.  \"This latest announcement confirms the change will happen . . . and will be particularly impactful on those who were due to reach their 55th birthday just after the cut-off.\"  Experts said the move would probably affect those born after April 6, 1973, who are aged 47 and younger today. They will have to wait an extra two years to take either a lump sum or income from their pension.\\xa0  According to the Office for National Statistics, around 860,000 people were 46 years old in the UK in 2019, and are due to turn 55 in 2028.  David Hearne, a chartered financial planner with Satis Wealth Management, said the move would probably result in individuals having to revisit financial plans.  \"Those with a significant part of their assets in pensions are often waiting for 55 to achieve other plans such as repaying a mortgage, so increasing to 57 may mean two more years of interest payments,\" said Mr Hearne.\\xa0  \"It may also delay others helping their children with university or first house purchases.\"  Savers can access private pensions before the minimum access age but those who do risk a steep 55 per cent tax penalty on what they draw.',\n",
       " 'News Super backflip fear fuels EBA trade-off: unions Unions say fears the government might backflip on legislated superannuation rises are the reason some enterprise agreements promise workers bigger pay rises if there are no increases to super contributions.  The existing workplace deals have fuelled debate about whether superannuation rises will be at the expense of wage growth as the Morrison government faces pressure from backbenchers to scrap or delay an increase in compulsory employer super payments, which are scheduled to rise incrementally to 12 per cent of wages by 2025.  The Australian Council of Trade Unions and Labor have argued superannuation rises are not to blame for low wage growth and say increases help provide an adequate retirement.  But the clauses in some agreements show there can be a trade-off between wages and superannuation. Deals in 2020 with the paper, packaging and recycling giant Visy, the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Workers Union give workers a 1.5 per cent pay rise in 2021 if there is a 0.5 per cent bump in superannuation. If that does not go ahead, workers add the 0.5 per cent to their pay.  A 2017 enterprise agreement for journalists at the Australian Associated Press also included a clause giving journalists a pay rise in line with inflation, minus any increase in compulsory super.  Australian Council of Trade Unions president Michele O\\'Neil said the clauses were rare and most workers would be worse off if the super guarantee increase did not happen. \"Unions have struck these agreements because the government\\'s threat to working people\\'s legislated superannuation increase is not new,\" she said. \"These clauses are evidence of workers\\' lack of confidence in the government keeping to its promises when it comes to workers\\' rights.\"  Union sources said government data showed only nine of 5285 agreements signed in 2019 had a clause that modified agreements to fund superannuation increases.  Transport Workers Union national secretary Michael Kaine denied workers lost wage growth with higher superannuation, pointing to other agreements where the TWU had bargained for higher super and wage rises. Mr Kaine said low wage growth was a product of federal government policy.  James Pawluk, a superannuation expert at the McKell Institute, a Labor-aligned think tank, said he understood why a union would try to ensure workers still got a wage rise if there was no increase in superannuation. \"The only thing you can say with certainty is that if we don\\'t proceed with the superannuation guarantee increase there will be a lower share of income for the low paid.\"  Grattan Institute household finances program director Brendan Coates said enterprise agreements made it \"clear there is a trade-off between super and wages locked into the EBA\".  The Grattan research and the Reserve Bank were cited by Assistant Minister for Superannuation Senator Jane Hume this week as contributing to her view a higher super guarantee was given at the expense of wage growth.

       " 'News Mortgages trap for older homeowners EIGHT in 10 retired homeowners are being frozen out of getting a mortgage. The crisis is laid bare by research showing how the majority of retirees cannot access a mortgage of any kind that meets their needs. Experts said retirees are being \"sabotaged\" by rules that are not fair. Figures show 82 per cent of over-55s are unable to obtain a traditional, retirement or lifetime mortgage when they make an application. A major cause of the growing problem is stringent affordability criteria that penalise people who have taken advantage of the 2015 pension freedoms which allow them to \"drawdown\" from their pension pots. This income is disregarded by lenders, who rely solely on the lower guaranteed income of any surviving spouse. The rules could affect millions of over-55s. The analysis from retirement mortgage specialist Responsible Life exposes the mortgage trap awaiting many older owners who often want to stay in their home but do not have enough income to cover repayments.   Others, due to their age, are deemed to be borrowing too much in later life, stretching their loan-tovalue beyond levels that lenders allow. According to the data, it means that more than four fifths of applicants in the age group will find themselves disappointed. Responsible Life executive chairman Steve Wilkie said: \"Retirees are being frozen out of the mortgage market because they are being sabotaged by affordability rules that are not fit for purpose. Retired borrowers should be allowed to show a greater variety of repayment strategies to unlock lending. \"These should include plans to downsize, pension drawdown and reverting to lifetime mortgage products at the end of a mortgage term. \"Such flexibility would be in the spirit of other financial innovations that have sought to make it easier for the over-55s to navigate retirement, namely pensions freedoms.\" The findings stem from analysis of data collected by the Retirement Mortgage Service. As only the guaranteed income of a surviving spouse can be taken into account for retirement interest-only affordability tests, many retirees are attempting to borrow at ratios of more than 10 times their guaranteed income. This suggests lenders are confused about how affordability in the market works, the report said. Similar challenges are posed by lifetime mortgages. As they come with the ability to defer the interest, they offer lower loan-to-value ratios, so many older owners cannot access as much finance as they expect. Ray Boulger, mortgage expert at brokers John Charcol, said: \"Many over-55s will have an option that they might not be aware of. \"If you have enough equity to qualify for a mortgage, you don\\'t have to prove affordability - and the amount you can borrow increases with age.With lifetime mortgages you don\\'t have to prove income and have the option to pay nothing, pay interest or pay something extra.\" OPINION: PAGE 12  \\'The retired are frozen out of the market, sabotaged by rules that are not fit for purpose\\'',\n",

       " 'Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis extends a limited eviction, foreclosure suspension Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis again extended the statewide freeze on evictions and foreclosures, though not for all cases.  DeSantis on July 29 signed an executive order to extend the moratorium until 12:01 a.m. Sept. 1. If it had not been extended, the measure would have expired 12:01 a.m. Aug.1. The order has been extended several times since originally being signed by DeSantis in April.  But this executive order differs from previous orders since it specifies that final actions in eviction or foreclosure proceedings are paused only when the tenant or homeowner has been \"adversely affected\" by the coronavirus pandemic.  Someone is \"adversely affected\" by the pandemic if he or she endures \"loss of employment, diminished wages or business income or other monetary losses realized during the Florida State of Emergency\" that impacts the ability to make rent or mortgage payments, according to the executive order.  As a result, landlords and banks are prohibited from taking eviction and foreclosure actions against delinquent renters and homeowners impacted by the pandemic until July 1. But the order doesn\\'t excuse renters and homeowners of their obligation to pay rent or make mortgage payments.  The wording of the original executive order was less specific. It called for the suspension of evictions as a result of Covid-19, but did not mentioned the virus in the section on foreclosure suspension. Also, it did not define what it means to be affected by the pandemic.  Many eviction and foreclosure proceedings initiated before the pandemic hit were put on hold due to the executive order, Deborah Moskowitz, an Orlando-based attorney with Quintairos, Prieto, Wood & Boyer PA, previously told Orlando Business Journal. That contributes to a backlog of cases in the local court system, she said.  \"I don\\'t think any of these circumstances would\\'ve changed [due to the pandemic],\" she said. \"Those should be allowed to proceed.\"  The order is important because Central Florida\\'s economy continues to feel the effects of the coronavirus pandemic, which shuttered businesses and led to mass furloughs and layoffs.  For example, unemployment for metro Orlando was at 16.5% in June, the most recent data available from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity, while Florida\\'s rate was 10.7%.  Orange County\\'s Legal Aid Society has seen a surge in requests for assistance related to housing, with monthly housing inquiries nearly doubling from pre-pandemic to now, Executive Director Bethanie Barber previously told OBJ. It\\'s projected there may be 6,000 evictions in Orange County in the first month after the moratorium expires, Barber said.  \"We\\'re heading to a very dangerous place if a number of things don\\'t fall into alignment very quickly.\"  Sign up here for our free morning and afternoon daily newsletters.

       " 'Money Majority of UK employers have had to cancel work experience due to Covid-19 Three fifths (61%) say they have had to scrap some or all placements for students and graduates, according to pollCoronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage  UK students hoping to enter the jobs market have had work experience placements postponed, interviews cancelled and job offers withdrawn as businesses struggle in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, a new survey has revealed.  Three fifths of employers (61%) say they have had to cancel some or all of their work experience placements, with many warning they will be hiring fewer or no graduates  in the next year.  A YouGov poll for the Sutton Trust social mobility charity found that small- and medium-sized businesses in Britain were the most likely to be turning away graduates, with almost half (49%) cancelling all internships and work experience placements, compared to just under a third (29%) of bigger employers.  Almost two in five (39%) graduate employers said they expected to hire fewer graduates or none at all in the next 12 months, according to the poll of 1,000 British businesses, and just under half (48%) said there are likely to be fewer work experience opportunities in their businesses.  The findings confirm graduate fears about the impact of Covid on their immediate career prospects. A companion YouthSight poll of 900 students, also for the Sutton Trust, found that almost half (46%) of current undergraduates believe the pandemic has had a negative effect on their chances of finding a job.  Just under a fifth (18%) of students surveyed said that they had had work-experience placements cancelled or postponed, while more than one in 10 (11%) have had interviews cancelled and 4% have had a job offer withdrawn.  With fewer job opportunities available in the aftermath of lockdown, the Sutton Trust says promoting social mobility and fair access must remain priorities for employers  Sir Peter Lampl, the founder and chairman of the Sutton Trust, said: \"It is crystal clear that young people will bear the brunt for years to come of the massive downturn caused by Covid-19 and young people from poorer backgrounds will be most affected.  \"Employers will need policies in place to allow everyone a fair chance of being recruited to the lower number of graduate jobs available. As internships and work-experience placements are declining, employers need to move their programmes online. We need to act now to make sure that all young people have opportunities to enter the labour market.\"  Labour\\'s shadow minister for young people, Cat Smith, said the government had been too slow to act on youth unemployment. \"This report demonstrates that there is a clear gap between what the government has promised, and the availability of work experience placements being offered by employers.  \"The government must drop its one-size-fits-all approach to youth unemployment and work with local authorities to encourage businesses to take on and train young people.\"',\n",
       " \"SEC Charges Financial Advisor with Fraud for Stealing Millions from Investors Release date - 20072020  The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged former registered representative and investment adviser Michael Barry Carter with fraud for stealing from brokerage customers and an elderly advisory client.  The SEC's complaint alleges that Carter, a financial advisor in the McLean, Virginia office of a large financial institution, falsified internal documents in order to effect dozens of unauthorized wire transfers, totaling millions of dollars, from the accounts of brokerage customers to his personal bank account. According to the complaint, to generate some of the funds that he misappropriated, Carter sold securities without customer authorization. As alleged, Carter employed various methods to conceal his misconduct from his brokerage customers, including diverting account statements to addresses he controlled. The complaint further alleges that Carter made almost $1.5 million in unauthorized transfers from the accounts of an elderly advisory client, sending nearly $1 million to himself, and using some of the remainder to repay funds he had taken from a brokerage customer. Carter also allegedly misappropriated funds from the client that originated from 529-plan college savings accounts held at another financial institution for the benefit of the her grandchildren. The complaint alleges that Carter used the funds he misappropriated from his customers and client to support his lavish lifestyle.  'As a financial advisor, Carter was entrusted with millions of dollars belonging to his brokerage customers, his advisory clients, and their families,' said Marc P. Berger, Director of the SEC's New York Regional Office. 'As alleged in our complaint, Carter instead took advantage of that trust for his personal gain.'  The SEC's complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, charges Carter with violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The SEC is seeking injunctive relief, the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest, and a civil penalty.  In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland today announced criminal charges against Carter. Carter has pled guilty to those charges.

The gap allows regulated firms to offer risky, unregulated deals that are typically inappropriate for most people.  The quirk in the regulation came into the spotlight following the high-profile collapse in 2019 of London Capital & Finance, a regulated firm that had sold unregulated \"mini-bond\" investments worth £236m to around 12,000 investors. Savers have only had a small fraction of their money returned so far via compensation payouts.  The Treasury said the current system, which only requires an unregulated firm to be granted approval from an authorised provider before promoting high-risk bets, was no longer a \"sufficient safeguard\".  City Minister John Glen said: \"It\\'s important that people can understand the financial products they see promoted. If adverts by unauthorised firms are misleading, or don\\'t fully outline the risks, then people can end up losing money.\"  Newly proposed rule changes would force firms to obtain specific consent from the regulator before working with unauthorised entities.  The regime change would also tighten the screws on the promotion of digital currencies and crypto assets such as Bitcoin, which have boomed in popularity in recent years and are often promoted via social media.  Around 2.6 million people have now purchased some form of crypto asset, according to FCA research. More than a third who did so said they were encouraged to via an advert, with 83pc of buyers making purchases via exchanges based outside of Britain.  Laura Suter of investment firm AJ Bell said the FCA would have its job cut out policing the \"wild west of the crypto market\", which she said was populated by scammers and fraudsters as well as legitimate businesses.  \"With so much of the advertising and false claims made online, on social media and directly to retail investors, weeding out the rogues in the market is a job of gargantuan proportions,\" she said.  The regulator has been working with the Government and the Bank of England to understand and address the harms associated with crypto assets, which are known to be highly volatile and high risk, although it declined to comment on the changes the Government has proposed.',\n",
       " 'Money,Shopping,B&Q MOW ON B&Q has slashed its cordless lawnmower from £78 to £25 - and it comes with extra blades DIY store B&Q has cut the price of a compact lawnmower to just £25.  The Mac Allister Compact Cordless 18V Lawnmower, which has been reduced from £78, is part of a clearance sale the store is having.  Thanks to the bargain deal, shoppers can save £53 with the new price.  The mower\\'s been designed in a compact and cordless style, meaning all you have to do is charge it up before using it.  It also has an adjustable handle, so different people can use it easily and so it can be stored away simply.  The battery runs for 1.5 hours when it\\'s fully charged, giving you plenty of time to trim your grass in your garden.  B&Q\\'s deal is available in store and also online.  If you\\'re buying it online, remember that you\\'ll have to pay a minimum of £5 for delivery if your order is under £50.  Or, use the store locator tool to find your nearest branch.  The reduced lawnmower was spotted by one shopper, who posted it in the Extreme Couponing and Bargains UK group.  She wrote: \"Bargain in B&Q today. Cordless lawnmower down from £78 to £25. Forgot to mention, you get extra blades with it as well.\"  One B&Q fan said he was delighted with his purchase and commented on the post: \"I got one in Aintree yesterday. Comes with the charger and a battery that can be used in other Mac tools like a strimmer.\"  Another added: \"I got one this morning. Did a really good job, lasted over 15 mins (how long it took to do it) and not fully charged. Three height settings. Battery and charger included.\"  One shopper said it was a \"brilliant little mower\", adding: \"I collected mine this morning, fully charged battery and managed to cut both my front and back garden before battery died.  \"On full charge it lasted about 25-30 mins. I\\'m so happy with my bargain - thank you for posting this.\"  We also found the mower had been reduced on trade website Tradepoint.co.uk to £20.83.  But that price is excluding VAT, meaning if you opt to have it delivered (£4), you\\'ll end up paying nearly £5 in VAT.  This means the total price is £29.80 - only 20p cheaper than B&Q\\'s delivery.  Other cordless lawnmowers could cost you hundreds of pounds more.  Argos\\' are on sale from £100 while Homebase\\'s start from £70.  We\\'ve also created a list of where to buy the cheapest lawn mowers including cylinder, rotary and hover machines.

       " 'News Over-75s are urged to sign up for benefit EXCLUSIVE  MORE than a million of the UK\\'s poorest old folk are not claiming the Pension Credit benefit to which they are entitled, finance expert Martin Lewis has warned. Many elderly people do not even know they are entitled to the tax-free money, worth an average of £3,000 a year, and oldest pensioners stand to lose the most. From this August 1, up to 1.5 million pensioners over 75 could lose their free BBC TV licence if they do not receive the welfare benefit. Yet 590,000 of them are \"entitled nonrecipients\", latest figures from the Department ofWork and Pensions reveal. Mr Lewis, founder of MONEYSAVINGEXPERT.com, speaking exclusively to the Daily Express, said: \"Pension credit is disgracefully underclaimed, which is why I am somewhat nervous at the BBC linking the TV licence to it. \"The best thing to do is see it as an opportunity to shout about it. There are 1.2 million people eligible for this gateway benefit who aren\\'t claiming it. \"Not only is it worth possibly thousands of pounds and will entitle those over 75 to a free TV licence - it acts as a gateway for eligibility for many other discounts. Those include housing benefit, heating bills, free dental care, eye care vouchers and more. \"I\\'d urge anyone over 65 on a lower income to either use the government\\'s online pension credit calculator, or just call the hotline to see if you\\'re eligible.\" The Pension Credit (PC) is paid to people aged over state pension age and living on less than £173.75 a week as a sin- gle person, or £265.20 a week as a couple. This includes pensions, savings and salaries. Additionally, there are deals on offer from companies to customers on pension credit. For example, the BT Basic phone service charges just £5.10 a month for line rental, including a £1.50 call allowance. For BT Basic-plus Broadband it\\'s just £9.95.month. More than three million households are eligible for pension credit, but 1.2 million fail to claim the benefit, according to the DWP. Around 900,000 pensioners aged 75-plus claim the support but, if everyone claimed it who was entitled to it, the figure would rise to 1.5 million. The axing of the free TV licence for up to 3.7 million people is set to save the BBC £745million a year. The scheme was funded by the Government since 2000 then responsibility for the provision was passed to the BBC as part of its last licence fee settlement in 2015. The Department forWork and Pensions launched an awareness campaign earlier this year encouraging people to claim pension credit, which is not automatically given. You can apply via Gov.UK if you\\'ve already claimed your state pension, or phone the Pension Service on 0800 99 1234 or the NI Pension Centre on 0808 100 6165.',\n",
       " 'Education UK universities: no automatic tuition fee refunds, MPs say Petitions committee concludes there should not be a universal reimbursement for coronavirus disruption Coronavirus - latest updatesSee all our coronavirus coverage  Students at British universities should not expect automatic tuition fee refunds for disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak, according to MPs, despite complaints from thousands of those affected.  The MPs on parliament\\'s petitions committee said while many students had lost out as a result of campus closures and the switch to remote learning, at least some universities had made \"enormous efforts\" to provide effective teaching.  In a report, the committee concluded: \"While students do have a right to seek a refund or to repeat part of their course if the service provided by their university is substandard, we do not believe that there should be a universal refund or reimbursement of tuition fees to all university students.\"  The National Union of Students has said UK universities should offer the chance to repeat the year at no extra cost, or reimburse students\\' debts and costs.  The committee heard evidence from students and policymakers after a petition to reimburse all students for this year\\'s fees gained more than 300,000 signatures. The report will be forwarded to the government and requires a response within two months.  Catherine McKinnell, the Labour MP who chairs the petitions committee, said: \"Despite the hard work of lecturers and support staff, some universities have been unable to provide courses in a way that students feel is good value for money. Therefore, while we do not consider that a blanket refund for all students is necessarily required, we believe that the government has a role in ensuring any student whose university experience has fallen short is compensated.\"  The report calls for refund procedures to be streamlined and better publicised, saying the existing complaints process or use of the courts places too much of a burden on individual students and are likely to be overwhelmed by a flood of cases.  The MPs also said the government should pay for tuition fee refunds this year, \"given the importance of the higher education sector to the UK economy, and the exceptional circumstances\".  The committee\\'s research found just 7% of students were satisfied with the quality of education received this year, while 87% said their teaching hours had decreased since March. About 47% said they had paid for accommodation they didn\\'t need.  The committee heard from one student who said that after lectures were cancelled, \"half my lecturers just stuck up last year\\'s recordings\". Another said: \"We lost all of our international courses, events, networking opportunities, and even access to university facilities, like the library and data terminals.\"  Another student told the MPs: \"Most private schools have given a tuition fee decrease for the final term, which students will not be attending. If a private school can do that, when they are practically reliant on those funds, I feel that universities should be able to as well.\"',\n",

       " 'Lifestyle,Money BBC to scrap free TV licence for over-75s from August 1 Millions of pensioners will now have to pay £157.50 a year  The BBC\\'s free TV licencefor over-75s will be means-tested from August 1 after the date was delayed from June 1.  Under the plans, more than three million households will now have to pay the£157.50 annual fee.  The broadcaster previously postponed the axing of the universal entitlement for pensioners because of thecoronavirus pandemic.  BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said: \"The decision to commence the new scheme in August has not been easy, but implementation of the new scheme will beCovid-19safe.  \"The BBC could not continue delaying the scheme without impacting on programmes and services.  \"Around 1.5 million households could get free TV licences if someone is over 75 and receivesPension Credit, and 450,000 of them have already applied.  \"And critically, it is not the BBC making that judgment about poverty. It is the Government who sets and controls that measure.  \"Like most organisations, the BBC is under severe financial pressure due to the pandemic, yet we have continued to put the public first in all our decisions.  \"I believe continuing to fund some free TV licences is the fairest decision for the public, as we will be supporting the poorest, oldest pensioners without impacting the programmes and services that all audiences love.\"  Lockdown easing in Scotland: Stay in the know with our newsletters  TV Licensing email scams on the rise during lockdown - how to easily spot and report them  Charities including Age UK have urged the BBC to scrap the decision to end the universal benefit, saying that pensioners relied on theirfree TV licencemore than ever, as their main source of news and information about Covid-19 in lockdown.  Thefree TV licencewas introduced in 2000, but the BBC agreed to take on responsibility for funding the scheme as part of the charter agreement hammered out with the UK Government in 2015.  The broadcaster, which faces increased competition from streaming giants, has said it cannot afford to take on the financial burden from the UK Government.  Continuing with the Government scheme would have cost the corporation £745 million, the BBC said, meaning the closures of BBC Two, BBC Four, the BBC News Channel, the BBC Scotland channel, Radio 5 Live, and a number of local radio stations, as well as other cuts and reductions.  But the move provoked a swathe of criticism, with the likes of Dame Helen Mirren calling the end of the universal entitlement \"heartbreaking\", and former prime minister Gordon Brown saying \"costs should be covered by the Government\".  The decision comes as the Government is set to announce its response to a consultation on decriminalising licence fee evasion.  The Government launched an eight-week consultation in February which received more than 100,00 responses.  A report in May suggested that hundreds of people had opted to cancel theirTV licenceeach day over the past five maonths.  Coronavirus widget',\n",

And\\xa0will be able to save half the cost of their food if they go out to eat between Monday and Wednesday from the Government.

The Treasury said the temporary VAT cut will apply to \"supplies of food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, pubs, bars, cafés and similar premises across the UK\" - meaning booze is excluded.  The measures were welcomed by the Food and Drink Foundation, but it called for the option of extending the furlough scheme for the hostility industry to be kept on the table.

       " 'News Workers facing a lifetime of playing pension catch-up WORKERS in sectors including retail, travel and hospitality could face a lifetime of \"playing catch-up\" with their retirement savings, an insurer has warned.  Scottish Widows said many workers who are now taking a hit to their finances were already finding it difficult to save adequately for retirement before the coronavirus pandemic struck.  They could now struggle with ever being able to afford to retire.  Some are in sectors where businesses are feeling severe economic impacts from Covid-19, including the prospect of widespread job losses.  Scottish Widows\\' annual retirement report, looking at more than 5,000 adults across the UK, found that: ¦ More than a quarter (27%) of people working in travel and the arts have not yet started saving into a pension; ¦ Two-thirds (67%) of retail workers are worried that if they ever did retire, they would quickly run out of money; ¦ Nearly two-thirds (62%) of construction workers feel they are not preparing adequately for retirement; and ¦ Less than a fifth (18%) of restaurant workers are optimistic about their retirement.  It is highly likely that these workers are now also facing new financial pressures that will make saving for the long term even more difficult, Scottish Widows said.  It said one reason workers have historically been pessimistic about retirement, even before Covid-19, is employers who only contribute the legal minimum amounts into their pension.  Pete Glancy, head of policy at Scottish Widows, said that while around three in five people generally are estimated to be saving adequately for their retirement, \"long-term prospects are still to a large degree defined by the industry in which people work\".  \"That\\'s because while auto-enrolment has transformed the retirement prospects of millions, minimum contributions are still far below what is needed to provide a good standard of living,\" he said.  \"We recognise that the next 12-18 months is going to be about businesses getting back on their feet, but many individuals have taken a substantial hit to their finances and the fear is that the gap can\\'t be closed, meaning they face a lifetime of work as they struggle to afford to retire.\"  Scottish Widows also said hardworking \"multi-jobbers\" risk being left behind.  For example, a quarter (24%) of people in travel and tourism and in the arts have more than one job. This rises to 27% of people who work in education, the report said.  In total there are around 6.8 million \"multi-jobbers\" in the UK, Scottish Widows said.  Its report warned they could miss out on pension contributions because their income is split across different employers, so they could fall short of the minimum earnings threshold for automatic enrolment for each of those jobs.  Mr Glancy added: \"The pension system unfairly penalises those who are in low-paid work. Scrapping the minimum earnings threshold would allow millions of multi-jobbers to benefit from auto-enrolment like everyone else, and is long overdue.\"',\n",
       " 'MENENDEZ WARNS OF IMPENDING EVICTION, FORECLOSURE CRISIS DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC WASHINGTON, DC, July 1 -- The office of Sen. Bob Menendez issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate\\'s housing subcommittee, today spoke on the Senate floor to warn his colleagues of a looming foreclosure and eviction crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout if Congress fails to act.  \"[A]n impending storm ... is brewing and headed our way. It will bring with it enormous financial pain. It will threaten public safety. It will make fighting the pandemic that much harder. And it will set back our nation\\'s economic recovery,\" said Sen. Menendez. \"If the Senate fails to respond to this looming crisis, Americans will needlessly suffer, families will be displaced, personal fortunes will be wiped out, and the scars will run so deep, it could take decades to heal the wounds.\"  Sen. Menendez urged his colleagues to pass four separate pieces of legislation aimed at stabilizing the housing market and ensuring residents can remain safe and secure in their homes.  This week, he introduced the Coronavirus Housing Counseling Improvement Act (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/search?q=housing+counseling&access=p&as_dt=i&as_epq=&as_eq=&as_lq=&as_occt=any&as_oq=&as_q=&as_sitesearch=&client=wyden&sntsp=0&filter=0&getfields=&lr=&num=15&numgm=3&oe=UTF8&output=xml_no_dtd&partialfields=&proxycustom=&proxyreload=0&proxystylesheet=default_frontend&requiredfields=&sitesearch=&sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&start=0&ud=1) to expand access to critical information, assistance programs and services for millions of families struggling to remain in their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout. According to research, homeowners who receive counseling have a better chance at avoiding default, protecting their credit scores, reducing debt and securing mortgage modifications.  Sen. Menendez announced that he will introduce a separate bill, the Emergency Housing Assistance for Older Adults Act, which would provide $1.2 billion for two key HUD housing assistance programs in order to ensure that federally-assisted senior housing facilities have the necessary resources to effectively protect residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The senator has cosponsored the Housing Assistance Fund (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-will-introduce-bill-to-create-new-75b-housing-assistance-fund-to-keep-nj-families-in-their-homes) to provide $75 billion in targeted assistance to keep people in their homes while they search for new employment or wait to get back to work by helping residents pay the mortgage, utilities, and support to prevent eviction, delinquency or foreclosure. He is also an original cosponsor of the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, which would provide $100 billion to help families pay rent and help property owners maintain safe and healthy housing.

       " 'Money What cinemas will look like after lockdown -with special areas for social bubbles One of the UK\\'s biggest cinema chains said it plans to reopen in July as Britain\\'s entertainment sector gets back on track following months of lockdown  Cineworld is preparing to reopen all branches in England on July 10 with a new digital bookings system that will involve visitors checking in before attending viewings in person.  The chain, which was forced to close all 128 outlets on March 18, said it will be back in business next month, with the Government\\'s new safety gudielines in place.  New measures will include \\'updated seating maps\\' to space viewers out while all customers will have to book and confirm via a virtual bookings system.  In a statement, the world\\'s second largest cinema group explained: \"We are excited to announce that we are planning to reopen Cineworld Cinemas across England on 10th July 2020.  \"The opening date is subject to final clarifications and confirmation in regards to UK government restrictions, with dates to follow for our cinemas in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.\"  It comes as the lockdown was eased on Monday, allowing non-essential shops to open in England.  Under latest guidelines, drive-in cinemas can now reopen -though the Government has warned that indoor cinemas should not open until July 4 at the earliest.  Cineworld, which has 787 outlets globally, said there will be social distancing when stores reopen, with hand washing stations located throughout branches.  Tickets will be booked in advance on the company website or app -and confirmation emails will be sent in advance of bookings.  New seating maps will also be in place to \"allow friends and family to sit together while ensuring a safe distance between customers from different households\".  But the measures will vary based on the capacity and layout of each screen.  Film start and end times will be staggered to reduce customer interaction, while plastic screens will be placed at the till and PPE will be provided to employees, the company added.  Chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: \"We are thrilled to be back and encouraged by recent surveys that show that many people have missed going to the movie theatre.  \"With a strong slate confirmed for the coming weeks, including among others Tenet, Mulan, A Quiet Place Part II, Wonder Women 1984, Black Widow, Bond, Soul, Top Gun Maverick and many more, the entire Cineworld team remains committed to being \"the best place to watch a movie\".\"  The company was unable to comment on how the lockdown will affect those on its £238 a year unlimited membership plan.  Major chains, including Odeon, Cineworld and Picturehouse, as well as BFI Southbank, the screening complex operated by the British Film Institute, announced they were closing their doors with immediate effect in March as the lockdown came into effect,  Vue, another of the UK\\'s biggest cinema chains, has said it will reopen on July 4 if given the green light from ministers.',\n",

       " 'Local News The crucial detail Martin Lewis says is missing from UK furlough scheme The money saving expert has given his take on the announcement today by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak  The government announced today that the furlough scheme is to be extended until October.  Earlier Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the scheme will continue to pay a percentage or workers wages for another four months.  However, from August, employers will be asked to \\'start sharing\\' the cost.  Now Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has given his take on the announcement, reports the Manchester Evening News.  In a video posted on Twitter, he said: \"The Chancellor has just stood up in Parliament and announced an extension of the furlough scheme until October.  \"The first thing is that the scheme is being extended until July -exactly as it is now -80% up to £2,500, exactly the same eligibility.  \"So that\\'s really the initial three month scheme that was extended to June and now goes on until July in the same way.  \"After July the intention is to put some flexibility in the scheme, to allow people to start working while they\\'re on furlough.  \"The current rules are you can\\'t work for your existing employer while on furlough, you can work for another employer, although you\\'ll need your existing employer\\'s permission -depending on your contract -to do so.  \"After that point -from August to September and October -what we\\'ll have is you will be able to work for your employer, but your employer will be asked to share the cost.\"  Martin has said, though, that people will be no worse-off if they work part-time.  \"Even if your employer\\'s sharing the cost, you\\'re still going to get a minimum 80% of pay while on furlough,\" he said.  There are still some things up in the air, though, as Martin explained.  \"What we don\\'t know yet is whether, once we get to that August period where part time work will be allowed, will be whether it will have to be, whether the only furlough will be a part time scheme.  \"I can\\'t see that working, because there will still be some sectors of society that probably aren\\'t opened up yet.\"  Martin also noticed a big gap in the announcement.  He said: \"Also, conspicuous by its absence, is any mention of the self-employment income support scheme, which is -of course -open from tomorrow. That only pays out for three months.  \"So we have a full five months of Government furlough, and only three months of self-employment at the moment.  \"And then you\\'ve got the extension period, when you\\'ll have that other -slightly changed -incarnation of Government furlough and still no news for the self-employed.  \"So there will still be some people who are fully Government furloughed.\"  He finished by saying: \"I would find it quite flabbergasting if there wasn\\'t some support for the self-employed to come.\"',\n",
       " 'Extra Alaska governor signs bill to enable creation of electric reliability council Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy signed a bill to enable utilities, independent power producers and consumer groups to establish statutorily enforcible reliability and transmission standards through an independent regional reliability council.  Signed into law April 29, Senate Bill 123 affirms the Regulatory Commission of Alaska\\'s authority to regulate a reliability organization and define the basic structure, responsibilities and authorities of that organization. The bill also empowers the commission to require preapproval of large generation and transmission projects undertaken by Alaska utilities as part of the interconnected network.  The effort to form a regional reliability organization was launched by a group of so-called \"Railbelt utilities,\" which get their name from the Alaska Railroad along which the state\\'s most populated municipalities developed.  The Alaska Power Association, which counts those utilities among its members, said the reliability council will coordinate integrated resource planning and ensure consistent interconnection protocols for utilities, independent power producers and other entities that want to use the grid. The association said the council will work with the commission to develop a cost-sharing methodology for assets that provide regional benefits.  Railbelt utilities Anchorage Municipal Light & Power Inc., Chugach Electric Association Inc., Golden Valley Electric Association Inc., Homer Electric Association Inc., Matanuska Electric Association Inc. and the City Of Seward\\'s electric utility signed an agreement in December 2019 pledging to form an independent regional reliability council and to work together on enforceable standards to improve Railbelt electric reliability and cybersecurity.  Sen. John Coghill, R-North Pole, who is chairman of the Special Senate Railbelt Electric System Committee that drafted and introduced the bill, said the council should be \"up and running\" by mid-2021.  \"On behalf of electric utility customers from Fairbanks to the Matanuska and Susitna valleys, from Anchorage through the Kenai Peninsula to Homer and Seward, S.B. 123 will foster cooperation among the interconnected utilities and ensure consumer needs are efficiently and reliably met,\" Coghill said in a press release.  Regulatory Commission Chairman Bob Pickett said legislative leaders, the commission, utilities, independent power producers and other public interest representatives contributed to the effort, which started in 2014.  Chugach Electric COO Brian Hickey said the formation of a reliability organization is important because Alaska\\'s grid is not linked with any other state or Canadian province, and the isolated system, therefore, cannot rely on other grids for support. Alaska\\'s electric system is small with few interconnections and generation facilities, so its spinning reserve requirements are much greater than those of the lower 48 states, he said.  Because it makes no interstate exchanges of electricity, Alaska\\'s power system is not subject to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission\\'s jurisdiction. Its existing voluntary reliability standards are loosely based on those established by the North American Electric Reliability Corp., Hickey said in a phone call.  More than 90% of Alaskans get electricity from either a cooperative or a municipal utility, according to the Alaska Power Association.',\n",

From a ban on children in store to social distancing in the aisles, here are the rules to follow during your food shop.  Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news & updates  Why have supermarkets introduced new rules during coronavirus lockdown?  Despite calls for customers to refrain from frequenting stores and panic-buying, long queues and short supplies have become the norm in the majority of supermarkets across the country.  This has forced them to implement new rules to ensure public safety and allow other customers a fair chance of grabbing supplies.  Packed stores make it difficult for staff and customers to adhere to the two-metres distance rule put in place to stop the coronavirus spreading.  Also, the constant flux of customers means that there is no time for workers to replenish stock for the next day, to combat this, stores have been shutting early to have enough time to prepare for the long days ahead.  Can I still take my kids to the supermarket?  It\\'s been reported that some stores have been refusing to let parents bring their kids in.  Furious customers have been voicing their anger and frustration over social media about these measures, calling out some of the big-name stores for its treatment of single mothers.  One shopper said: \"Asda are allowing one person only from each household. I just go10t turned away with my son.  \"Luckily I could leave him outside if I wanted as he\\'s old enough. Kinda concerned for the single parents with younger children and no family/support though.\"  Asda refuted these claims on its Twitter account saying: \"You may have seen posts being shared on social media suggesting that families with children won\\'t be allowed into our stores. This isn\\'t the case.\"  Aldi, Sainsbury\\'s and Tesco, all who have been accused of the same thing, have said they don\\'t have a ban on children in stores, with each supermarket saying parents are able to bring kids in if necessary.  But as most supermarkets are limiting the amount of people allowed in-store at one time, it seems that children can fall into that category.  https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/LB-SHOP-GRAPHICS-3.jpg  Which shopping items are supermarkets rationing?  Rationing has been introduced by supermarkets for the first-time since World War II, in an effort to prevent coronavirus stockpiling.  Limits have been put in place on how many of one item you can buy per person across all products in all supermarkets.  In most cases this seems to be three or four items of any particular product per person. Each store has different variations on the products its choosing to limit, but most have highlighted these:',\n",

       " '\\'Discriminated against\\': Disability pensioners fight for COVID-19 supplement Disability pensioners claim they have been discriminated against by the federal government in its response to the coronavirus pandemic, with one young Sydney man saying he is on the verge of homelessness.  A coalition of advocacy groups are demanding the government include people receiving the disability support pension on the fortnightly $550 COVID-19 supplement following the exclusion of disabled people and their carers, despite welfare recipients such as those on JobSeeker, Youth Allowance and Austudy being eligible.  Brendan Brest, 22, who lives with a mental health disability, said he worked his way up from a life on the streets to living in transitional housing, with a view to moving into private, shared accommodation.  He was also climbing the ranks with his job at an airline when the crisis struck, seeing him stood down and unable to move out.  \"I was on the verge of building myself up. I was looking at being stable. I was on the up hill and when all this turned up it just dropped,\" Mr Brest said.  After earning up to $1000 a fortnight with his pension and wage combined, he is now on half that after his community housing provider deducts the rent from the government payment.  Minus his living expenses, such as food, medication, internet and phone bill, Mr Brest said he wouldn\\'t have enough to catch the train to work if he still had a job.  \"The risk of going back to being homeless is there,\" he said.  Pam Barker, CEO of youth homelessness charity YFoundations, said a lot of people on the disability pension used employment to supplement their incomes.  She said there was an increase of young people sleeping rough, which was likely to continue with other factors such as rental stress and domestic violence.  An open letter penned by Disabled People\\'s Organisations Australia and endorsed by more than 70 organisations said the disability pension was inadequate support during the crisis.  A spokesperson for Families and Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said the pension was a long-term payment that was already paid at the highest rate of support in the system, \"significantly higher than the JobSeeker base rate - because recipients are not expected to work to support themselves.\"  The spokesperson added the disability pension, which can be up to $944 a fortnight for singles, would continue to be paid at a higher rate than JobSeeker, which was $565.70 fortnightly for singles.  Disability pension recipients would also be among those to receive two separate support payments in response to the crisis, the spokesperson said.  But disabled people who access the JobSeeker payment lose their eligibility for support.  Disability pensioner Kristin O\\'Connell, who is campaigning for the supplement on behalf of the Australian Unemployed Workers\\' Union, said the pension was well below liveable standards, while costs for household items were also going up due to supply issues.  \"We\\'re being discriminated against, it\\'s not treating people equally,\" she said.',\n",

Earlier this month, Airbus said it would cut the number of planes it builds by a third as travel restrictions dramatically reduce the demand for new aircraft.  A number of airlines, including EasyJet and British Airways, have grounded all or some of their fleet.  \"In just a couple of weeks we have lost roughly one-third of our business. And, frankly, that\\'s not even the worst case scenario we could face,\" Mr Faury said.  The company has about 13,500 staff in the UK, most of whom help make wings for planes at sites in Broughton, north Wales, and Filton, Bristol.  Airbus is scheduled to release its latest financial results on Wednesday, when commentators suggest it could also unveil job cuts.  The Sun has contacted Airbus for comment.  The coronavirus lockdown has proved difficult for businesses across the UK - last week, fashion store Animal said it would shut all 21 of its UK stores putting 500 jobs at risk.

       " 'LPL halts sales of some less liquid investments LPL Financial is shutting down sales of some investment products that contain less liquid and hard-to-price assets such as real estate.  After blocking sales of eight nontraded real estate investment trusts last Monday, the nation\\'s largest independent broker-dealer extended that policy to include several publicly traded property interval funds.  Limiting access to less liquid investments was described as a prudent strategy at a time when prices on assets such as real estate are likely to be affected by economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.  \"It makes sense, if you look at portfolios of interval funds, they will be nontraded REITs and institutional property funds that are all subject to the same risks related to these markets,\" said Jacob Mohs, manager of the Interval Fund Tracker website. \"It\\'s hard to rationally value those assets because there\\'s no activity in real estate right now.\"  LPL declined to provide details on the decision or the specific funds, but the company did confirm the decision in an emailed statement from Rob Pettman, executive vice president of products and platforms.  \"Due to the nature in which real estate is often valued, and out of an abundance of caution, LPL decided to temporarily suspend new purchases of certain products. These suspensions are not the result of any action taken by the product sponsor and instead are directly correlated to the market dislocation. LPL hopes to offer these products again soon as we gain a better understanding of the valuations of the underlying assets.\"  Mohs described LPL\\'s strategy as \"throwing up the caution flag and trying to avoid any future lawsuits by investors who might be overpaying\" for assets that are going to be difficult to price in the current market environment.  \"Many of the property funds are funds of funds, so there are several layers of uncertainty,\" he said. \"If you can\\'t value the commercial property, you can\\'t value the shares of the funds holding that commercial property. LPL\\'s decision is defensible and fair, because there\\'s going to be a wide divergence in how the underlying real estate performs.\"  Interval funds are required to repurchase shares at fixed intervals to provide liquidity to investors.  They\\'re a kind of closed-end fund and usually hold less liquid assets, which is why portfolio redemptions are typically limited to 5% of total fund assets per quarter, divided among the investors requesting redemptions.  While it makes sense for companies to restrict sales when the value of underlying assets might be difficult to price, interval funds are uniquely suited for a volatile and uncertain economic environment. The structure prevents investors from panic selling, which allows portfolio managers to avoid having to sell at fire-sale prices.  \"Right now, LPL is going to be extra cautious because brokers have had issues in the past with nontraded REITs,\" said Dick Pfister, founder and president of AlphaCore Capital.

       " \"State Digests Complete Forfeiture of Public Employment Pension Not Excessive Fine Where Triggered by Abuse of Authority of Public Position LABOR LAW  STATE V. ANDERSON  NO. A-4289-18T3  MAR. 30, 2020 (DATE DECIDED)  JUDGE NATALI JR.  FOR APPELLANT: Miller, Meyerson & Corbo (Nirmalan Nagulendran and Gerald D. Miller, on the briefs);  FOR RESPONDENT: Gurbir S. Grewal, Attorney General (Steven K. Cuttonaro, Deputy Attorney General, of counsel and on the brief)  Defendant appealed from the order of the trial court, which ordered defendant to forfeit his entire pension from his employment with the city of Jersey City. During his employment with Jersey City, defendant had come to work in the city's tax assessor's office; he had earned a pension that would have provided him with annual payments of more than $60,000. In his last position in the tax assessor's office, defendant had the authority to alter tax descriptions for property in the city without the property owner needing to file a formal application with the city zoning board.  A cooperating witness came forward to law enforcement to report that defendant had accepted a bribe of $300 from him to change the tax description on the witness's property. Defendant was charged with and ultimately pled guilty to one federal count of bribery. Following defendant's conviction, the city reduced his annual pension to approximately $48,000. However, the state filed the present complaint seeking forfeiture of defendant's entire pension and retirement benefits.  The state moved for summary judgment in the action. The trial court granted the motion, first noting that New Jersey law required the forfeiture of defendant's current position and banning defendant from all future public employment because he had been convicted of a federal crime involving dishonesty in defendant's public position. The trial court further ruled that defendant's conviction also required forfeiture of defendant's entire pension and retirement benefits because the federal offense of conviction was substantially similar to one of the enumerated state criminal offenses that required complete forfeiture of public pension benefits under New Jersey law. Although defendant argued that complete forfeiture of his pension benefits violated the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment, the trial court rejected that argument, ruling that pension benefits were a contractual arrangement, rather than a property right, such that forfeiting pension benefits did not constitute a penalty or fine.  On appeal, the court affirmed the judgment of the trial court. The court agreed with defendant that forfeiture of his pension benefits did constitute a fine that would trigger the effect of the Excessive Fines Clause because the contractual right to pension benefits did constitute a property interest. However, the court affirmed the complete forfeiture of defendant's pension, ruling that forfeiture of the entire pension was not a disproportionate or unconstitutional fine. The court noted that complete forfeiture was mandated by state law and held that it was proportionate in light of the fact that defendant had abused his authority and breached the public trust.\",\n",
       " 'UK News Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis issues advice for the self-employed as UK put on lockdown Martin Lewis has issued advice to the self-employed affected by the coronavirus outbreak  It is a worrying time for self-employed individuals.  Beauticians, hairdressers, child-minders and dog walkers are just some of the people who have been left worrying about their finances following the coronavirus outbreak.  Now, Martin Lewis  has issued advice to the self-employed affected by the changes, the Manchester Evening News reports.   In a video posted on social media, Martin  urged people not to panic and gave advice to those in need of financial support.  He said: \"I\\'m very aware of how difficult the scenario is right now if you\\'re self-employed.  \"You may have no income coming in and feel there is very limited support coming in from the state so I have two big messages for you.  \"I have it confirmed from the Government they are working on a support package for the self-employed.  \"They hope to make an announcement this week.\"  Martin said he doesn\\'t yet know what the support package will be, but thinks: \"One would assume they would be looking to put the self-employed in some sort of parity with employees receiving 80% of their salary.\"  Martin added that self-employed individuals who have money put aside for tax payments are allowed to defer their self-assessment payment by six months, which would free up some much-needed cash.  For those employed but on zero-hour contracts, the Money Saving Expert advised: \"It depends on the nature of your zero-hours contract, but if you are paid by PAYE it may well be possible to be furloughed.\"  Furloughing, Martin says, is the new system.  He explained: \"I want you to think of it, the best analogy is a bit like putting your TV on standby.  \"You switch it off, it\\'s not fully off, it waits there until you need it again and that\\'s what the Government is trying to do to the many employees who won\\'t, or can\\'t be able to work, so you could be put on standby.  The reasons you are allowed to go outside during lockdown  \"Now in order to do this, what it said is, companies will be able to claim up to 80% of your salary up to a maximum of £2,500 a month -if an employee is on furlough.  \"Now they\\'ve said, and we would all hope that the company will give them 100% of their salary, but, it doesn\\'t have to do that.  \"However, that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing because in some cases they would be getting rid of you or giving you unpaid leave anyway.  \"So, if your situation is the only way they\\'ll keep you on is to go on 80% of your salary -volunteer it. Hopefully, companies that are a bit more financially solid will give you more.\"',\n",

       " 'Money Saving Martin Lewis warns you have days to eliminate your bank overdraft He\\'s called the consequences of having an overdraft \\'transparently hideous\\'  Money-saving expert Martin Lewis has issued an urgent warning to anybody in their overdraft, as changes to interest rates are set to sky rocket at the end of the week.  Martin has pointed out that overdraft rates could soon be more expensive than credit cards, so it\\'s important to act as quickly as possible to minimise the impact of the changes.  \"Cut your overdraft NOW -it\\'s costlier than credit cards,\" Martin advised in his weekly MoneySavingExpert newsletter.   \"Overdrafts are the new danger debt -double the interest of high street credit cards.\"  He continued: \"The new rates are transparently hideous.\"  Martin went on to explain how there\\'s virtually no competition between banks to achieve the best rate, as almost every bank will now charge around 40 per cent.  Martin explained: \"Nationwide\\'s rate changed in Nov -this week HSBC, First Direct & M&S do it, and the rest will roll out imminently.\"  According to the MoneySavingExpert newsletter: \"The worst hit are those with large, authorised overdrafts of c.£600+, who could see costs double. Those who just occasionally dip into overdrafts, or only have small ones, will find this new system cheaper if they are used to having daily fees.  \"Those with unauthorised overdrafts ie, bust your limit will pay less, as banks can no longer charge more than they do for authorised overdrafts.\"  If you\\'re overdrawn you should look to minimise the rate to 0 per cent.  This won\\'t be possible for everyone, but will work for people with a decent credit rating.  For people with smaller overdrafts, Martin highlighted First Direct  -which offers people a £250 interest-free overdraft buffer and £100 in cash for moving to them.  The Martin Lewis\\' Coronavirus advice that could save you thousands  People with larger overdrafts could try Nationwide\\'s FlexDirect  , which offers people moving to it a 0% overdraft for a year -the limit depends on your credit score, but it can be large . After a year the rate shoots up to 39.9% though, so it\\'s a reprieve to let you pay down your debts rather than a permanent solution.  The cheapest overdraft rates outside that are from Starling  15% to 35% depending on credit score and Monzo  between 19% and 39% depending on credit score.  Other options include 0% money transfer cards -that will charge you a small fee normally less than 5% to borrow money for a fixed time.  This cash can then be used to clear your overdraft -although you\\'ll need to clear the balance on the cards before the 0% period ends or be hit with interest charges and, once again, if you\\'ll be accepted and how much you\\'ll get depends on your credit score.

       " \"Financial regulators to assist institutions affected by coronavirus Federal financial institution regulators and state regulators said March 9 they will provide appropriate regulatory assistance to financial institutions affected by the coronavirus and encouraged them to address the financial needs of customers and members who are also affected.  In a joint statement by the Federal Reserve Board, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Conference of State Bank Supervisors, financial institutions were told to work constructively with borrowers and other customers in affected communities through efforts that are consistent with safe and sound lending practices.  The statement follows a letter from Senate Democrats sent to the aforementioned regulators, plus the Federal Housing Finance Agency, urging them to issue guidance on forbearance due to impacts of the coronavirus, since affected consumers and businesses may have difficulty accessing affordable credit and face temporary hardship in paying credit obligations.  Such guidance should include efforts to modify terms on existing loans or extend new consumer-friendly access to credit, as well as steps to prevent the disclosure of adverse information on consumers affected by the virus to credit bureaus, which may be used in a manner that would harm them, the letter said.  The senators also sent a letter to the Consumer Bankers Association, Bank Policy Institute, American Bankers Association, Independent Community Bankers of America, Financial Services Forum, Credit Union National Association and National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions. Here, the senators asked for information on how member companies of the respective groups plan to make sure that employees affected by the coronavirus will not lose their jobs, be forced to deplete their sick and annual leave, have access to flexible scheduling options and have access to financial assistance in case of a sustained or widespread disruption due to the virus.  They also recommended that member companies consider waiving overdraft and monthly service fees for affected customers, suspending or modifying student loan, mortgage and business loan payments as necessary.  A separate letter signed by Sens. Mark Warner and Sherrod Brown was also sent to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, urging them to issue guidance to mortgage servicers to help borrowers navigate the financial effects of the coronavirus. This includes authorizing servicers to suspend or reduce a homeowner's mortgage payments immediately if they believe the homeowner's financial situation is affected by the virus, waiving late fees and suspending credit bureau reporting, foreclosures and other legal proceedings as necessary.  Additionally, Warner wrote to Equifax Inc., Experian North America and TransUnion asking them to work with lenders, data furnishers and consumers to ensure that adverse information arising due to the financial shock of the coronavirus will not be used in a way that would hurt consumers' creditworthiness. He also urged them to work with any company that furnishes consumer credit account data to provide updates on how they can work with consumers on coronavirus-related financial problems.\",\n",
       " 'Smart Investor PROPERTY IS JITTERY ? Top-end real estate deals are being pulled amid growing nervousness about the impact of the coronavirus on real estate markets, say buyers\\' agents in Melbourne and Sydney.  But whether the market jitters turn into the sort of panicked responses that are inciting consumers to strip supermarket shelves will depend on the length and severity of the outbreak and public perceptions about finding a cure, says Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy and chief economist for AMP Capital.  A fall in the number of cashed-up foreign buyers - and their representatives - at auctions is also creating more opportunities for locals, says Patrick Bright, a Sydney-based buyer\\'s agent.  About 1440 auctions are scheduled for this weekend, less than half those last weekend - largely because there are nearly 400 fewer in Melbourne, which has a long weekend.  Sales in recent weeks have been very strong with clearance rates of more than 70 per cent in Melbourne and Sydney, rising prices and the return of first-time buyers and upgraders.  Increasing supply of property, government incentives for new buyers, falling interest rates and special offers from lenders are expected to boost market sentiment and maintain momentum.  But Oliver says many buyers and sellers are pausing to take the market\\'s temperature as they work through a range of permutations caused by the coronavirus crisis.  Oliver says that in the worst case, the virus would cause the economy to slow, increasing unemployment, decreasing consumer demand and causing some house buyers to miss repayments - accelerating a slide into recession.  Alternatively, buyers could be buoyed by signs the virus is reaching its peak, or a vaccine has been found or that the virus begins to lose its grip as summer begins in the northern hemisphere.  Emma Bloom, a director of buyers\\' agent Morrell and Koren, says: \"Fears about the virus are already causing people to pull out of deals. Some are panicked and others do not know what to do. No one feels confident, there is a lot of nervousness\"  Bloom - who targets Melbourne\\'s Toorak, South Yarra and affluent south-eastern suburbs - says some vendors are giving instructions to take offers close to the asking price, rather than hold out for more, while buyers are not turning up for sales where they were expected to bid.  Rich Harvey, a Sydney-based buyers\\' agent, adds: \"There is a lot of fear and uncertainty ... some buyers and sellers are pulling out of deals.\"  Other agents say the worst cases would include buyers staying away from auctions because of fears about contracting the virus in a crowd and sellers replacing open house inspections with a limited number of individual buyer appointments.  Bright says the number of foreign buyers and their agents has declined since the recent Hong Kong troubles, which peaked in January.  \"Other agents are also saying they are not getting the same amount of interest,\" says Bright, who believes less competition could make it easier for locals to win deals.W',\n",
       " \"Money STOCK MARKET WATCHLIST: Will coronavirus take its toll on Ministers' NatWest sale? The Government could clearly do with some spare cash to help deal with the coronavirus crisis.  Luckily, there's a Budget this week and Alison Rose, the new chief executive of the renamed NatWest Group, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, will be watching more avidly than most.  That's because speculation has been mounting that the Government might finally start selling off the rest of its 62.4 per cent stake in the bank, which it bailed out in the wake of the financial crisis.  The bank has steadied the ship and has started paying dividends once again. And the organisation has been rebranded by Rose.  Last month, chairman Sir Howard Davies said he expected the Government to press ahead with selling more of its shares with 'enthusiasm and energy'.  But even if the Government agreed with him at the time, things are a little trickier now. Coronavirus has knocked the shares down by more than 30 per cent.  Many will be watching very closely on Wednesday to see whether Ministers still push the button on a sell-off despite the slump.  On Friday, Cineworld rushed to reassure investors about the impact coronavirus was having on visits to its cinemas.  The company said it had not seen any major drop-off in box office figures, which followed a downgrade from analysts who believe the delayed release of the new James Bond movie No Time To Die will be the first of many.  Cineworld also released its expected figures for 2019, ahead of the formal unveiling on Thursday.  But with companies in other sectors having lowered their financial forecasts due to the virus, investors will be more interested in scrutinising the guidance for 2020.  Away from the corona panic which is hammering markets, Tullow Oil is poised to unveil the results of its strategic review when it releases its annual results on Thursday.  The review was triggered after a series of setbacks for the oil firm which caused its shares to tank.  Rumours of a cut-price takeover by Total were quashed last month by the French company's chief executive.  But word reaches me that a private equity firm is circling Tullow, which is valued at £330million.  Its identity is unclear at the moment, but perhaps it will be revealed on Thursday.  Talking of the Budget, housebuilders will be keeping an eye on any new measures after enjoying a leg-up in recent years from Help To Buy.  The scheme is due to end in March 2023, though builders will still have plenty of cash washing around.  A stamp duty cut had been touted as a possible tool to help new Chancellor Rishi Sunak to keep the housing market bubbling along.

       " 'City fringe land sales bounce back Low interest rates and developer incentives are driving a turnaround in land sales in Melbourne\\'s fringe housing estates, but - fortunately for first-time buyers - prices aren\\'t keeping pace.  Midway through last year, land sales across Melbourne and Geelong\\'s new greenfield estates were at a three-year low.  Now they have bounced back with two consecutive quarters of growth, RPM Real Estate Group\\'s latest Residential Market Review shows.  Lot sales jumped 17 per cent in the December quarter. That figure was a rise on the previous September quarter, which itself was sharply up, 48 per cent, on the three months prior.  But the legacy of the downturn, a stockpile of developer lots and transactions abandoned by struggling buyers coming back onto the market, is keeping a lid on prices.  While Melbourne\\'s median price for established houses is peaking again - it hit $859,000 at the end of last year - land prices have headed in the other direction.  The median lot price fell by 2.1 per cent by the end of the year to $308,900, about 5 per cent less than what families and investors were paying 12 months before.  \"The key drivers underpinning a strengthening land market included improved buyer sentiment and activity from interest rate reductions and more borrowing power, ongoing price correction and continued incentives and rebates,\" RPM\\'s chief executive Kevin Brown said.  Sales of new land lots in the growth corridors have traditionally lagged behind established housing as house-and-land developers cater largely to struggling first-time buyers who are sensitive to both prices and job security.  The agency\\'s head of communities Luke Kelly said developers were still offering buyers incentives and rebates to shift a backlog of stock, a tactic likely to keep prices suppressed for the next six months.  \"There are still some secondary lots being sold on the market. Between now and September we\\'ll see some normality come back in the market,\" he predicted, with land sales expected to reach more ???normal\\' levels of about1400 lots a month.  The price of land sweetspot for first time buyers is below $300,000. \"That\\'s what people can afford based on their current incomes,\" he said.  Lot sales were strongest in the northern and south-east growth corridor where they rose between 16 and 17 per cent. Out in the west, a high volume of unsold land is impacting prices and sales volumes, RPM reports.  The pick up over the quarter was not reflected in the half-year results of the country\\'s largest land developer Stockland.  It said last week the slow housing market will hold its full-year earnings at 5 per cent, at the lower end of its guidance estimate.  Stockland\\'s chief executive Mark Steinert said he expected settlements to pick up in the second half after they had dropped substantially, by one-third to 2096, in the six months to December, down from 3159 a year earlier.',\n",

Developed by Haven Life Insurance Agency, AgeUp is designed to provide the adult children of the Boomer generation with financial protection for their parents once they reach an advanced age.  Millennials and Gen Xers across the majority of the country can now purchase AgeUp, a unique financial product that provides guaranteed payouts once a parent reaches the selected age and lasts for the rest of their lifetime. Built to be financially accessible to all, AgeUp does not require upfront payments or large monthly contributions. Instead, premiums are flexible, as purchasers can choose to pause, increase or decrease their payments at any time. AgeUp is exclusively available online, and buyers can sign up directly via the website.  As the Baby Boomer generation grows older, the gap between their retirement savings and longevity will increase exponentially -- and the financial burden is poised to fall squarely on the shoulders of their adult children. Recent data from AgeUp found that 68% of millennials and Gen Xers expect that they\\'ll financially support their parents should they outlive their retirement savings. However, the number of adult children who are acting on that belief is considerably smaller, with only 37% saying they have already accounted for their parents and in-laws in their own long-term financial planning. This is likely because discussing personal finances is widely considered taboo; 56% of millennials and Gen Xers surveyed said they \"never\" speak with their parents about their financial plans for retirement, or they speak about it \"rarely\" (once per year). The full findings on how millennials and Gen Xers are approaching their parents\\' longevity, retirement savings, and financial planning can be found here.  The AgeUp product is issued by MassMutual and was developed by MassMutual\\'s in-house startup, Haven Life Insurance Agency, out of their newly formed Boston Studio. In 2020, AgeUp will expand its offering to allow Baby Boomers to purchase the product for themselves.  About AgeUp  AgeUp is a new annuity product designed to help protect families from the financial risk of loved ones living into their 90s and beyond. AgeUp is sold by Haven Life Insurance Agency (Haven Life), which is backed and wholly owned by Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual).

       " 'money Now Granny is hit by the child benefit claims confusion Janet Tutton is one of thousands of women born in the 1950s who missed out financially because of the way the pension system was reformed.  Not only was she affected because of how the state pension age was equalised for men and women, she was also caught out by the sudden increase in the number of years of national insurance contributions needed to get a full state pension.  Janet also learnt that she had gaps in her national insurance record because she had opted out of the state second pension, meaning that she didn\\'t have the 35 years of credits needed to get a full state pension.  Janet, 66, looked for ways of recouping her credits and discovered that she could earn them through looking after her grandchildren Isaac, six, and Georgie, four, which she had already been doing for years.  You can apply for \"specified adult childcare credits\" if you are a family member caring for a child under the age of 12. It means that parents can donate the national insurance credits they would get from registering child benefit to a family member.  However, when she started filling in the application form to claim additional national insurance credits, she realised that another complicated system stood in her way: child benefit. She was not able to get the credits because the children\\'s parents had not registered to receive the benefit. Her daughter Nicola, 40, did not qualify for it because she is classed as a high earner. Like many parents, Nicola did not fill in the child benefit form because, under rules introduced in 2013, she was not eligible for any money.  \"She\\'s a very busy person in a high-pressure job, it\\'s just a lot of effort to get nothing back,\" Janet says.  Parents can claim £1,788 in child benefits each year for two children, but they have to start paying some of this back through tax if one of them earns more than £50,000 a year. If one of them earns £60,000 a year they get nothing. Two parents each earning £49,999, with a household income of almost £100,000, can get full benefits.  Janet\\'s case is another example of how families are being affected by the confusion around the child-benefit system. This is why  The Times  and  The Sunday Times  are calling for reform in the forthcoming budget.  \"Once upon a time, when everyone received child benefit regardless of income, this link between child-benefit and national-insurance entitlements made sense, but the current system is no longer fit for purpose, \" Becky O\\'Connor of the adviser and asset manager Royal London says.  HMRC says: \"We use a wide array of channels to reach those customers who may be liable to pay the high-income child-benefit charge. This includes putting information in packs made available to new parents which tell them how to claim child benefit.\"',\n",

A drawdown facility has not yet been offered. Vanguard said this would be added \\'in due course\\'.  Launch of the Sipp removes a barrier to Vanguard\\'s growth in the UK platform market. For investors who prefer passive funds, its service is keenly priced.  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">  What\\'s not to like about paying between nil to 0.15% pa to hold @Vanguard_UK funds in your pension compared to 0.45% pa with @HLInvest  - Jason Butler (@jbthewealthman) February 19, 2020</blockquote>  Platform rivals pointed to their wider investment choice in response to Vanguard\\'s launch.  Rebecca O\\'Keeffe, head of investment at Interactive Investor, said its average Sipp customer held 17% of their pension in shares, 37% in funds, 24% in investment trusts and 8% in ETFs.  She added that platforms with broader access to different investments, including active funds, were more suited to investors focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues.  \\'Yes, there is an opportunity to invest in ethical funds that avoid certain sectors, but many investors may want the opportunity to invest in ethical funds that embrace socially responsible or ethical options,\\' she said.  \\'For these investors, choice will be key and they are likely to want access to the whole of market.\\'  Launch of the Sipp is likely to spur investment in Vanguard\\'s Target Retirement funds, launched in 2015 but housing just £205m of assets and dwarfed by the fund group\\'s LifeStrategy fund range.  These funds invest in both shares and bonds, and increase the proportion held in less volatile fixed income as the targeted retirement date nears.  Ten funds are offered, with targeted retirement dates of between 2020 and 2065, rising in five-year increments.',\n",

       " 'News Ireland\\'s pension pot \\'lags behind overall economy\\' PENSIONS  The ratio of pension assets to GDP is well below what it is in other countries, writes Fearghal O\\'Connor  A KEY metric of pension assets in Ireland has failed to keep pace with growth in overall retirement funding levels in other countries, according to a new international report.  The ratio of pension savings to the size of the Irish economy lags well behind other developed economies, found the Thinking Ahead Institute\\'s Global Pension Assets Study.  Pension assets as a proportion of GDP in Ireland are estimated at 48pc, much lower than the 126pc ratio in the UK, which has a similar pensions landscape. That is just 4pc higher than where it was 10 years ago, according to the research arm of advisory firm Willis Towers Watson. Pensions have been pushed back on to the political agenda here by pre-election promises to reverse the raising of the pension age.  In 2019, Irish pension assets grew by 14.8pc to reach an estimated $184bn (?164bn), up from $103bn since 2009. But it showed that, despite this faster than average growth among the 22 countries surveyed, Irish pension assets are not keeping pace with the growth in the economy.  The ratio of pension assets to GDP went from 87pc to 126pc in the UK, 110pc to 151pc in Australia, 81pc to 111pc in Canada, 95pc to 136pc in the US and 114pc to 187pc in the Netherlands.  \"We hope to see the Irish figure grow strongly in the years ahead,\" Joseph O\\'Dea, head of investments at Willis Towers Watson in Ireland, who welcomed the introduction of auto-enrolment from 2022 as \"a good step in the right direction\".  \"Compulsory pension savings were introduced in Australia in 1992, and pension savings there now amount to 151pc of GDP,\" said O\\'Dea.  \"The recent political debate in Ireland over moving the retirement age back to 65 is an example of the dilemma of, and the conflict between, short-term versus long-term planning for governments and for society as a whole,\" he said.  The study is somewhat distorted because it uses GDP for consistency across countries even though GNP, which factors out foreign transfers, is more relevant to Ireland. But, he said, when calculated using GNP, the ratio of pension assets to the economy is still only about two-thirds.  \"This is still significantly behind the UK,\" he said. \"To an extent, this is explained by Ireland coming later to the table as a developed economy. The UK, with a more mature industrial history, has simply had more employment-related pension savings for much longer.  \"The state pension is significantly higher in Ireland than the UK so, in practice, some of the difference is made up for by the state paying higher pensions funded from taxation. Whether this will always be the case is unknown and there is no getting away from the fact that, as a nation, Ireland has saved less.\"',\n",
       " 'Money Marks & Spencer to close two UK distribution centres at a loss of hundreds of jobs It is understood that hundreds of staff members are affected -all of which have now entered a 30-day consultation period on how the closures will impact them long term  Marks & Spencer has confirmed plans to close two major distribution centres next year in a blow for hundreds of workers.  The retail giant said it will close its Thorncliffe distribution centre in Sheffield, in the summer of 2021.  It is understood that around 250 staff members are affected -all of whom have now entered a consultation period.  A further 330 workers are affected in Nottinghamshire, with the chain also confirming plans to axe its Long Eaton Distribution Centre -which is run by DHL -next year.  An M&S spokesman said: \"We\\'re in the early stages of changing our supply chain to address flow of product and availability for our customers.  \"As part of this we\\'ll no longer be serving our stores from our Thorncliffe and Long Eaton distribution centres.  \"Moving the operations is not a decision we\\'ve taken lightly but it\\'s an important change to help us best serve our customers as we move to a nationally connected network. Our logistics partners will be working closely with the colleagues at the sites on what is best for them.\"  The Thorncliffe warehouse is run by goods management company XPO Logistics which distributes stock for Marks & Spencer.  An XPO spokesperson said: \"Following a review of their operations, our customer has decided to withdraw its operations from the M&S Thorncliffe warehouse.  \"We have entered into a consultation period with colleagues, the trade union and elected employee representatives to finalise the plans.  \"We will work to support employees through this time.\"  Speaking on the Nottinghamshire closures, a DHL spokesman said: \"As M&S transitions to a nationally connected supply chain network it is proposing to close its Long Eaton regional distribution centre in spring 2021, with the DHL-operated transport office relocating to M&S distribution centre at Castle Donington.  \"Our affected warehouse staff have been informed and will shortly enter into consultation with the company and union representatives to discuss its implications and their options, including the possibility of redeploying to other DHL operations locally.  \"M&S stresses the decision is part of wider plans to modernise its supply chain and in no way reflects on the high levels of service delivered by the team at Long Eaton over the years.  \"We will continue to work in partnership with M&S at several of its nationally connected sites.\"  Usdaw, the union representing workers, said: \"This proposed closure has come as a shock and is devastating news for staff.  \"Usdaw will now enter into meaningful consultations with the company, where we will interrogate the business case and secure the best possible outcome for all affected.  \"In the meantime, we are providing our members with the support, advice and representation they need at this very difficult time.\"',\n",

       " 'Money High sharemarket vulnerable to shaky confidence Australian share prices have soared to record highs over the past year, with the most-quoted market index, the S&P/ASX 200, now at more than 7000 points.  Yet market watchers remain uneasy. They say any bad news could see the market\\'s momentum reverse and share prices fall significantly.  That\\'s against a backdrop of low consumer confidence.  The Westpac-Melbourne Institute\\'s measure of confidence released last week showed bushfires and poor air quality have dampened consumers\\' expectations about the economy\\'s future performance.  Peter Warnes, head of equities research at Morningstar, says the fires are likely to take up to half a point off Gross Domestic Product growth, mostly in the March quarter.  The Reserve Bank of Australia will meet for the first time this year on Tuesday and could cut the official cash interest rate to another record low. However, against the low levels of consumer confidence, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released last week show the unemployment rate at near-eight-year lows.  \"The Reserve Bank indicated that interest rates would fall further if the jobless rate rose,\" said Craig James, chief economist at CommSec. \"Well, the jobless rate is falling, rather than rising, suggesting that official rates may be left unchanged,\" he said.  Financial markets have the chance of a rate cut in February at 25 per cent. Any further cut to the cash rate would make the fully franked shares of the big dividend-paying companies even more attractive to investors, possibly driving the market higher, Mr Warnes said. But while it is possible that our market could go higher this year, it is already looking expensive.  Mr Warnes said the one-year forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) for the Australian sharemarket is 18 times, compared to the long-term average P/E of 14 times.  \"Investors have to be cautious and should consider taking some money out of the market,\" Mr Warnes said. \"You should bank some profits and squirrel some money away because when the correction comes you want the opportunity to go back into the market,\" he said.  Developed-world sharemarkets are hitting record highs as central banks flood their economies with liquidity. Elio D\\'Amato, executive director at Lincoln Indicators, said the liquidity is insulating many investors and economies from the \"harsh reality of sluggish economic growth\".  The upcoming earnings reporting season, which starts next month, will help determine the direction of the Australian sharemarket, he said.  \"In the lead-up to the reporting season we\\'ve seen earnings revisions, broadly, coming down - this is unusual and a real risk,\" he said.  Market researcher UBS said in a report last week that some companies in the retail, insurance, food and beverage, and transport sectors are likely to have the largest negative effects from the recent Australian bushfires.  Resources, building materials and infrastructure sectors are only likely to be mildly affected, analysts at the multinational investment bank and financial services company said.',\n",

       " \"1,841 financial advisers in FCA's crosshairs over DB advice Financial advisers who have completed defined benefit (DB) pension transfers are now under more pressure than ever to prove the work they have done was suitable for clients, a freedom of information request has revealed.  According to the results of a freedom of information request made by the pension consultancy Buck, the FCA is planning to write to 1,841 financial advisers regarding 'potential harm' done by their DB transfer advice. The figure represents 76% of the 2,426 advice firms who were advising people on their DB pensions between 2015 and 2018, the paper said.  In response to the revelation, Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent Nick Smith said that the FCA should intervene 'immediately' to identify clients who may have received a poor outcome. Smith's constituents were among those affected by what has been termed DB 'mis-selling' in Wales, following the revelations of poor advice in Port Talbot in 2017 and 2018.  'Now that we know how serious the situation is, we urgently need to know what is being done about it,' Smith said.  'The FCA should immediately contact customers at firms where there are problems.'  Last year, New Model Adviser® revealed that between 1,600 and 1,700 firms were in line to receive personalised letters from the regulator regarding their DB advice services, with the expectation that they provide detailed feedback to the FCA about the work they have done to prove its suitability.  That would not be the first time the FCA has written to advice firms. Just last week, the regulator penned a 'Dear CEO' letter to financial advisers warning that they must not rely on professional indemnity (PI) insurance policies that exclude DB advice, or include a high policy excess.  Along with DB transfers, PI insurance was noted by the regulator has a key cause for concern.  'We are concerned some financial advisers are holding inadequate financial resources and/or PI insurance for the business activities they carry out. This has been an issue with a number of the firms assessed as part of our work on DB pension transfer advice,' the Dear CEO letter said.  'Where this is the case, it increases the risk of firms being unable to put things right where they have caused harm to their clients. The inability to compensate consumers, and the transfer of these costs to other market participants via the Financial Services Compensation Scheme levy, is unfair and places an unnecessary burden on other firms. It also threatens confidence and participation in financial services markets.'  The regulator is yet to make a formal decision regarding the future of contingent charging models, which were placed under scrutiny in the wake of the pension freedoms as customers sought to cash out their DB pensions. Last year the FCA launched a consultation off the back of its intention to ban the practice, which permits advice firms to only receive a fee if a recommendation to transfer out goes ahead.\",\n",
       " 'money I am not changing my ways, says Fundsmith manager Terry Smith Britain\\'s most popular fund manager this week reported a 25.6 per cent return for 2019 on his flagship £18.8 billion Fundsmith Equity fund and mounted a defence of his investment style.  In his  tenth annual letter to investors in the fund  , Terry Smith made clear that he had no intention of bowing to demands from some investors that he change his strategy amid a  recent fall in performance  . He had made returns of 137 per cent over five years, making the fund a top performer, but in the past six months it has been at the bottom end of the charts with a lowly return of 0.7 per cent.  Smith, who is based in Mauritius and was last week revealed to have  paid himself £16 million last year  , sticks to a strategy: buy good companies, don\\'t overpay, then do nothing. This philosophy is known as growth investing. However, some critics have suggested that he should shift to a strategy known as value, where you pick stocks that look underpriced.  In defending his resolve to  stick to what has been a winning formula  , Smith says that while delivering another year\\'s juicy profit for investors he made a loss on only one of his stocks - a 0.2 per cent loss on 3M, the American conglomerate that makes thousands of products, including tapes and adhesives. His only sales were 3M and Colgate-Palmolive, the consumer goods giant, and he made two new purchases: Brown-Forman, the distiller of Jack Daniel\\'s Tennessee Whiskey, and Clorox, the American household and personal care products company.  In his letter Smith tackles head-on what he called the \"hardy perennial\" argument that it is time for a change of investment styles. He writes: \"The argument might be encapsulated thus: stocks of the sort our fund owns have had a good run of outperformance, as has the fund, but this is all about to end, or even already has ended, and so-called value investing - buying stocks mainly based upon their supposed under-valuation by the market - is making a comeback and funds which pursue this strategy are about to outperform us.\"  Smith says this strategy has flaws. \"Most of the stocks that have valuations which attract value investors have them for good reason - they are not good businesses. This means that the value investor who buys one of these companies, which are indeed lowly rated, but which rarely or never make an adequate return on capital, is facing a headwind. The intrinsic value of the company does not grow . . . or even erodes over time, while the value investor is waiting for the lowly valuation to be recognised and the share price rise to reflect this.\"  He adds: \"All of this was much more succinctly encapsulated by Warren Buffett when he said, \\'It\\'s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair company at a wonderful price.\\' \"',\n",

To get the deal, order any hot drink on the My McDonald\\'s app between 5am and 11am on January 19.  The app can be downloaded for free on Google Play     or the App Store    .  When you\\'re ready to go, head to the \"Deals\" section when the offer is live and you\\'ll be prompted to select what drink you want.  You can claim the freebie with any sized hot drink on the McCafe menu, with prices starting at 79p for an espresso.  A single McMuffin typically costs £2.49 if you go for sausage and egg, or bacon and egg, so you\\'d be saving £1.70 if you got an espresso.  For non-meat eaters, the cheese and egg McMuffin, usually priced at £2.09, is also included in the freebie - meaning a potential saving of £1.30.  Do note that prices vary between restaurants, so the exact amount you\\'ll save will depend on your location.  As the offer includes any hot drink, that means you can also claim your free grub with a £1.19 cup of tea or the more fancy Millionaires latte, priced at £1.89.  The deal is only good for single McMuffins - not doubles, sorry - and can only be redeemed once per customer.  But as this is a fresh deal, that means anyone who redeemed a free McMuffin earlier this month can technically go back and get another.  Appy Days deals, which are running until January 26, are available for new and existing customers on the app.  As they can\\'t be redeemed on Uber Eats, you\\'ll need to be near a Maccies to get one.  But the good news is the majority of McDonald\\'s 1,200 restaurants are participating in the month-long giveaway.  There are only 28 stores not taking part because they aren\\'t available on the app.  We suggest using the McDonald\\'s restaurant finder     to track down your nearest Maccies.  You can then check the terms and conditions of the offer when the deal goes live to make sure your closest branch is participating.  Make sure you eat McDonald\\'s responsibly though, as a bacon and egg McMuffin contains 310 calories, while a sausage and egg McMuffin has 430.

       " 'Why I\\'m Bullish Robotics And AI In 2020 As we enter 2020, it\\'s amazing how the media, and many investors, begin with such a negative vision about what can go wrong versus what can go right. Despite the pervasive sentiment that things are getting worse, people are richer, healthier, freer and safer than previous generations. Panic is in the air after the death of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.  But just as with the 2017 \"fire and fury\" episode with North Korea, such events are more likely indicative of coming peace, not coming war. In 2019 we climbed a wall of worry, overcoming fears from a trade war with China and yield curve inversion, among others. Now, we see a mid-cycle refresh that can extend the expansion. Going forward I believe investors need to focus their attention and dollars on the future, particularly in areas primed for disruption and not yet at premium valuations. The industry where we see this opportunity is robotics and artificial intelligence.  Why We\\'re Bullish  In December 2018, we articulated our extremely bullish view on this theme based on penetration rates being at their nascent beginnings and the ROBO Index being at its lowest levels in history. Today, valuations stand at historical averages, but earnings are set to enter a new upcycle.  As we move into 2020, we expect earnings to accelerate in both the ROBO and AI strategies, in contrast to anemic growth forecasts by most strategists. Early in 2019, we argued that in order to see a meaningful rotation of flows from the U.S to rest of world, investors would likely have to see sustained outperformance-or in other words, experience a little \\'FOMO\\'-however, given the trajectory of Cyclicals vs. Defensives throughout Q4, I think the argument could be made that we may be at that inflection point now.  With 56% of our portfolio outside North America, the ROBO strategy should benefit from international tailwinds and its balanced diversification. The Asian flu has subsided, and we are seeing improvements in factory automation.  However, Europe will be one area to watch in 2020, with the relative valuation discount vs the U.S. at 37%. With the Brexit overhang effectively cleared up, Eurozone equities could re-rate. And with 7% of ROBO in Germany alone we remain optimistic.  The fundamental building blocks of the 2020s will be robotics and artificial intelligence. Every industry and region is going on a journey to become more digital and more automated. It\\'s why we created two indexes to support this theme: the ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index (which is tracked by theRobo Global Robotics and Automation ETF (NYSE: ROBO)) and Robo Global Healthcare Technology & Innovation Index (which theRobo Global Healthcare Technology and Innovation ETF (NYSE: HTEC) tracks).  We are on the cusp of ubiquitous automation, which we believe will enhance productivity for society and returns for investors. The only question is how will you participate?

       " 'HOW GIVING UP ALCOHOL FOR NEW YEAR AND BEYOND COULD BAG YOU A \\'FREE\\' HOLIDAY People giving up alcohol during \"dry January\" and beyond could save enough money to splash out on far-flung holidays, according to research.  Even a short five-week \"no drinking\" stint could result in a couple saving enough cash for a two-night stay in Amsterdam, a study for foreign exchange firm Caxton found.  Going alcohol-free for 10 weeks could potentially in the equivalent of five nights in the sunny Algarve.  Giving up booze for a whole year could save enough for a week-long all-inclusive stay in Montego Bay, Jamaica, come this time next year, the research, carried out for Caxton by website Moneycomms.co.uk, found.  Researchers assumed a regular drinking habit of eight pints of beer and one bottle of wine per couple per week, bought from a bar or pub.  It was calculated that a self-imposed drinking ban could boost the financial health of a couple by as much as £44 per week typically - although pub and bar prices can vary hugely.  The research involved searching various travel websites earlier in December to see how far a couple\\'s weekly savings could take them.  It found that, for a couple, giving up alcohol for:  - Five weeks could bag a two-night stay in Amsterdam including flights, costing £218;  - Seven weeks could result in a three-night stay in Prague at £305;  - 10 weeks could pay for a five-night stay in the Algarve (Praia da Rocha) at £435;  - 17 weeks could fund a £740 trip to Naples for seven nights;  - 23 weeks could save enough for a £1,001 all-inclusive seven-night holiday at Egypt\\'s Red Sea;  - 33 weeks would be enough for a seven-night room-only stay in Barbados at £1,436;  - A full year (52 weeks) could buy a seven-night all-inclusive stay in Jamaica\\'s Montego Bay at £2,263 - flying out in January 2021.  Alana Parsons, chief operating officer at Caxton, said: \"Many of us enjoy a drink either to wind down in the evening or while out with friends or family at weekends, but we rarely tally up how much it costs us over the course of a year.  \"With the party season nearly behind us, thoughts naturally turn to making plans for the year ahead.  \"Extending the traditional dry January for a further few months or longer might not work for everyone, but a New Year Resolution that\\'s good for your health as well as your pocket is easier to stick to if you have a holiday on the horizon.  \"Planning your 2020 travel itinerary nice and early helps you bag the best holiday deals - but while you\\'re at it, don\\'t forget to check if your passports are still in date and that you\\'ve got your holiday currency, pre-paid currency card and travel insurance all sorted well in advance too.\"',\n",

       " \"Money,Shopping WRAP IT UP KFC reveals trick to make fried chicken Christmas dinner wrap KFC has revealed a festive menu hack so fast food fans can turn their Christmas leftovers into a fried chicken Yorkshire pudding wrap.  The step-by-step recipe details how diners can create their own Christmas-themed KFC snack from the comfort of their own home.  First, customers need to order Original Recipe KFC chicken, a tub of mash and gravy from the chicken chain.  We suggest doing this by ordering online, so you can relax and enjoy the food without leaving your house.  At home, you'll need to have at least one big leftover Yorkshire pudding, carrots and cranberry sauce.  Once your order has arrived, lay out the Yorkshire and add a layer of mash, carrots and stuffing balls.  KFC fried chicken Yorkshire pudding wrap  HERE'S the step-by-step guide from KFC so you can make your own fried chicken Yorkshire pudding wrap from home.  * Lay out the Yorkshire Pudding wrap and add a layer of mash  * Add the carrots on top of the mash  * Chop the stuffing balls in half and add to the wrap  * Slice the original recipe chicken and place on top  * Slather it in cranberry sauce  * Smother it in KFC gravy  * Roll up and tuck in  You'll then need to cut up the chicken and add it in, before finally smothering it in cranberry sauce and KFC gravy.  How much it'll cost depends on how much chicken you want to pack in - one piece of chicken costs £2.69, while two pieces is £4.49.  Mash and gravy are usually £1.59 each.  So say you order one piece of chicken, the total KFC order will come to £5.87 - or £7.67 for two pieces of chicken.  But if can't be bothered with the hassle of building the wrap yourself, you can buy an original recipe twister for the slightly cheaper price of £5.09.  The original recipe twister contains original recipe chicken, buttermilk dressing and pickled slaw in a tortilla wrap.  Do keep in mind that prices vary between restaurants.  You can order KFC via the official website, Deliveroo or Just Eat.  The cheapest for delivery is the KFC website, which will cost you £2.50 per order.  Deliveroo charges £3.49, while you'll pay £2.74 to get your food delivered from Just Eat.  If you do want to save on delivery costs, KFC has 890 restaurants in the UK - find your nearest one with its online store finder .  Calorie counters will want to know that a standard giant Yorkshire pudding contains around 266 calories, compared to 216 for a tortilla.  KFC's Christmas dinner box features a Festive Burger with fried hash brown and stuffing mayonnaise.  The fried chicken chain is also testing a massive 80 piece popcorn chicken bucket for £6.  This dedicated KFC worker, 68, has served up FIVE MILLION drumsticks during her 41 years at the fast food chain.\",\n",
       " 'Money,Shopping,Christmas 2019 FRESH-TIVE FEAST Seven-month-old spuds and eight-day-old pigs in blankets - how \\'fresh\\' is your Christmas dinner? SEVEN-MONTH-OLD spuds and eight-day-old pigs in blankets.  It doesn\\'t sound very appetising but that could be your Christmas dinner.  On Monday we told how turkeys being sold as \"fresh\" in supermarkets have really been slaughtered more than a month before and kept at sub-zero temperatures.  Nigel Broadhurst , of the British Frozen Food Federation, said: \"Most people are buying turkeys just before Christmas on the understanding it is a fresh bird. But they are not.\"  Here is how old the rest of your festive feast may be?  Potatoes: up to 7 months  Farmers harvest their spuds in October and it is possible to keep the vegetable in sheds throughout the winter.  But if they are stored in temperature and humidity-controlled warehouses, they can be kept for up to 11 months before being sent to be cleaned and packaged.  Pigs in blankets: up to 8 days  There can be a delay between the slaughter and the meat making its way to supermarket shelves.  Sainsbury\\'s has said it can take eight days for its pork to get from the abattoir to its stores.  Brussel sprouts: up to 3 days  Brassicas, such as sprouts, broccoli and cauliflower have a large surface area which absorbs oxygen, meaning they will spoil quickly.  Carrots & peas:up to 9 months  Carrots are often kept cool in chlorinated water just above 0C before packing to ensure they keep their crispness.  If kept in these conditions, mature topped carrots can last up to nine months before decaying.  Smoked salmon: up to 2 weeks  Farmed salmon is kept in chilled water and transported to supermarkets within days of being killed.  But wild salmon could already be a few weeks old when it hits shelves due to it being \"flash frozen\", a process where the fish is blasted with sub-zero air immediately after it is harvested.  Cheeseboard: up to 15 months  Cheese such as Cheddar is already ripe and will be vacuum-packed, so it may be several months old when you buy it in a store.  For extra mature varieties, the product can be aged for up to 15 months.  Chestnuts: up to 3 months  The harvest is usually mid-September through to November.  Once picked, the Christmas nut can be kept in a cool dry place for a few weeks, but could be older if bought frozen or tinned.  Bucks fizz: up to 2 years  Juices that are sold as \"not from concentrate\" will have either been treated with high pressure and filtering or pasteurised with heat.  And while suppliers will aim to shift all their produce as quickly as possible, juice can be stored in huge cold-storage tanks for up to two years without perishing.  * GOT a story?

       " 'Money,News Money GAME ON Pictionary Air TRIPLE the price on Amazon and eBay as top Christmas gift sells out in shops PARENTS are up in arms as must-have Christmas gift Pictionary Air is being sold for triple the price on Amazon and eBay after selling out in stores.  Mums and dads have been left furious after missing out on this year\\'s top selling present, which was being sold for £15 on Argos  before selling out.  After also selling out on Smyths Toys  and The Entertainer  websites, parents have been left paying three times this price on Amazon and eBay.  For example, the cheapest Pictionary Air is selling for on Amazon  is £48.87 - £33.87 more expensive than what Argos was charged.  On eBay , the lowest price we\\'ve seen for the game is £35.99 - which is still £20.99 more expensive and double the lowest price.  Pictionary Air is a modern take on the classic game, where what you draw in the air appears on your smart phone.  Previous sell-out Christmas toys included the Luvabella Doll in 2017, which sold for £99, and last year\\'s Hatchimals, which was £59.99.  Demand for the Christmas gift reached a peak last week when ITV presenter Philip Schofield demonstrated how to play it on his How To Spend It Well At Christmas show.  Smyths was selling Pictionary Air for £19.99, while it was going for £20 on The Entertainer website - making Argos the cheapest of the bunch.  Parents have since taken to Twitter to express their annoyance over the game selling out.  One person said: \"Just watched Philip Schofield and tried to buy the Pictionary Air game he recommended and unbelievably instead of £15.99, Amazon have more than doubled the price to £49.00. Shameful.\"  Someone else added: \"I usually buy a new game for the family to play on Christmas Day.  \"I was going to get Pictionary Air when I spotted it a few weeks back.  \"Now, it\\'s bloody sold out. EVERYWHERE. I\\'m not paying over double for it on eBay.\"  Parents might not need to pay more than the RRP for Pictionary Air, as high street stores may well get more stock in for Christmas.  However, this isn\\'t guaranteed so how much you\\'re willing to pay should be judged on how desperate you are to get the game.  If you want to hold out for the cheapest price, it\\'s worth contacting your local Argos, The Entertainer and Smyths Toys to see if they\\'re expecting more stock.  The Sun has contacted both Amazon and eBay and we\\'ll update this article if we get a response.  For more toys ideas for little ones, you might also want to check out Hamleys top ten toys for 2019.  Amazon has also revealed its top toys for Christmas 2019.  And if you want to save some cash, Christmas shoppers can save 20 per cent on toys at Argos when they spend £20 this week.',\n",
       " 'Money What to do if you accidentally transfer money to the wrong bank account Fat finger syndrome - mishaps when using your phone or laptop - can not only be embarrassing but costly too.  One person in eight transferred money to the wrong bank account last year and around a quarter of them never got their money back, according to a new study. The average amount for these misdirected payments was £118 - meaning that Brits could be losing as much as £204m a year.  So how can you avoid slip ups when making bank transfers and how can you get your money back if you do?  Staying safe when sharing details  More than half of misplaced payments were the result of customers making a mistake when inputting an account number or sort code, research by money transfer app VibePay found. Another common reason was having received the wrong details in the first place.  This can sometimes result from how we share our bank details with one another. Many of us will send them over via text message or WhatsApp, which can cause errors when copying and pasting information.  Luke Massie, the firm\\'s founder, added that sharing bank details in these ways can put customers\\' data at risk. Earlier this year, WhatsApp urged all of its 1.5 billion users to update their apps after it was hit by a security breach that would have allowed an attacker to read their messages.  When sending a large sum of money via bank transfer, you could give yourself an extra layer of protection by first sending over a smaller sum and checking it has been received before continuing with the full amount.  There\\'s an app for that  Some firms are developing apps that allow you to send money securely without having to input any details - saving you from falling victims to \"fat fingers\".  Digital bank Monzo allows you to transfer money to known contacts at the click of a button, although payments are restricted to other Monzo customers. Apps from the likes of Apple Pay, Barclays\\' Pingit and VibePay allow you to transfer money instantly to customers of any bank.  What to do when things go wrong  Accidents can always happen. If the details you inputted were invalid, the money should bounce back immediately. If not, let your bank know what has happened as soon as possible. It should take action within two working days to try to recover that money for you.  You should hear back from your bank within 15 working days on whether it will be able to return the transfer.  If the bank is unable to trace the money for you, you could try taking your complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service, a dispute resolution service.  From March 2020, customers will be given extra protection with the introduction of confirmation of payee. This will mean that when you input payments details, you will be informed if they do not match the name, number and sort code of the recipient account.',\n",

       " 'Money,News Money,Christmas 2019 VEGGIE SAD Brussels sprout shortage means they may be off the menu this Christmas BRUSSELS sprouts grown in the UK could be off the menu this Christmas as heavy rain has caused a shortage.  Growers are warning that it may soon be too late to save the vegetables because they\\'re now too wet.  The British Growers Association (BGA) said there is only a \"short timescale\" remaining for the weather to improve, The Grocer reports.  If it doesn\\'t, the controversial Christmas dinner veggies would have to be shipped in from abroad.  The same issue applies to cauliflowers and cabbages, as they\\'re all part of the so-called brassica crop.  Lincolnshire, where 60 per cent of the crop is grown, has suffered following the wettest year so far since 2012.  Here\\'s how to cut the cost of your grocery shop  WE spoke to Hannah Maundrell, editor of Money.co.uk, about how you can cut the cost of your shopping bills.  * Write yourself a list - Only buy items that you need. If it isn\\'t on your list, don\\'t put it in the trolley  * Create a budget - Work out a weekly budget for your food shopping  * Never shop hungry - you are far more likely to buy more food if your tummy is rumbling  * Don\\'t buy pre-chopped veggies or fruit - The extra they\\'ll charge for chopping can be eye watering  * Use social media - follow your favourite retailers to find out about the latest deals  * Be disloyal - You may want to go to different stores to find the best bargains  * Check the small print - It\\'s always worth checking the price per kg/lb/litre when comparing offers so you\\'re making a like for like decision as a bigger box won\\'t necessarily mean you get more  * Use your loyalty cards - Don\\'t be afraid to sign up to them all. They all work slightly differently - work out what bonus suits you better and remember to trade in your points for additional rewards  This has made the harvesting of the crops \"very difficult,\" Jack Ward, chief executive of BGA, told The Grocer.  As the vegetables are now wet, the cost of getting them out has risen for farmers while the disease risk has shot up too.  Mr Ward added: \"With the chances of things drying out being quite slim, the next step is starting to import [brassicas].\"  He suggested continued rainfall could increase the risk of shortages over Christmas but added it was \"too early to tell\".  The Sun has asked BGA how the shortage could impact the prices of the vegetables. We\\'ll update this article as soon as we get a response.  Last year, Brits were also warned about a Brussels sprout shortage after a heatwave scorched the crops.  While crisp and chip prices could rise after potato crops were ruined by flooding.  A beef shortage has also hit the UK, \"pushing up supermarket prices\" after protests by Irish farmers.',\n",
       " 'News Striking lecturers\\' pensions worth three times private sector average, say Vice Chancellors Lecturers have been told that their pension schemes are some of the best in the country and three times the private sector average ahead of planned strike action this month.  Universities UK (UUK), which represents vice-Chancellors, and Universities and Colleges Employers Association have written a joint letter to staff, urging them to call off eight days of industrial action which is due to begin on Monday.  Over a million students face disruption as academics from 60 universities signed up to strike over their pay and pension.  Members of the University and College Union (UCU) voted to back strike action in two ballots over pensions and pay and working conditions. Lecturers and other university staff will begin an eight day walk out on Monday.  UCU has been locked in a battle with UUK over proposed pension reforms to address a reported deficit and rising benefit costs.  The current dispute is over UCU members being forced to make increased contributions to maintain the same level of benefits. Employees are now paying in 9.6 per cent of their salary to the scheme rather than the 8 per cent they paid last year.  In the open letter, university chiefs said: \"USS is one of the very best pension schemes in the country, with average payments in retirement worth nearly three times the national average for private sector defined benefit schemes, and comparable to government backed public sector schemes.  \"This will not be affected by the changes resulting from the 2018 valuation and yet UCU have announced industrial action.\"  They called for \"constructive dialogue\" with UCU members ahead of Monday, adding that disrupting students\\' degrees would be \"deeply regrettable\".  But UCU hit back, accusing them being insincere about their offer to return to the negotiating table, since their letter said that they \"simply cannot afford to put more into this year\\'s pay increases than they already have\".  Jo Grady, general secretary of UCU, said: \"Universities\\' refusal to talk about pay smacks of game playing, as they must know an offer like this creates real difficulties in trying to resolve that dispute.  \"Nobody wants to take strike action, but we need to be talking about all the elements if we are to solve all the problems.\"  Earlier this week, a vice-Chancellor broke ranks to argue that universities can afford to pay more into the pension scheme.  Prof Anthony Forster of Essex University, said that trustees of the pension scheme were \"being overly prudent in their assumptions, which undervalue assets and overestimate liabilities\".  Last spring, lectures and classes were disrupted at more than 60 universities by 14 days of strikes across four weeks.  At the time, the row centred on proposals that would change the Universities Superannuation Scheme from a \"defined benefit\" scheme, which gives workers a guaranteed income in their retirement, to a purely \"defined contribution\" scheme, in which pensions are subject to fluctuations in the stock market.',\n",

Consumers have been warned to beware of scammers as one of the biggest online shopping days of the year approaches, \\'Black Friday\\'.  Ulster Bank today released the findings of its 2019 fraud survey in advance of the event, which takes place this year on Friday, November 29.  The Black Friday phenomenon started in the US. It is an informal name for the Friday following Thanksgiving Day, when shops traditionally slashed prices, and the concept has grown in popularity among retailers here in recent years.  The new research shows that the day has become an annual fixture on Irish calendars too, with over half of online shoppers (51pc) planning to spend the same or more online this Black Friday than last. Only 23pc of those surveyed said they would not be participating.  The research revealed that while 76pc of respondents felt they have taken all the necessary precautions to shop safely online, nearly a quarter (23pc) admitted they would sometimes take a chance on clicking a link if it promised a great deal.  Meanwhile, almost one in 10 adults who shop online claim to have shared their online banking pin or password with someone either verbally or online, with 23pc of those aged 18 to 24 having done so.  Also among the key findings of the survey was that twothirds of respondents (66pc) shop online at least once a month, with those aged 25 to 34 most likely to shop online with this frequency.  Some 38pc of online shoppers claimed they quite often or sometimes click on links without really giving thought to whether they are secure or not.  Almost six in 10 adults (59pc) who shop online claim they would not be that embarrassed to admit to their family or friends that they were a victim of online fraud.  The research also found that 30pc of online shoppers said it had been a year or longer since they reviewed or updated the software security on their laptop, tablet or PC.  Commenting on the results, cyberpsychologist Dr Ciaran McMahon said: \"The Black Friday phenomenon is all about the chance to bag a bargain before a deadline.  \"However, academic research shows that when faced with time pressures, we often make decisions that are more emotional and less analytical.  \"Scammers are hoping that we will drop our guard.\"  He said cybercrime was an increasingly sophisticated enterprise, but scammers had deadlines too.  \"Consumers can slow them down by simply stopping to think: is this deal too good to be true?\" added Dr McMahon.  Consumers were advised to be vigilant and cautious about what they disclose on social media and take precautions to ensure their profile is private.  \\'Consumers can slow them down by thinking: is this deal too good to be true?\\'',\n",

Prior to filing the probate petition, the daughter sought to be appointed administrator of the decedent\\'s estate.  The decedent died on February 16, 2019, at the age of 82. The propounded instrument was attorneydrafted and supervised, consists of three typewritten pages, bears the signatures of three witnesses and contains an attestation clause, to which an affidavit of attesting witnesses is appended. On the lower half of the first page of the typewritten instrument, there is a handwritten circle around the last sentence and the notations \"changes; Frenchie Slade not Jack Slade [the alternate residuary beneficiary] - not well - ill,\" and on page two there is a handwritten ink check mark immediately to the left of paragraph FIFTH, the word \"changes\" at the margin to its right and a line drawn through \"JAMES SLADE as my executor\"; and the notation \"(Explain)\" is handwritten immediately to the left of Paragraph SIXTH.  In support of the probate petition, the daughter filed an affidavit stating that it was only after she filed a petition seeking letters of administration that she discovered the propounded instrument among her mother\\'s household effects; she is familiar with her mother\\'s handwriting; and it appears that the handwritten notations on the propounded instrument were made after its execution. The petitioner continues that these handwritten notations were made by the decedent because the petitioner\\'s husband, James Slade, became ill and died on September 10, 2015. She submits a letter from the attorney drafted who supervised execution of the original will, stating that the decedent was given her original will after execution and enclosing a photocopy of the executed instrument that contains no alterations.  The proof establishes that the handwritten alterations to pages one and two of the instrument occurred after its execution, do not comply with the statutory formalities and cannot be given testamentary effect (see EPTL 3-4.1; Matter of Martinez, NYLJ, Dec. 31, 2007 at 37, col 4 [Sur Ct, Bronx County 2007]).  The court is satisfied that the testator executed the will dated April 11, 2007 in its original form in compliance with the statutory requirements, and that, at the time of execution, the testator was competent to make a will and was free from restraint. Accordingly, the will is admitted to probate in its original, unaltered form (see EPTL 3-2.1, SCPA 1408), and the petition seeking letters of administration is hereby dismissed.  Decree signed.

       " 'News Super splash out THE superannuation giant investing the nest eggs of millions of Australian workers has been splashing out on lavish sponsorship and corporate hospitality, including tickets to an American baseball game, golf tournaments and CFMEU dinners.  IFM Investors, which is owned by 27 Australian industry funds, has spent millions on sponsorship, hospitality and marketing since 2014.  Its members include teachers, nurses, tradies and workers on the minimum wage including cleaners and hospitality workers.  Documents seen by the Herald Sun show the Melbourne-headquartered IFM bought tickets valued at more than $6000 to a Boston Red Sox baseball game, $14,000 for CFMEU dinners and $21,000 on reusable coffee cups.  More than $68,000 was spent on golf days and tournament sponsorships over the five-year period.  In April, $50,000 was given to the Australian Ballet through sponsorship and $2000 was spent at ski championships in the US.  IFM also spent $1300 with the Progressive Business Association, which raises funds for the Victorian Labor Party, and $9644 for \"development of talking points for IFM investors expansion\\'\\' in 2017.  The figures are contained in documents provided by IFM Investments to the House of Representatives\\' standing committee on economics, ahead of public hearings next week.  The committee is looking at the superannuation sector in the wake of the Hayne royal commission into the big banks and financial institutions, and pressuring the fund managers to explain how spending on sponsorships and corporate entertainment provides value for their clients.  \"Why are teachers, nurses and hospital cleaners\\' superannuation being used to send executives to Boston Red Sox games?\" committee chairman Tim Wilson said.  \"Superannuation is a model of trust, but when industry super executives are living the high life on the super of low-paid workers, that trust is broken.\" Mr Wilson, Liberal member for the Victorian seat of Goldstein, said the \"culture of greed\\'\\' identified in the finance sector by the Hayne royal commission was also at play in the superannuation field.  \"It\\'s clearly still going on inside industry superannuation funds at the expense of low-paid worker\\'s retirement security,\" he told the Herald Sun.  IFM Investments, set up almost 25 years ago to invest the pooled funds of a group of Australian union superannuation funds, is now a global business with $152 billion of funds under management.  Chaired by former ACTU head and Labor minister Greg Combet, it has offices in Melbourne, Sydney, New York, London, Berlin, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Seoul and Zurich and owns a sizeable portion of assets in Australia including Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide airports.  Through a subsidiary, it has a 30-year deal with the Victorian government to own, operate and maintain Southern Cross Station.  An IFM Investors spokesman described the spending as \"modest\". \"Our expenses, sponsorship and marketing activity is modest for a global fund manager of our size,\" the spokesman said.  \"Our sponsorship of union events is a normal activity given they are a stakeholder.\"tamsin.rose@news.com.au',\n",
       " 'Warren, Clyburn say solution for student debt vital for HBCUs Claflin University; Orangeburg, SC - news  By SARINA PARKER and JORDAN JAMES  Warren, Clyburn say solution for student debt vital for HBCUs  By: SARINA PARKER and JORDAN JAMES  Nov 10, 2019  Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Congressman James Clyburn conduct a town hall meeting at S.C. State. (Panther photo by Tariq Edwards)  With 45 million Americans holding more than $1.5 trillion in student loan debt, S.C. Congressman James E. Clyburn and Massachusetts Sen. and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren are proposing a legislative solution.  The two held a town hall meeting at South Carolina State University on Oct. 9 to promote their Student Loan Debt Relief Act. They selected historically black S.C. State as a site to emphasize the negative impact of student debt on students at HBCUs.  \"Student loans impact many students and graduates across the country, but we are paying close attention to the impact it has on students and grads at historically black colleges and universities,\" Clyburn said.  \"We\\'re disproportionately crushing a generation of students of color,\" Warren said. \"That is not how a country builds a future and we gotta change that.\"  Clyburn said HBCUs and the students they educate are vital.  \"HBCUs take diamonds from the sea islands and other underserved communities and they take those students and help turn those diamonds from roughness to valuable commodities,\" he said.  \"We\\'re not going to get this through before 2021. ... We want to lift it up now, we want to build momentum, we want to build pressure behind it,\" Warren said of the legislation she is sponsoring along with Clyburn.  The Student Loan Debt Relief Act would substantially reduce the black-white and Latina-white wealth gaps, while increasing wealth for black and Latinx families.  \"We wipe out the existing student loans debt and then we set up pathways so nobody has to take on this debt ... in the future,\" Warren said.  The act would cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt for borrowers with $100,000 or less in household gross income. Also, it would provide automatic cancellation using data already available to the federal government about household income and outstanding student loan debt.  Clyburn and Warren say the legislation will boost the economy through:  ? Consumer-driven economic stimulus  ? Improved credit scores  ? Greater home-buying rates and household stability  ? Higher college completion rates  ? Greater business formation  The elected leaders point to the damage student debt is doing to individual economies and to the economy overall.  \"If you don\\'t have anybody who\\'s dealing with student loan debt, you still should care because it is affecting our entire economy,\" Warren said.  They argue that stagnant wages, labor market discrimination and rising costs of living have made it nearly impossible for individuals to repay their student debt.  Over the last five years, student loan debt has grown by 30% in the Palmetto State, according to Experian.  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))',\n",
       " 'Money Mamas & Papas goes into administration just six days after Mothercare The company, which had 27 stores and three concessions, said its remaining stores will continue to trade as normal, as well as its digital, wholesale and concession arms  High street childrenswear chain Mamas & Papas has gone into administration just days after Mothercare\\'s collapse.  The retailer has axed six stores and made 73 staff redundant with immediate effect -a further 54 roles are now at risk at its Huddersfield head office.  Bluegem Capital, which has owned the business since 2014, has bought the company assets through a pre-pack administration which will cut some of its financial liabilities.  Mamas & Papas said its unprofitable stores in Aberdeen, Preston, Milton Keynes, Lincoln, Leamington and Fareham closed on Friday as a result.  The administration, conducted by Deloitte, came after it was put under pressure as its shoppers moved online and high street footfall continued to decline.  The company, which had 27 stores and three concessions, said its remaining stores will continue to trade as normal, as well as its digital, wholesale and concession arms.  However, it has announced plans to \"simplify\" operations at its head office in Huddersfield, which could lead to further job losses.  It was founded in 1981 in Huddersfield by David and Luisa Scacchetti and rapidly grew but was bought by Bluegem after a restructuring process five years ago.  Riccardo Cincotta, executive chairman of Mamas & Papas, said: \"These actions are always difficult but they are also necessary in a challenging market to ensure Mamas & Papas achieves its considerable future potential.  \"We remain fully focused on maintaining our position as the UK\\'s most popular nursery brand.  \"We will continue to review our store portfolio in the light of customers\\' changing behaviour and we remain fully committed to an omni-channel offering that reflects their evolving needs.\"  The retailer said all customer orders, including outstanding orders placed with the closed stores, are unaffected by the administration and will be \"delivered on time without disruption\".

       " 'General News Children \\'will have to wait\\' Caitlin, a 27-year-old Wellington professional, pays $235 a week towards renting a room in a flat with her partner and sees $200 a fortnight go out of her wages to pay off her $60,000 student loan. She says starting a family will have to wait.  \"I wouldn\\'t want to have children when I\\'m renting,\" she says.  \"I had to move this year when the landlord wanted to put the rent up by $200 a week. We offered to pay $100 more and they refused, and I don\\'t want to be in that situation if I have children.  \"I would like to own a house and then think about it, but that\\'s five or 10 years away.  \"And I\\'m in a privileged position. I have quite a secure job, I have a regular salary. There would be lots of people in a much worse position than I am.\"  Landscape architect Lance Millward, 47, says he and his wife Joleen, a teacher, went to Japan in 2001 after graduating so they could earn enough to pay off student loans of about $52,000 between them.  \"At the time it was very good income there and the cost of living was cheaper than Auckland,\" he says.  But the cost was postponing their family.  \"Our children are 8 and 11 now, most of my friends have high school-aged kids, so you end up with everything quite a lot delayed,\" he says.  \"That means you\\'re kind of forced into having a smaller family unless you take the risk of having children after 40, which they don\\'t recommend.\"  Student loans have only been one factor in delayed home ownership and childbearing.  They made up only 4 per cent of total NZ household after-tax annual incomes by 1998 and 9 per cent today, while total household debts have soared from 75 per cent of after-tax household income to 125 per cent.  A 2003 study by Waikato University economists John Gibson and Grant Scobie found that the chances of a non-partnered person owning their home were reduced by 60 per cent if they had an outstanding student loan, after allowing for age, income sources and other factors.  But they found the opposite effect for couples. Couples were actually 11 per cent more likely to own their own homes if they had a student loan, even after allowing for other factors - perhaps because of factors that could not be measured such as stable career paths and perseverance.  Consequently, Gibson and Scobie found that student loans had no significant effect on the number of children that people had.  A study this year by Wellington economist Isabelle Sin and Stanford\\'s Ran Abramitzky found that domestic students completing bachelor\\'s degrees between 2005 and 2013 were slightly less likely to have children within six years of graduating if they had bigger student loans when they graduated, but again the difference was not statistically significant.',\n",
       " 'Pensions Govt urged to fund pensions for mothers and carers The government should pay the minimum auto-enrolment contribution to the private pensions of women who leave work to care for their children or elderly relatives, a think tank has said.  In its second report on how the 100-year life may affect Britain\\'s society, published today (October 28), the Social Market Foundation made five recommendations for action as it warned longer lives could amplify existing differences between male and female earnings and savings.  In Gender equality and the 100-year life, the think tank wrote: \"As people retire later, the length of time in work will increase and wage disparities may continue to increase.  \"This has the potential to deepen the divide between the financial position of men and women during and after their working lives.\"  To stop the gap widening, the government should consider paying into the pension pots of women who take time out of work to care for others, it stated.  In 2016, the Office for National Statistics estimated that a woman on maternity leave carries out weekly unpaid work with an economic value of £762.75, well above the average regular weekly wage.  Applying the current 3 per cent auto-enrolment minimum contribution to such a value would mean a new government contribution of £22.88 per week, or £1189.89 per year, to that woman\\'s pension pot.  The think tank also recommended it should be mandatory for companies to publish their pension policies when advertising job vacancies, with the goal to encourage workers to pay more attention to their long-term pension accumulation.  According to the SMF the Financial Conduct Authority also has a role to play in this area, as its data on individuals accessing their pension pot could be split by gender to highlight any differences in the decisions being made.  According to Kathryn Petrie, chief economist at the SMF, rising lifespans are a good thing, \"but if we don\\'t have the right policies to respond, they could amplify financial differences between men and women\".  She added: \"We should celebrate the 100-year-life but also accept that it has the potential to deepen the divide between the financial position of men and women during, and after, their working lives.  \"To prevent the pension gap widening further, the government should consider contributing directly to the pension pots of individuals who take time out of the labour market to have children or to care for family members.  \"For all the strides we\\'ve made towards equality, social attitudes that push women to give up work to care for children and parents remain strong.  \"As well as trying to give women and men more flexibility and choices, government policies should do more to help women with the financial implications of taking time out of work.\"  maria.espadinha@ft.com  What do you think about the issues raised by this story?

       " \"Money Seek some help if you are an addictive shopper There is a lot of talk about spenders and savers in the media. There are books written about shopaholics and even a movie, but very little is written about the serious side of financial compulsion and addiction.  In a US study, The Prevalence of Compulsive Buying, researchers discovered that compulsive shopping affects about 6 per cent of people and women are nine times more likely to be affected than men. However, I believe that compulsive buying is likely to increase for men with the evolution of digital commerce. It is simply much faster and easier to spend now than ever before.  The researchers discovered shopping addiction can have many harmful consequences. Among compulsive shoppers:  58 per cent have large debts.  42 per cent can't make their debt payment.  45 per cent experience guilt about their shopping.  33 per cent are criticised by friends and family about their shopping.  8 per cent have financial legal problems.  8 per cent have criminal legal problems.  While the book series Shopaholic might seem cute and funny, compulsive shopping isn't a laughing matter. Shopping is something we're actively encouraged to do by the advertising industry, retailers and our peers. As a result, compulsive shopping is often normalised.  Unfortunately, as with other addictive behaviours such as gambling, compulsive eating or substance abuse, raw willpower doesn't always work to help you stop.  A review of a compulsive buying disorder study (among others), found that 92 per cent of compulsive shoppers try on their own to curb their shopping habits without success, until they address an underlying problem. That's because shopping is often a coping mechanism.  Now, some people might read this and think people over-shop because they are bored or unmotivated. This is different - it's compulsive, it's secretive. It's also something that while you experience an initial high, the truth is you're deeply ashamed of your behaviour.  If you have compulsive and addictive financial behaviour (I've only mentioned shopping but it may also be gambling) there are organisations that can help.  If you're in debt, speak to a counsellor at the National Debt Hotline on 1800 007 007.  There are also organisations such as Good Shepherd Microfinance, who offer no-interest loans and fair and affordable financial programs to people on low incomes. Or seek help from a registered therapist.  The truth is, our modern life is handing so many of us who have compulsive tendencies with the right tools to ruin our financial futures. From mobile shopping to easy access to credit and buy-now-pay-later apps, it's easier than ever before to fall into financial trouble and not know how to stop.  If you suspect you suffer from financial compulsion or addiction, don't give in to shame. Understand this issue is real and seek help.

       " 'News TUE Employers urged to help boost pensions Employers may have to step in to narrow the savings gap on pensions, according to research from Mercer  Now in its eleventh year, the Melbourne Mercer Global Pensions Index (MMGPI) compares 37 retirement systems across the globe and covers almost two-thirds of the world\\'s population. It intends to highlight the broad spectrum and diversity of the world\\'s pension systems, demonstrating that even the world\\'s best systems have shortcomings.  This year it ranked the UK in 14th place globally and graded it a C+, with an overall value index score of 64.4. The Netherlands had the highest index value (81), and has consistently held first or second position for 10 out of the past 11 MMGPI reports. Thailand had the lowest index value at 39.4.  The UK ranked highly on integrity, with a score of 84 out of 100. But it ranked low on sustainability (55) and adequacy, which was scored at 60.  Recommendations for improving the UK\\'s system centred around raising the minimum pension for low-income ??, and increasing contributions to workplace pension schemes and coverage for self-employed.  For each sub-index, the highest scores were Ireland for adequacy (81.5), Denmark for sustainability (82.0) and Finland for integrity (92.3). The lowest scores were Thailand for adequacy (35.8), Italy for sustainability (19.0) and Philippines for integrity (34.7).  Globally, the research showed a strong correlation between the levels of pension assets and net household debt, with growth in household debt in developed and growth economies paired with the growth in assets held by pension funds.  Benoit Hudon, head of wealth at Mercer UK, said employers should be doing more to improve the UK\\'s \\'adequacy\\' rating and ensure employees have enough to retire on. \"The UK retirement system\\'s strong score for integrity needs to be matched by improving adequacy, in other words what people actually receive in retirement,\" he said.  He added that better education around pensions could increase engagement: \"A lack of understanding of what they will receive and what they will actually need in retirement has led to a gap in retirement savings for many employees. This begs the question as to whether employers should play a greater role, both in educating and supporting their workforce.  \"Taking a more active role in securing employees\\' retirement could support engagement and productivity, and help attract top talent,.\"  While each pension system has a unique set of circumstances, the report highlights that there are common improvements which can be made to the challenges all regions face, added David Knox, senior partner at Mercer and author of the study.  \"Systems around the world are facing unprecedented life expectancy and rising pressure on public resources to support the health and welfare of older citizens,\" he said. \"It\\'s imperative that policymakers reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of their systems to ensure stronger long-term outcomes for the retirees of the future.\"',\n",
       " 'View This is almost the worst possible Brexit deal - but at least it\\'s a deal; Last-minute agreement doesn\\'t remove economic problems Boris Johnson has signed a deal he said he didn\\'t need, creating a border he didn\\'t want, under the authority of a Court he didn\\'t accept, to be submitted to a Parliament he doesn\\'t control.  The one \"great\" thing about the agreement with the European Union that the UK prime minister hailed Thursday is that it reduces the possibility of a hard Brexit, and the associated foreseeable economic crisis.  But beyond the forex market\\'s obvious relief at the possible end of three years of uncertainty - the pound jumped almost 1% on the news, before reversing - this is still a deal that will hurt the British economy.  On a scale of 1 to 10 - from no-pain, remain in the EU to maximum damage, no-deal Brexit - the agreement concluded just a few hours before an EU leaders summit in Brussels registers as an 8 or 9.  Its economic impact will be worse than the deal negotiated by Johnson\\'s predecessor Theresa May and rejected three times by the UK Parliament earlier this year. That is true both in the short term and in the long term.  In the short term, it leaves the UK outside the customs union where it would have stayed under the infamous \"backstop\" negotiated by the previous government. But more uncertainty is also hanging over the near term economic future.  The dearth of investment in the last three years has been the main drag on the UK economy, which explains why the country\\'s GDP is now 1-to-3% lower than it would have been if voters had opted for remain in 2016.  New elections are looming, setting up a border in the Irish sea is rife with practical difficulties, and starting talks with the European Union on a future trade deal will prove challenging after so much goodwill evaporated in the last three months.  The economy will also suffer in the longer term. Reduced trade with the EU and limits on immigration will hit the economy. The UK in a Changing Europe, a think tank, estimates that compared to remaining in the EU, GDP would be lower in ten-year\\'s time by between 2.3% and 7% - a bigger hit than if the May deal had been approved.  But the political background will count too. Johnson\\'s government is not seeking to conclude with the EU an agreement on a \"future relationship\" that would keep both sides closely intertwined. It is just seeking a bare-bones free trade deal, meaning it will pay an economic price for its political choices.

       " 'News Candidates share their ideas on addressing housing shortage Housing shortages continue to be a significant issue in ridings across the country including Timmins-James Bay.  During the federal all-candidates\\'debate held at the Porcupine Dante Club this week, the four candidates who attended the event - Charlie Angus who is running for the New Democratic Party, Michelle Boileau of Liberal Party of Canada, Kraymr Grenke of the Conservative Party of Canada and Renaud Roy of the People\\'s Party of Canada - were asked how their respective governments would provide incentives for new housing and help address the shortage of accommodations.  Grenke: \"As we look to expand our markets here in the North, we have to ensure our supports are with those who want to move here. That\\'s a prime example where we have to ensure we are investing ... we need to invest in infrastructure. We want people to have good value on the piece of property and the building that they\\'re investing into\" so they can get good \"resale value down the road. By ensuring that we have those points in place, moving forward, that the value can be attained and to ensure there is essentially enough housing availability for people.\"  Angus: \"We need to get a national housing program. Unfortunately, the Liberal government housing program put in less money than the previous Conservatives. We need to double the first-time homeowner credit. We need to allow for the 30-year mortgages. We have to take the HST off new housing starts so we can kick-start investment ... We need to start putting housing projects on the ground, particularly in Timmins where we see seniors with young families, and with Indigenous families as well.\"  Roy: \"Forty per cent of the immigrants coming to Canada get established in cities of Toronto and Vancouver. So you can imagine that puts a very heavy load and it limits the amount of housing available. In, for example Iroquois Falls, we have seniors that have actually invested into non-profits and non-departmental organization but it\\'s working in cooperation with CDSSAB (Cochrane District Social Services Administration Board). And I believe we can establish a lot of these things but not under the complete control of the government. Government should be a facilitator and not so much a provider.\"  Boileau: \"We (the Liberals) do have a national housing strategy that was just introduced, and so definitely it\\'s a question of maintaining that and continuing to build on that ... We also see additional investment on top of the $200.7 million that was invested back in the 2016 budget; additional investments on top of that for senior housing so to encourage construction, renovations, and adaptation to make seniors housing more accessible. So definitely there is a plan to add stock to housing.\"  While all five candidates were invited to participate, Max Kennedy, who is running for the Green Party of Canada, was not able to attend due to work commitments.',\n",
       " \"5 Easy Ways To Plan A Vacation On A Budget Taking a vacation doesn't have to cost you a fortune, especially if you can be flexible about the location, timing and activities. Make sure to decide on your budget and define your priorities. Once you have established that, you can begin to plan your dream vacation.  Here are five tips on how to vacation on a budget.  Plan A National Park Vacation  The United States has some gorgeous parks that are right in your backyard. It's a great way for you to see an unforgettable landscape, see wildlife in its natural habitat and learn more about the culture of the local people.  Each year, the National Parks will offer five free days to all their parks.  You could also consider purchasing an inexpensive pass that allows you to visit more than 2,000 parks around the country.  Travel During The Offseason  Visiting locations is one of the best ways to save money. However, you do have to deal with the weather not being as ideal. The good news is that not only is it usually cheaper, but there are also fewer crowds as well. Rome is much more pleasant in the offseason then when you have to fight the crowds to see the Vatican.  Of course, peak season varies from place to place. Doresearch online to see more about what your dream location's peak season is.  Jump On Deals  Many different airlines, like Southwest (NYSE: LUV), will offer fares for low prices. As long as you are willing to be flexible about your dates and travel location.  If you have your eyes on a cruise, make sure to book during the promotional periods. Many cruises will offer deals in the first few months of the new year. Norwegian Cruise (NYSE: NCLH) and many other cruise lines will slash their prices to encourage people to book cabins.  See Also: How To Financially Prepare For Vacation  Use Credit Rewards Points  Another fantastic way to plan a vacation on a budget is to sign up for a rewards credit card like Discover It (NYSE: DSF) Miles. Many of the travel credit cards will give you huge bonus points if you spend a certain amount of opening the cards.  Most of the time, those points can be cashed in for a free flight, hotel stays, or give you cashback. All the money you spend on your vacation can be cashed in later for fun on later holidays.  Find A Vacation Close By  If you can't afford an expensive plane ticket or an extended vacation, there are likely tons of options for vacations within a few hours of your house. Try to find an amusement park that you haven't gone to before, or go to a small lake nearby for a peaceful day at the beach.  Your vacation doesn't have to break the bank to be fun and memorable!  © 2019 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved.\",\n",
       " 'Students: Don\\'t Miss Out on Crucial Financial Aid Dollars NASFAA resources can help demystify the process of applying for student financial aid.     WASHINGTON, Sept. 30, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- As temperatures drop and the leaves start to change colors, we\\'re heading into a new season. Yes, fall is upon us, and it\\'s also the start of a new financial aid cycle. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, for the 2020-21 academic year will become available to students and families on Tuesday, October 1 and the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) has resources to help applicants complete the form without issues.  NASFAA encourages students to complete the FAFSA online or via the myStudentAid mobile app, rather than submitting a paper FAFSA, as the electronic versions utilize skip-logic that prevents students from having to answer questions it\\'s clear don\\'t apply to them based on their previous answers. There is no hard deadline to submit the FAFSA, but because many states and colleges use the FAFSA to determine eligibility for non-federal student aid funds that may have limited funding, the sooner a student submits the FAFSA, the more aid they could be eligible for.  However, rushing through the application isn\\'t recommended, as data-entry mistakes can slow down the process. Students can cut down on errors by using the Internal Revenue Service\\'s online Data Retrieval Tool to import their financial information directly from their tax returns into the FAFSA, rather than entering it manually. They can also reduce errors by referring to NASFAA\\'s recently updated checklist of what students should have on-hand in order to file their FAFSA and list of common FAFSA errors to avoid.  \"Millions of dollars in student aid funds get left on the table every year because qualified students fail to complete their application,\" said NASFAA President Justin Draeger. \"We know the process can be confusing, but we urge you not to let unasked questions or an unsubmitted application be the obstacle that stands between you and obtaining the funds to pursue a higher education. Financial aid administrators on college campuses all over the country stand ready to help current and prospective students navigate the process of applying for student aid.\"  To request an interview with a NASFAA spokesperson about what students and parents should know before filing the FAFSA, please email powerse@nasfaa.org or call (202) 785-6959.  About NASFAA  The National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA) is a nonprofit membership organization that represents more than 28,000 financial aid professionals at nearly 3,000 colleges, universities, and career schools across the country. NASFAA member institutions serve nine out of every ten undergraduates in the United States.

Chase has fantastic business experience and specializes in healthcare legal areas including medspa compliance, physician employment, new physician employment contracts, new medical business start-up agreements and estate planning. Many of these areas are already covered by the firm but the demand for experienced attorneys has increased with the rapid growth of medical businesses, especially online.  \"You have so many businesses coming up online that do not have a physical office, but they still see patients, using telehealth, for instance. There are CBD and medical marijuana companies who also want to start marketing and selling their products and need legal guidance. Believe it or not, medical-related businesses have grown by over 50% in the past five years and that\\'s a trend that isn\\'t going to stop anytime soon. To ensure quality of care, government regulations must be followed.

       " 'How to Protect Yourself From Financial Fraud Bowling Green State University ; Bolwing Green, OH - news  By  (StatePoint) There are more than 300,000 professional financial advisors in the U.S. It\\'s fair to say that a majority are dedicated to helping their clients achieve their financial goals. However, some unethical individuals seek to take advantage of clients\\' trust and lack of financial knowledge to benefit themselves.  You should look for any signs of fraudulent or unethical practices when working with a financial advisor. These include:  - Not receiving any reports on your investments, or only getting them directly from your advisor.  - Your advisor completing forms for you. A well-intentioned but careless financial professional can get your information wrong; an unethical professional might falsify data.  - Receiving information from your advisor not on company stationery or sent via a personal email address. Your advisor could be offering you an opportunity that his employer does not know about.  - Your advisor pressuring you to make quick decisions on a recommended transaction, which may be described as a \"limited time offer\" or presented when you are going through a major life change, such as a personal loss.  - Your advisor offering an opportunity that sounds too good to be true -- such as a high-return investment without risk -- or declining to provide details about the opportunity because \"it\\'s too complicated.\"  These behaviors could be red flags that you are vulnerable to financial abuse. Fortunately, there are several simple steps you can take to protect yourself from unscrupulous advisors:  - Ask your financial professional if they are a fiduciary. This obligates them to base their recommendations on your best interests, fully disclosing any conflicts of interest (actual, potential or perceived). If your advisor avoids the question or doesn\\'t understand the term, go elsewhere.  - Get confirmation, in writing, that the advisor\\'s employer or company approves and supervises recommended investments. If your financial professional is a sole practitioner, verify that she carries professional liability insurance.  - Always ask your advisor how much a proposed transaction will cost you and if he will get paid from the recommended transaction.  - Tell your advisor when you don\\'t understand something. Ethical professionals will be happy to explain. If you don\\'t understand the explanation, ask for it to be put in simpler terms.  - Make sure you receive regular statements from independent third-party sources or verify that the investment manager is audited annually by a reputable independent accounting firm.  - Never leave blanks in paperwork that someone else could fill in without your knowledge or consent. Ask your advisor to send you copies of all final, submitted documents.

Identifying and avoiding the potential for financial fraud or malpractice is key to a successful, trustworthy partnership with your financial advisor that will help you achieve your goals.  *****  Photo Credit: (c) fizkes / iStock via Getty Images Plus  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))',\n",
       " 'Business Realtors demand looser mortgage rules; Also call on federal candidates to boost first-time buyers credit Real estate boards across the country are calling on federal candidates in next month\\'s election to support loosening mortgage stress tests, saying that will make it easier for Canadians to buy homes.  \"The federal government should view the stress test as a flexible policy and adjust it based on changing economic trends and interest rates,\" the Toronto Real Estate Board wrote in a statement released Thursday morning.  Introduced in 2018, the mortgage stress test requires potential buyers - even those with a down payment of 20 per cent or more - to demonstrate that they can afford a mortgage (or home equity line of credit) at a rate two percentage points above the rate being offered or at the Bank of Canada\\'s five-year benchmark rate, whichever is higher.  The stricter mortgage rules were introduced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to shore up the underwriting of banks as Canadian household debt hit record levels. The stress test also helped to cool overheated housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver.  Real estate boards representing realtors from Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver and Edmonton, as well as real estate associations in Quebec and Nova Scotia, have all signed on to Thursday\\'s statement.  The coalition of about 92,000 realtors is also calling on parties to reinstate 30-year mortgages and replace the $750 first-time home buyers tax credit with a $2,500 non-refundable one instead.  They argue the current guideline enforces a \"one-size-fits-all solution\" that\\'s to the detriment of many.  \"Quebec\\'s home ownership rate continues to lag, according to the 2016 census, as it stands at 61 per cent in Quebec compared to more than 70 per cent in Canada\\'s other provinces,\" Julie Saucier, the president of Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers, said in the statement.  \"We believe that there needs to be better support offered to buyers of residential properties, particularly first-time buyers.\"  In April, CIBC World Markets deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal released a report showing at least half of the $25-billion decline in new mortgages since 2018 was due to the introduction of the stress test.  The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. has maintained in the past that mortgage stress tests are needed to prevent property price inflation. \"My job is to advise you against this reckless myopia and protect our economy from potentially tragic consequences,\" CMHC president and CEO Evan Siddall wrote in May in a letter to the Standing Committee on Finance.  Siddall said banks have supported the loosening of the regulation only because they\\'re backed by a guarantee from the federal government.  \"I doubt they\\'d be as cavalier if it were their risk,\" he told the Star in late May. \"Critics of the stress test ignore the fact that high house prices are the overwhelming reason why home ownership is out of reach.\"',\n",
       " \"Saving & banking Sharia bank Al Rayan launches a 1.6% easy access account less than a week after Marcus disappointed savers * Last week Marcus cut its rate to 1.45% ending its year-long reign at the top  * Following that easy access rates fell across the board  * However Al Rayan Bank has now launched a new top easy access rate  There's a new, and unusual, name at the top of the easy access savings tables.  Just one week on from Marcus Bank cutting its market-leading 1.5 per cent rate to 1.45 per cent and other providers following suit, leading to a gloomy outlook facing easy access savers, one bank has launched a rate higher than Marcus's in its prime.  Sharia bank Al Rayan has entered the easy access savings market for the first time, launching an account that pays 1.6 per cent, considerably higher than the next best offers from Cynergy Bank and Marcus.  The account can be opened online, by phone, or in the bank's branches in Birmingham, Bradford, Glasgow, Leicester, London, Luton or Manchester.  It is worth noting that Al Rayan is a Sharia-compliant bank, which means it cannot pay a guaranteed interest rate.  Instead it pays an expected profit rate, which can change the same way a variable interest rate on an easy access account can.  While this is the bank's first foray into the easy access market, it has offered an easy access cash Isa paying 1.35 per cent since April last year.  That rate nestles among the higher-paying easy access Isas in This is Money's tables, but is hardly a best buy and did not suggest the bank would be launching a rate which blew other providers out of the water.  However, in the fixed-rate market Al Rayan and fellow Sharia bank Gatehouse have consistently offered among the best rates. Right now Al Rayan offers the best rate in our tables on one, two and three year fixed-rate deposits, paying 2.07 per cent, 2.32 per cent and 2.42 per cent, respectively.  Given how Marcus helped drag up the rates offered by easy access accounts when it launched a year ago offering 1.5 per cent, there is a possibility Al Rayan has a similar effect if this account sticks around.  Anna Bowes, co-founder of website Savings Champion, said: 'It's an interesting move from a lesser known provider which has offered competitive rates on its fixed term bonds for quite some time now.  'But this is a competitive move into a new part of the market for Al Rayan. It's an excellent rate, especially under the current conditions and will be interesting to see if it causes other providers to up their game.'  Al Rayan allows account holders to deposit up to £1million into its easy access account, but only deposits up to £85,000 will be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\",\n",
       " 'In Brief Schiff Hardin Expands Estate Planning Practice With Ex-UBS Wealth Strategist Schiff Hardin is growing its estate planning practice, adding three attorneys in New York and Chicago, including Stephen Liss, a former UBS strategist who advised high-net-worth families.  Liss joined Schiff Hardin\\'s New York office as a partner in its private clients, trust and estates practice group. The firm also announced Wednesday that Lisa Lukaszewski joined the firm\\'s practice as counsel from Neal, Gerber & Eisenberg while Anna Luna joined as an associate from Ernst & Young. Both will be based in Chicago.  The trio\\'s move comes as Schiff Hardin\\'s revenue has dipped in recent years, according to ALM data. The firm said earlier this year that it was leaning into its trusts and estates practice, as well as other practices that other firms are overlooking.  Liss previously worked as a senior wealth strategist at UBS Financial Services and Barclays. Before that, he was a partner at Withers Bergman.  Schiff Hardin said that during his time in financial services, Liss helped domestic and international high-net-worth clients on income and estate tax planning matters, planned charitable giving and sophisticated life insurance structures.  Liss said that experience will help him as he transitions back into private practice and that he plans to use relationships he\\'s cultivated through his years in financial services to grow his practice.  \"It will be nice to be able to see a project from inception to completion,\" he said in an interview, explaining that while at UBS and Barclays, he was a subjectmatter expert who taught clients about what options were available to them, but did not work with them from start to finish. Now, he hopes to bring his two expertise areas of law and financial planning together at Schiff Hardin.  \"I\\'m excited to use my experience to integrate legal and financial planning and explore how a financial planner can help a client,\" he said.  His decision to join Schiff Hardin was also influenced by relationships he already had with attorneys there.  \"I had worked with their lawyers before, and I had a really good sense of who did quality work based on what they actually produced, compared to who [in the legal industry] just talked about doing good work,\" he said, noting that a number of Schiff Hardin partners were certified by the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel.  \"This has been an important department for [the firm] for a long time,\" he said about Schiff Hardin\\'s private clients, trust and estates practice group. \"They have a really supportive culture. They\\'re just good, decent people, and I knew that coming in.\"  In a statement, Thomas Abendroth, leader of the firm\\'s private clients, trusts and estates practice, complimented Liss\\' combined experience in private practice and working directly with clients and advisers while at UBS.

       " 'Waters Opening Statement at Hearing on Student Loan Debt Crisis; House Financial Services Committee News Release Today, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, gave the following opening statement at a full Committee hearing entitled, \"A $1.5 Trillion Crisis: Protecting Student Borrowers and Holding Student Loan Servicers Accountable.\"  As Prepared for Delivery  Good morning. Today this Committee convenes for a hearing to examine the student loan debt crisis. It appears that this may in fact be the first ever full Committee hearing in this Committee\\'s history focused on student lending and the many financial ramifications it has for student borrowers. Given the scale of the crisis at hand, it is long overdue. I thank Congressman Al Green, Chairman of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, for convening a Subcommittee hearing on this subject earlier this year, and look forward to building on the insights from that hearing during our conversation today.  According to the Federal Reserve, Americans collectively have over $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. That\\'s more than credit card debt, and more than car loan debt, trailing only mortgage debt. More than 44 million people carry student debt averaging almost $33,000. Around 9 million borrowers with federal student loans are currently in default. The burden of student loan debt is preventing young people from saving for retirement, starting small businesses, starting families, and becoming homeowners. This crisis is affecting people across the country, and ultimately it negatively affects our entire economy.  Nevertheless, Trump\\'s Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, has consistently taken actions that are harmful for those with student loans, and the Trump Administration\\'s appointees to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have also undermined key protections. Just last month, the Trump Administration appointed as Student Loan Ombudsman a former executive of a major student loan servicer that is being investigated by several state attorneys general for illegal student loan servicing practices.  I am pleased that we are joined by an outstanding panel of witnesses today, including witnesses who have personally dealt with student loans, have used their positions to raise awareness about the student debt crisis, or who have fought on behalf of consumers against the harmful practices of student loan servicers.  The Education and Labor Committee has an important role to play in this matter, but this Committee does as well, given the need to strengthen protections for student loan borrowers and conduct oversight in the area of student loan servicing. Today we will discuss a series of bills that are designed to help student loan borrowers in a variety of ways. These bills include creating a comprehensive student borrower bill of rights, strengthening credit reporting standards, stopping private debt collectors from going after vulnerable student borrowers, protecting private student loan borrowers, and helping borrowers with student debt purchase their first home. Congress - and this Committee - have a responsibility to take action to ensure student loan borrowers are better protected.

According to Secure Retirement Institute research, just 16% of American workers believe they are saving enough for retirement.

       " 'sport Bury staff missing thousands of pounds from pension pots Tens of thousands of pounds of pensions contributions taken from staff members\\' salaries by Bury Football Club appear to have disappeared, it can be revealed.  The latest development in the financial scandal surrounding Bury, who were expelled from the Football League last week, comes after  police confirmed they have launched a fraud inquiry  into the club.  Two former academy employees at the club have told  The Times  that their pension pots only contain a few pounds despite two years of paying pension contributions. The employer contributions to match the staff contributions have not been paid into their pension funds either. The club has admitted to a pensions deficit of £100,000.  Andy Tower, who was the Bury academy\\'s head of coaching until last week, and the former head academy physio Josh Birtwistle said they believed all the academy and first team staff were in the same boat.  Tower said that he was alerted to the failure to pass on the contributions last year when the former owner Stewart Day was still in charge. No pension contributions have been made since Steve Dale took over the club in December.  Tower said: \"Not only have we not received contributions from the club, but the payments that were taken from our salaries have not been paid in there either. This goes back two years and there is just £5 in my pension fund when there should be more than £2,500.  \"It goes back to the previous regime and lots of people raised it at different times. The club\\'s explanation was always that, \\'We know there\\'s an issue and we are looking into it but the money is there.\\' But if the money is there, where exactly is it?\"  Birtwistle, who is also missing around two years of pension payments, has only £3.63 in his pension fund. He said he had raised an internal complaint earlier this year and eventually had to take time off work due to the stress before leaving the club in May.  He said: \"Eventually I realised I had to get out of there. I had previously worked at Leyton Orient when it had been going through its problems and I saw all the same warning signs. Everyone I knew among the academy staff and the first-team staff are missing contributions.\"  Birtwistle said he sent five emails to Inquesta, the insolvency practitioners supervising the company voluntary arrangement (CVA) which was proposed to cut Bury\\'s debts, before receiving a response that it would take six to eight weeks for it to investigate.  The pension issue was admitted by Inquesta\\'s Steven Wiseglass in his CVA proposal to creditors on June 21.  He said that \"No payments have been made into the [pension] scheme for a significant period of time\" and that \"the club has estimated it to be a deficit of £100,000\".

The new practice means tenants with animals are being charged up to £50 a month additional rent for a single pet, adding considerably to the cost of housing at a time when more and more families are priced out of buying and rely on rented homes.  One landlord in Bicester in Oxfordshire is asking £40 per pet in monthly rent in a two-bedroom home that already costs £995 a month for the human occupants. It means a family with a dog and two cats would face a yearly animal rent of over £1,400. Another in Cheltenham is asking £50 a month for \"four-legged friends\" with exemptions for fish or hamsters. Several landlords are seeking pet rent only for \"clawed\" pets.  \"In certain letting agencies it seems to be a standard term in agreements,\" said Darren Baxter, a renter currently searching for a new home in York with his partner, two children and cocker spaniel Padfoot. \"It seems exorbitant given the potential damage a pet can cause. We went to one place where they wanted a reference for the dog. That was ridiculous.\"  He said it was another example of how people who cannot afford to buy are disadvantaged in terms of being able to enjoy some of the basics of family life.  One letting agent said the new practice had only emerged since June, when landlords were banned from charging cleaning fees at the end of a tenancy or demanding an additional pet deposit as a result of total deposits being capped at five weeks\\' rent.  Before the Tenant Fees Act 2019, which was supposed to save renters across England £240m a year, landlords often asked for pet deposits of around £150, repayable at the end of the tenancy. Pet rents now mean they have no choice but to pay more.  \"The only way to do it is to charge higher rent,\" said Karolina Misiukiewicz, administrator at Elliot Oliver, an estate agent in Cheltenham. \"It\\'s a new thing for us. In our experience we haven\\'t taken extra for hamsters or gerbils and definitely not fish.\"  Dozens of adverts for homes demanding pet rent can be seen on the rental websites Rightmove and Zoopla, along with many more refusing to take pets.  Half of UK adults own a pet, with 11 million owning cats and almost 9 million owning dogs, according to the veterinary charity PDSA. At the same time more and more families are having to rent. A quarter of families in England rent privately, reaching nearly 1.6m last year, more than double the number recorded in the government\\'s English Housing Survey a decade earlier.',\n",
       " 'News Advice fees vary by 1,000 per cent New research highlights significant divergence in fee structures  Adviser fees for retirement advice can vary by up to 1,000 per cent, new research has found, at the same time as an expert revealed other charging models are starting to gain traction.  A survey conducted by consumer champion Which? asked 108 advisers how much they would charge for advice in three different scenarios, and the results revealed a vast degree of disparity.  In the first scenario, advisers were asked to quote costs for someone approaching retirement, and aiming to start drawing an income, with £100,000 in savings, £150,000 in a pension, and £100,000 in an investment Isa.  The maximum quote from intermediaries was £5,000, 10 times more expensive than the lowest (£500).  Other examples revealed a similar trend. Scenario three described a client with no mortgage and \"comfortable\" savings, with a £100,000 inheritance to invest. Results again were wide-ranging, with the maximum fee at £3,000, the minimum once again at £500, and the average £1,980.  Scenario two took a difference stance, as the individual expressed a need to start saving for a child\\'s education, instead of looking for advice on lump sums. But a vast disparity in fees was still evident. The cheapest, at £300, was still £2,200 lower than the most expensive.  Advice costs have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with the Financial Conduct Authority stepping in after finding that some models present a risk to consumers in certain areas of advice.  The regulator\\'s recent proposal to ban contingent charging for defined benefit to defined contribution transfers is a case in point.  Anecdotally at least, changes are occurring in the way intermediaries charge for advice. In an article responding to the FCA\\'s proposed contingent charging ban, Abbie Knight, founder of Discus, said that over recent years there had been a notable increase in advisers moving towards a \"menu-forservice\" model.  This involves time-costing each piece of work and applying an appropriate profit margin. The fee can then be adjusted for cases that require additional resource due to time or complexity.  Ms Knight said: \"This menubased charging approach is built on the premise that the process and steps involved in delivering each service remains the same, irrespective of the size of the investment.  \"The menu model ensures clients only pay for the service they receive - a stark contrast to the traditional percentagebased charging model.\" A further issue of relevance to advisory fees has been the number of consumers feeling priced out of advice, resulting in the much-publicised advice gap. The FCA is revisiting this area via its analysis of the Retail Distribution Review and the Financial Advice Market Review, but its assessments are not due to be published until next summer. craig.rickman@ft.com  \\'The menu model ensures clients only pay for the service they receive - a stark contrast to the traditional percentagebased charging model\\'',\n",
       " 'Money PPI claims: consumers hit by online and phone problems as deadline looms Santander apologises for IT glitch and other banks report long call-waiting times  Consumers making last-minute claims for mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) have had to deal with crashing websites and jammed phone lines as banks struggled to cope with an 11th-hour surge in complaints.  While the final deadline for making a claim is 11.59pm on Thursday 29 August, the problems prompted the Financial Conduct Authority to say that \"where a firm knows that customers may have had trouble accessing their services (whether website or phone) ? then we would expect them to apply a pragmatic approach to dealing with complaints received immediately after the deadline\".  Several banks have had problems with their websites, with some potential applicants being confronted with \"internal server error\" messages. The glitches were blamed on exceptionally high web traffic.  Santander apologised for \"a brief technical issue earlier this morning [29 August]\", which meant customers were unable to access its online PPI claim form. The bank said: \"This has now been resolved and we\\'re sorry for the inconvenience caused to customers.\" Nevertheless, some people have continued to report problems with the bank\\'s website.  The Co-operative Bank said its online PPI form was \"intermittently unavailable between 1.15pm and 2.45pm due to a technical issue\". It added it was continuing to monitor the availability of the form.  At NatWest, some potential complainants who clicked on its PPI complaint form were greeted by a message saying: \"Due to system problems, we are unable to progress your application at present ? Please try again later.\"  Meanwhile, customers of several banks have reported long waiting times to get through on the phone.  On Twitter, one customer asked Royal Bank of Scotland: \"why can\\'t I get through to your PPI line????????? Says busy kept trying! Ongoing claim....not good enough!\"  Another asked RBS : \"Why isn\\'t PPI number working!!!! #Dodgy.\"  The bank replied: \"This is due to the high call volumes. Please try again later ?\"  Martin Lewis, founder of the MoneySavingExpert website, had warned that some websites could crash and said consumers unable to make a claim because of technical problems must be given time to do so.  He said: \"As predicted, there is unprecedented last-minute demand for reclaiming PPI ? And that huge demand is causing even major bank systems to creak and struggle.  \"The obvious first advice is to take time, be prepared and be patient. However, it is simply not fair or right that people who have tried to submit a claim before the deadline and have been disenfranchised by bust bank tech miss out.\"  PPI is Britain\\'s costliest consumer scandal, with £36bn paid out by UK banks to compensate people who bought often-worthless insurance cover, thinking it would help them repay debts in the event of sickness or unemployment. The average payout has been about £2,000. Of the total, £340m was paid out in June alone.',\n",

       " 'News Armed Forces caught in pensions tax trap Senior personnel face hefty bills as they are hit by reforms aimed at squeezing top earners  Political CORRESPONDENT THOUSANDS of members of the UK Armed Forces have been trapped by a government pension reform aimed at restricting tax breaks for high earners. Some senior services personnel are even rejecting promotions rather than face a financial loss as a result of the pension rules, said Tobias Ellwood, the former defence minister.  In 2017-18, 3,840 members of the Armed Forces breached their annual tax-free pensions savings limit, exposing them to hefty tax bills. This was a near-quadrupling of the 1,010 breaches recorded in 2015-16.  Earlier this month the Treasury said it would review the controversial rules introduced by George Osborne, the former chancellor, which restricts higher earners from putting more than £10,000 annually into their pension pot without facing taxes.  The standard allowance allows people to save £40,000 before the charges apply, but the threshold can fall to as low as £10,000 for those with incomes of more than £110,000.  The figures come as the Government is trying to stem a staffing crisis in the NHS involving doctors reducing their hours to avoid tax bills for breaches of their annual pension allowance.  Mr Ellwood said: \"I know good people who have chosen to avoid getting their third star because they are lured by jobs in Civvy Street but also put off by what their new pensions contribution will be.  \"Ultimately, the absence of realterms increase in defence spending will mean that issues such as this will not be addressed. The reason why people leave the Armed Forces, why retention is difficult, is because of what they\\'re doing off the battlefield - the welfare side and pay.\"  Official Government figures showed that recruitment is increasing but the Army, with 74,400 regular fullytrained troops, is more than 7,000 short of the target figure of 82,000 - a deficit of almost 10 per cent.  Mr Ellwood said if the issue was going to be sorted out it had to be \"right across the board for police and for doctors as well as everybody who moves into a pay bracket, which means that they trip this pensions contribution\".  Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, previously wrote in The Daily Telegraph that a \"major overhaul\" would allow senior doctors in England and Wales to \"take on additional NHS work and be fairly rewarded for it without the worry of an unexpected tax bill\". Major General Neil Marshall, chief executive of the Forces Pension Society, told the Financial Times: \"This is by no means restricted to the most senior officers or defence medical service personnel only.  \"Our research suggests that around 10 per cent of those affected are from the non-commissioned ranks.\"  He added: \"The potential impact of the pension tax is rapidly becoming a key factor many service personnel consider when deciding their future commitment to the Armed Forces.\"',\n",

The bodies of the two teens were found Aug. 7 in northern Manitoba. They died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds.  In an Aug. 21 email to Alan Schmegelsky\\'s lawyer, the RCMP acknowledge the existence of a video in which Bryer Schmegelsky describes what he wants to happen to his body after his death.  The RCMP say the video has been released to Bryer Schmegelsky\\'s mother as his next of kin, and they will not be sharing the video with his father.  The email also says police plan to release information about the video to media in the next couple of weeks, and ask that this information be kept private.  Alan Schmegelsky\\'s lawyer, Sarah Leamon, said he wants access to the video in order to find closure after his son\\'s death.  \"Like any father, my client is just seeking to have access to his son\\'s last will and testament so that he can get some final closure on the situation,\" Leamon said. \"He\\'s been unable to do that without access to the video.\"  Leamon said she is keeping all options open to obtain access to the video for Schmegelsky.  The RCMP did not respond to requests for comment.  Bryer Schmegelsky and McLeod were charged in the death of 64-year-old Leonard Dyck, whose body was found July 19 two kilometres from the pair\\'s burned-out pickup truck near Dease Lake.  The pair are also suspects in the deaths of 24-year-old American Chynna Deese and 23-year-old Australian Lucas Fowler. The couple were found July 15 on the side of the Alaska Highway, near Liard Hot Springs. They had been shot and killed.  Schmegelsky and McLeod were initially considered missing, but RCMP later announced they were suspects in the three homicides.  The search for the two Port Alberni men spread from northern B.C. to Gillam, Man., where their bodies were found in dense brush on Aug. 7.  RCMP said the two had been dead for a number of days before their bodies were found, but the exact date of their deaths is not known. They were found about eight kilometres from a burnedout Toyota Rav4 belonging to Dyck.  Two firearms were found with the bodies, and a forensic analysis is underway to determine whether the weapons are connected with the three homicides. regan-elliott@timescolonist.com  Laura Kane, The Canadian Press / Alan Schmegelsky, father of Bryer Schmegelsky, in Mill Bay.; Laura Kane, The Canadian Press / Alan Schmegelsky, father of Bryer Schmegelsky, in Mill Bay.

       " \"Jeffrey Epstein signed a will two days before his death Washington DC, Aug 19 (EFE).- Multi-millionaire financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, who committed suicide in prison earlier this month, signed his will two days before his death, according to court documents.  Epstein's lawyers filed the will - which valued Epstein's estate at $577.6 million - in the United States Virgin Islands, according to the New York Post daily, which was the first to report the news of the will on Monday.  Details of the beneficiaries are not included in the document, which groups all of Epstein's assets into a trust called The 1953 Trust.  In the absence of a will, Epstein's only brother, Mark, was presumed to be his heir.  Epstein's properties include two islands located in the US Virgin Islands: Little St James, valued at $63 million, and Great St James, valued at $22 million.  Epstein had a mansion on the Little St James island, which the FBI raided after his death and where he allegedly organized parties and orgies with minors.  Epstein's properties also included a townhouse in New York City - one of the largest private homes in Manhattan, valued at $55.9 million - a ranch in New Mexico ($17.2 million), a mansion in Palm Beach ($12.4 million) and an apartment in Paris ($8.7 million).  The will also lists $56.5 million in cash, $112 million in stocks and bonds, another $14 million in fixed-income investments, as well as luxury cars, airplanes and boats worth $18.5 million.  The lawyers of Epstein's alleged victims have asked the government to confiscate his properties to pay damages to the victims as the trial against him can no longer be held.  Epstein was arrested on July 6 after landing in New Jersey on his private jet and was subsequently charged with sex trafficking of minors crimes similar to those he faced over a decade ago in Florida. On that occasion, he ended up evading severe punishment after reaching a very advantageous deal with federal prosecutors.  The prosecution team was headed by ex-Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who was recently forced to resign from his cabinet post in the Trump administration after The Miami Herald published an in-depth investigation into Epstein's extraordinarily lenient plea deal.  Epstein was being held without bail inside a federal prison in New York City while awaiting trial.  Following a failed suicide attempt on July 23, he finally killed himself on Aug. 10.  Although the coroner confirmed suicide as the cause of death, the fact that Epstein was not under surveillance after the first attempt has given rise to multiple conspiracy theories given his friendships with high-profile figures such as US Presidents Donald Trump and Bill Clinton or the United Kingdom's Prince Andrew.  Days after his suicide, the warden of the jail where Epstein was being held, Shirley Skipper-Scott, was removed and two staff members were placed on administrative leave. EFE  at/pd/dl\",\n",
       " 'Raise state pension age to 75 and boost \\'employee-tailored\\' mid-life MOTs, says think-tank The Centre for Social Justice is calling for the state pension age to be raised to 70 by 2028 and to 75 by 2035, a much faster rise than currently planned.  Former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith\\'s think-tank has proposed the acceleration would be aided by \"improvements to workplace support and healthcare\" for older employees.  The government\\'s current legal schedule anticipates the state pension age rising to 67 by 2028, and then to 68 between 2044 and 2046, although law is expected to be enacted to make the latter happen by 2039.  The report - published yesterday (18 August) - suggests that without increasing in opportunities for older workers, individuals, businesses and the economy will suffer.  It also suggests raising the state pension age to 75 could boost the UK gross domestic product by more than £180bn and increase the demand for goods and services as household incomes would be significantly higher.  Additionally the paper argues the mid-life MOT, suggested by John Cridland in his independent review of the state pension age, \"currently fails to be a holistic tool and is ill-suited to initiate a meaningful conversation between employers and employees\".  It recommends employee-tailored, holistic mid-life MOTs should be implemented by employers to discuss wealth, work and health. The report notes this should include discussion about opportunities for flexibility, workplace adjustments and training opportunities.  Rather than being understood as retirement support, this structure should be \"conceptualised as a support tool\" for older workers to enable those that want to, to continue work.  A number of providers, including Aviva and Legal & General, have rolled out mid-life MOTs, while the government has launched a website dedicated to the idea. However, a House of Lords committee has also said \"a good deal more thought\" is needed as the schemes are in danger of \"missing those most in need of support\".  Royal London pensions specialist Helen Morrissey said: \"While such proposals will undoubtedly save money, raising the state pension age so quickly will cause huge issues for many retirees who will not have been given adequate time to prepare.  \"We need to give careful thought to what kind of jobs people in their 70s are able to do and, while some people will be able to work on for longer, others simply won\\'t be able to. These people will face severe financial hardship if they have not saved enough into a pension to cover the years between leaving work and claiming state pension. The government needs to think carefully before taking such drastic action.\"  Prolonging working life could also boost savings for those in part-time work or in the gig economy, the think-tank said. It also suggests workers could transition from full-time to part-time work over a longer period of time in order to balance caring responsibilities or manage a health condition.

       " 'Business US mortgage debt hits record US mortgage debt reached a record in the second quarter, exceeding its 2008 peak as the global financial crisis unfolded.  Mortgage balances rose by $US162 billion in the second quarter to $US9.406 trillion ($13.8 trillion), surpassing the high of $US9.294 trillion in the third quarter of 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said on Tuesday.  Mortgages are the largest component of household debt. Mortgage originations, which include refinancings, increased by $US130bn to $US474bn in the second quarter. The figures are nominal, meaning they aren\\'t adjusted for inflation.  \"The big picture is that when you look at mortgages, which is the biggest piece of [household debt], it still looks pretty healthy,\" said Michael Feroli, chief US economist at JPMorgan Chase, noting that while household debt had grown, so had incomes.  The milestone for mortgage debt has been long in the making. Americans\\' mortgage debt dropped by about 15 per cent from the 2008 peak to the trough in the second quarter of 2013 and has climbed slowly since then.  Total household debt has been on the rise since mid-2013. It rose by 1.4 per cent from the first quarter to $US13.86 trillion.  Still, the household debt picture is much different in 2019 than it was 11 years ago, since lending standards are tighter and less debt is delinquent today.  The second quarter saw a steep drop in the 30-year mortgage rate, which boosted borrowers\\' incentive to take out a mortgage or refinance. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropped below 4 per cent in May for the first time since early last year.  \"What\\'s more interesting is when you look at the service burden, we don\\'t have more debt,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.  Still, the housing market has been crimped by low inventory and high prices. Home prices hit a new nominal peak in September 2016 and have continued to climb since then.  Alongside higher home prices, a factor behind rising mortgage debt balances in the second quarter could be homeowners tapping into home equity for cash when they refinance.  Refinancing accounted for about half of new mortgages in the second quarter, according to Guy Cecala, chief executive at Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry research group. That represents a \"mini refinancing boom\" since the refinancing share of new mortgages was about 30 per cent in 2018, when rates were rising, Mr Cecala said.  Borrowers who refinanced in the second quarter and chose the option to cash out withdrew an estimated $US17.5bn in equity out of their homes, according to Freddie Mac, a mortgage-finance company. While that was $US2.1bn higher than the second quarter of last year, it remains well below the prerecession peak of $US84bn cashed out in the second quarter of 2006.  Despite the higher debt loads, Americans appear to be keeping up with payments, with 95.6 per cent of balances current.',\n",

After failing to comply with the order and confirming that it would not take any further part in the litigation, Berkeley Burke\\'s defences in the group proceedings have been struck out and claimants are permitted to enter judgement.  As a group, claimants embarked on legal proceedings against Berkeley Burke when they lost money after investing in unregulated investments through its SIPPs.  Financial services barrister John Virgo represented the claimants throughout the proceedings and secured the court order, which has directed the SIPP provider to pay almost £1m as an interim payment on account of the claimants\\' costs, as well as the cost of the claimants\\' application.  According to court documents seen by RP\\'s sister publication Professional Adviser, Berkeley Burke must pay nearly £4,000 for the claimants\\' costs associated with the court application in May, a further £10,000 for claimants\\' costs associated with a July application and an interim payment of nearly £1m on account of the claimants\\' costs for the legal proceedings.  On the SIPP provider\\'s failure to comply with the court order, Clarke Willmott senior associate Laura Robinson said: \"An advised defendant in court proceedings will almost certainly have appreciated what the consequences would be for openly and deliberately disengaging in the litigation, including the severe financial consequences that would result.\"  Addressing the possibility the firm risked falling into insolvency as a result of the costs it had been order to pay, Robinson said: \"One possible explanation, where a defendant chooses this course of action, is that it simply cannot fund the proceedings any further.  \"I cannot know, but if that were Berkeley Burke\\'s situation, it\\'s possible that the firm may slip into insolvency in light of the £1m costs order it now faces.  \"Were this to happen, it seems likely the industry would pick up the bill and hundreds of those who lost out would be restricted to the compensation available from the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.\"  PA has contacted Berkeley Burke for comment.  Berkeley Burke v FOS  Earlier this year Berkeley Burke was granted permission to appeal the judgement delivered against it in October last year, which saw the High Court reject the SIPP provider\\'s claim against a Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) decision.  In the original decision, the ombudsman ruled the SIPP administrator had to compensate a client after it failed to carry out appropriate due diligence on their investment.  Berkeley Burke, which facilitated the investment, argued it carried out the due diligence expected of it at the time, according to Conduct of Business Sourcebook (COBS) rules, and that the FOS subsequently placed undue responsibility by applying FCA Principles 2 and 6 in a way that created a new and unexpected duty of care on the part of SIPP operators.',\n",

Even after you buy the right sunscreen, you still have to be diligent about applying it regularly and practicing safe behavior while in the sun. The World Health Organization notes that you should apply sunscreen \"liberally\" and re-apply every two hours, or after working, swimming, playing or exercising outdoors.\"  But most people don\\'t do this: The American Academy of Dermatology says that \"most people only apply 25%-50% of the recommended amount of sunscreen.\" You should be applying enough to cover all your exposed skin. \"Most adults need about 1 ounce - or enough to fill a shot glass - to fully cover their body,\" the AAD recommends. (Studies show that it only takes a handful of sunburns to dramatically increase you risk of skin cancer.) And be sure to apply it to dry skin at least 15 minutes before going outside.  Other sun rules from WHO include limiting your time in the sun, particularly between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun is strongest; looking for shade when you can (though note that even umbrellas and trees won\\'t completely cover you); and wearing protective clothing.',\n",

       " 'Money,News Money NOT ASDA PRICE Thousands of Asda workers must sign contracts cutting holiday allowances and paid breaks or face the sack THOUSANDS of Asda workers could \"face the sack\" unless they agree to contracts that cut holiday allowance and scrap paid breaks.  One furious supermarket worker claims some staff will be £500 a year worse off under the new arrangements as well as losing eight days\\' annual leave through loss of bank holidays, according to the Daily Record.  The revised terms of employment are part of the grocer\\'s so-called \\'flexible\\' Contract 6 that is being enforced across the board. Bank holidays will reportedly be made compulsory under the new agreement while paid breaks will be stopped.  The document seen by the Daily Record goes on to reveal how Asda is ready to terminate the contracts of those who are unwilling to sign onto the new changes.  It says employees will have meetings with their managers to discuss the new contract.  The document goes on to say: \"If you still don\\'t want to sign up to the new contract after those 121s, at that stage, we would issue notice to terminate your employment on your existing terms and conditions.  \"We will offer to re-engage you on the new terms.  \"If you choose not to accept the new terms, you would leave the business.\"  It is understood the GMB, which represents Asda employees, will protest with workers over the demands on August 14.  Asda told The Sun the contract changes were the result of a consultation process, first started in April, and the new terms will see the base rate of pay for workers go up to £9 per hour.  But it admitted five per cent of workers will be worse off and said a transitional payment for 18 months will be paid to employees missing out.  The supermarket also noted 50,000 colleagues nationwide were already employed on this contract before the consultation.  Asda said: \"This new contract will see Asda invest in a pay increase for over 100,000 retail colleagues, as well as enabling us to deliver better service to our customers in an intensely competitive marketplace.  \"We are continuing to talk to our colleagues about this change and to understand what it might mean for their individual circumstances.\"  Gary Carter, GMB National Office, told the Daily Record he wants Asda to come back to the negotiating table to give \"this dedicated workforce a fair deal\".  Last month Asda and Sainsbury\\'s merger was put on ice for the foreseeable future as the Competition and Markets Authority said they cannot join forces for at least 10 years.  The CMA had blocked the planned merger in April, saying it was more likely to lead to price rises rather than cuts.  There were fears it could spark the sale of almost 500 supermarkets.

       " 'Cash-flow data can predict creditworthiness, new study shows The use of cash-flow data - the money flowing in and out of customer accounts every month - may be useful in predicting creditworthiness, according to a study released Thursday.  FinRegLab, a nonprofit that tests new technologies to foster an \"inclusive financial marketplace\" analyzed the data of six nonbank lenders that use cash-flow data in their underwriting: Accion, Brigit, Kabbage, LendUp, Oportun and Petal.  While acknowledging the limitations of their analysis to date, including that the study doesn\\'t reflect the full U.S. population and range of financial services products available, the nonprofit found encouraging indications that cash-flow analysis can be used as a predictor of creditworthiness on its own and in combination with credit scores.  The study gives nonbank lenders like Kabbage and Upstart additional ammunition in their efforts to prove that alternative data can be a better judge of creditworthiness than the traditional model that relies on credit bureau information and FICO scores. FinRegLab, which is the first to do an independent study on the idea, found that the use of cash-flow predicts loan performance, helps provide access to credit to borrowers who ordinarily wouldn\\'t be eligible for it (for instance, if they had no credit bureau file), and appears to meet the requirements of fair-lending rules.  \"This is an encouraging set of results and it makes us think that it is worth investing some time and effort to keep going in this area,\" said Kelly Cochran, deputy director at FinRegLab.  Cash-flow data is not as exotic as some other types of alternative data, such as education information.  \"This is really going to core financial stability and financial habits, the kinds of things that underwriters have always looked at in lending,\" Cochran said. \"So it\\'s much closer to the traditional questions even if it\\'s using a slightly different data source to answer them.\"  Some bankers are loath to change the underwriting process they\\'ve used for decades, due in part to fears about regulatory compliance. Studies like FinRegLab\\'s could help provide comfort both for regulators and financial institution executives.  \"We talk to a lot of different financial firms and bank and nonbank lenders, and there are lots of arguments made for trying out new data or trying out new methods for underwriting,\" said Melissa Koide, founder and CEO of FinRegLab. \"But when you\\'re sitting on the government side, what you really want to know and have are fact-based insights to help then empirically evaluate the benefits and risks associated with new types of data. We undertook this research to generate those independent fact-based analyses so that regulators, policymakers and the banking and fintech industry have more facts to then think about where there may be opportunities and value of evolving regulations.\"  Koide noted that even with confidence about the use of cash-flow data, regulators and bankers still have to grapple with questions about data sharing and consumer consent.',\n",

Bitcoin IRA (Individual Retirement Account) is a personal financial plan that provides investors with a secure method of investing in the crypto asset market. Apart from regular sources of investment like stocks and bonds, many investors have realized the potential of investing in alternative assets like precious metals, artwork, cryptocurrency, gems, and coins. Most advisors recommend a range of 6 to 25 percent of a client's portfolio to be within alternative assets. However, like any other investment, a Bitcoin IRA can come under risk so it becomes important for the investor to perform thorough research before making a decision. Bitcoin is subject to capital gains taxes when sold at a profit so holding them within a tax-advantaged retirement account is ideal.  The 4 Step Bitcoin IRA rollover process is as follows:  * Fill out an account setup form  * Speak with a customer service representative  * Fund your account  * Put your wallet in Cold Storage  Smart Bitcoin Investments also provides information on how to secure a wallet and recommends the best cryptocurrency IRA companies to invest with.

       " 'Business Simple errors lead to IHT Your Money  THOUSANDS of families are paying unnecessary inheritance tax (IHT) bills by making simple financial planning errors, such as failing to complete forms and neglecting tax-free allowances.  This is costing families dear as the average IHT bill hit £200,000 last year, up from just £141,000 five years earlier, generating a record £5.4 billion in tax revenues for HM Revenue & Customs.  Bills could increase substantially if Jeremy Corbyn\\'s Labour Party takes power, as it is lining up a tough new tax regime that could triple the IHT take to an incredible £15 billion.  It therefore pays to start planning your financial legacy as soon as you can, to avoid getting caught in the net.  TAKEN ON TRUST IHT is currently charged at 40 per cent on assets above £325,000, although married couples can double this to £650,000.  The main residence threshold can lift this to £950,000 for couples who pass on their family home to children and grandchildren.  While this is enough for most families, planning is essential as many unnecessarily pay IHT on their life insurance policies, after failing to write them \"in trust\".  NFU Mutual chartered financial planner Sean McCann said to contact your insurer and complete a simple trust form to remove the threat: \"Policy proceeds will go directly to your beneficiaries rather than your estate and will not be taken into account when IHT is calculated.\"  Money held inside a pension is free of IHT but many are losing this protection by making early pension withdrawals. McCann said: \"They are taking it out of a protective wrapper that shields it from income tax, capital gains tax and, crucially, IHT.\"  He suggested taking money from Isas or other investments before dipping into the most tax-efficient of all your assets.  TAXING QUESTION SteveWebb, director of policy at insurer Royal London, said parents and grandparents could cut their IHT exposure by contributing to their children or grandchildren\\'s pension.  A little-known pensions feature allows children to claim tax relief on parental contributions to a pension: \"This may also reduce future IHT bills if they qualify for one of the standard exemptions such as regular gifts made from normal income.\"  Individuals can also gift up to £3,000 each year, free of IHT, and mop up any unused allowance from last year. Couples who did not use last year\\'s allowance could give £12,000.  They can give further gifts to family on marriage and smaller gifts of up to £250 to as many people as they like, so long as they have not benefited from another IHT allowance.  Gifts above that only become fully exempt from IHT if you live for seven years.  The urgency of planning has been increased by Labour\\'s proposals to scrap the family home allowance altogether and replace IHT with a new \"lifetime gifts tax\", which could see married couples lose tax breaks worth an incredible £875,000 in total.',\n",
       " 'Money,News Money TOY JOY Toys R Us \\'to re-open in time for Christmas\\' - but only in the US COLLAPSED retail chain Toys R Us could be reopened by Christmas - but only in the US, reports claim.  The iconic kids\\' toy store went bust at the beginning of 2018 after attempts to sell the struggling firm failed.  Bloomberg  reports that Tru Kids - the brand behind Toys R Us - are planning on opening 12 stores across America before the year is out.  It\\'s believed that Richard Barry, former executive at the retailer, is going to pitch the plans, which includes an online store, at an industry conference later this week.  It\\'s not clear whether there are any plans to reopen the UK side of the business, or whether the online shop will offer international shipping.  Sources told the news outlet that the new stores in the US will be roughly 10,000-square feet which is about a third of the size of the retailer\\'s warehouses that it was known for.  Why did Toys R Us close in the UK?  TOYS R Us was put into administration after attempts to sell the business failed and some stores could shut in within days.  More than 3,000 jobs were put at risk as it was revealed store closures would take place among ALL its outlets nationwide.  An \"orderly wind-down of the company\\'s store portfolio\" followed.  On March 2, 2018, Moorfields Advisory, the firm in charge of the closure of the retail chain, confirmed it was commencing a nationwide closing down sale at all stores.  Now, there are no Toys R Us stores open in the UK.  There will also be play areas for children to explore while their parents shop.  A spokesperson for Tru Kids told Bloomberg that the company isn\\'t ready to make the plans public yet.  Earlier this month, the brand relaunched in Australia by selling good through Hobby Warehouse websites.  Seventy years after it first launched, Toys \\'R\\' Us went bust in the US at the end of 2017 and by February 2018 the UK side of the retailer collapsed too.  It meant that 106 stores closed across the country leaving 3,000 staff without a job.  Since its demise, supermarkets have rushed in to plug the gap such as Tesco and Asda who regularly run toy sales.  Competitor Smyths Toys Store is still operating 110 stores across the UK and Ireland, while shoppers have also been able to bag discounts on playthings at Home Bargains and B&M.  A mum recently revealed to The Sun how she makes £500 a month by selling her old kids\\' toys on eBay .

Sources told the news outlet that the new stores in the US will be roughly 10,000-square feet which is about a third of the size of the retailer\\'s warehouses that it was known for.  Why did Toys R Us close in the UK?  TOYS R Us was put into administration after attempts to sell the business failed and some stores could shut in within days.  More than 3,000 jobs were put at risk as it was revealed store closures would take place among ALL its outlets nationwide.  An \"orderly wind-down of the company\\'s store portfolio\" followed.  On March 2, 2018, Moorfields Advisory, the firm in charge of the closure of the retail chain, confirmed it was commencing a nationwide closing down sale at all stores.  Now, there are no Toys R Us stores open in the UK.  There will also be play areas for children to explore while their parents shop.  A spokesperson for Tru Kids told Bloomberg that the company isn\\'t ready to make the plans public yet.  Earlier this month, the brand relaunched in Australia by selling good through Hobby Warehouse websites.  Seventy years after it first launched, Toys \\'R\\' Us went bust in the US at the end of 2017 and by February 2018 the UK side of the retailer collapsed too.  It meant that 106 stores closed across the country leaving 3,000 staff without a job.  Since its demise, supermarkets have rushed in to plug the gap such as Tesco and Asda who regularly run toy sales.  Competitor Smyths Toys Store is still operating 110 stores across the UK and Ireland, while shoppers have also been able to bag discounts on playthings at Home Bargains and B&M.  A mum recently revealed to The Sun how she makes £500 a month by selling her old kids\\' toys on eBay.  Mothercare is currently running an up to 50 per cent off sale with baby and toddler clothes starting from £1.50.  The Sun has contacted Tru Kids for comment.  We pay for your stories!

But that\\'s doesn\\'t make it an easy path toward becoming rich.  Just over 49,000 single-family homes and condos were flipped in the first quarter of 2019, according to a recent report by real-estate data firm Attom Data Solutions. These homes comprised 7.2% of all home sales nationwide during that time period, representing the highest home-flipping rate since the first quarter of 2010.  But that\\'s not necessarily a positive indicator of the housing market\\'s strength, said Todd Teta, Attom\\'s chief product officer. The number of homes that were flipped was actually down 8% from the previous year to a three-year low. And the number of investors engaging in home flipping has dropped 11% over the past year.  In the first quarter, homes flipped sold for a median price of $215,000. With the median purchase price standing at $155,000, the gross flipping profit was just $60,000, down $8,000 from a year earlier to a three-year low.  Also see: Why Americans are holding off on remodeling their homes (for now)  \"While the home flipping rate is increasing, gross profits and ROI are starting to weaken,\" Teta said in the report. \"If investors are seeing profit margins drop, they may be acting now and selling before price increases drop even more.\"  Researchers previously described home-flipping activity as a \"canary in the coal mine\" that could presage a cooling housing market.  In the first quarter, the home-flipping rate was up year-over-year in 62% of markets nationwide, suggesting that this sentiment could be widespread and not just concentrated in overheated housing markets across the West Coast.  Despite the seemingly turning tides in the home-flipping market, one bright spot is the renewed interest that so-called \\'iBuyers,\" tech firms that use algorithms to make instant home offers, have taken in the businesses.

The new initiative will freeze interest payments for people in severe debt, and halt enforcement action from creditors for two months.  This will include council tax arrears, personal tax debts and benefit overpayments.  It will give individuals and families struggling with their finances extra help and time to get their bills and payments under control.  The scheme will be enforced in 2021 and will see payments frozen - along with action from bailiffs - for 60 days.  The government said that individuals receiving NHS treatment for mental health reasons will not need to seek debt advice during the 60-day period.  850,000 people have had a bad experience with a bailiff - with forced entries top of the list  They will continue to receive the same Breathing Space protections, which will last for the whole of their treatment.  City minister, John Glen, said: \"Problem debt can have a devastating impact of people\\'s lives, putting a huge burden on individuals which can lead to family breakdown, stress and mental health issues.  \"No one should be stuck in an endless cycle of debt and facing the ever-looming threat of invasive debt collectors.  \"That\\'s why I\\'m introducing this new scheme, giving everyone access to the advice, time and support they need to both get their finances under control and get away from the perpetual stress and worry debt can cause.\"  Helen Undy, of the Money and Mental Health Policy Institute, said: \"This scheme could genuinely save lives. Everyone experiencing a mental health crisis should have the opportunity to recover free from escalating debt fees, charges and the threat of bailiffs arriving at their door.  \"We are delighted that the government acted on our call to protect people from being hassled about debts while they\\'re receiving crisis care, and we look forward to working with ministers to put these plans in place over the coming year.\"  Joanna Elson OBE, of the Money Advice Trust, the charity that runs National Debtline, added: \"Breathing Space will provide a powerful incentive for people to seek debt advice, safe in the knowledge they will be given the time and statutory protections they need to begin to resolve their financial difficulty.  \"The decision to include local authorities and other public sector creditors is particularly welcome - and means this new scheme could well be a game-changer in our efforts to tackle problem debt as a society.  \"We look forward to working with government and other partners to ensure that Breathing Space is implemented successfully, and to continue to contribute to the government\\'s plans for Statutory Debt Repayment Plans as these are developed further.\"  Pay off your debts',\n",
       " 'FED:Asian airline wants cheap travel redefined ADaniel McCulloch  PARIS, June 18 AAP - Australian travellers are being challenged to rethink their attitudes towards low-cost airlines.  Cheap doesn\\'t need to mean nasty, argues AirAsia X chief executive NaddaBuranasiri.  The carrier has just picked up its 11th consecutive gong as the world\\'s best low cost airline.  Driving through Paris after pocketing the consumer award at an international air show, Mr Buranasiri was mindful of changing Australian perceptions of low-cost providers.  \"The cheap has to still be there,\" he told AAP in the French capital on Tuesday.  \"But when you say cheap, it comes with the expectation that it?s not going to be that great.  \"We want to call ourselves value for money, and that?s the important thing that we are trying to do, especially in Australia.\"  Australians are beginning to warm to AirAsia\\'s base rates, with 60 flights in and out of the country each week.  But its additional costs - for luggage, preferred seating, meals and entertainment - are a pet peeve among many holiday-makers.  MrBuranasiri is leaving the door open to reshaping this add-on model in time.  \"When you start having a mindset that what we are already doing is working then it stops your ability to improve,\" he told AAP.  \"If one day the business model needs to be revised or re-looked at, then we will not say to ourselves that it is not possible.\"  Industry insiders also point to nagging problems with AirAsia\\'s levels of service when connections go awry and cancellations occur.  In response, the airline has rebadged its customer care department to be \"customer happiness\".  It is also investing heavily in artificial intelligence in an attempt to gain more control over the problems.  A virtual agent called Ava will soon be tasked with handling general inquiries, checking flights and processing refunds.  \"We still have the chat room and call centre but she is learning every day,\"Mr Buranasiri said.  \"Maybe we are getting there sooner than we think, in terms of making it a better experience.\"  AirAsia is dipping its toe deeper into the Australian market with direct flights between Brisbane and Bangkok starting next week.  The route will soon be serviced by a new fleet of quiet, fuel-efficient long-haul planes.  AirAsia wants to expand its network into two or three more Australian cities with the long-range jets, but is treading carefully.  The carrier is also contemplating targeting regional airports with smaller planes in four years\\' time.  Mr Buranasiri said the airline was still learning how to contend with pesky Queensland moths playing havoc with plane engines, and figuring out how to target its advertising to local consumers.  \"We love expansion but we don\\'t want to expand too fast,\"he told AAP.  \"In every market, we need a learning curve. We\\'re in no rush to expand. We need to understand the market first.\" * Reporter travelled to International Paris Air Show courtesy of AirAsia. AAP DM/MJF',\n",

Even better, the sweet tipples shimmer and should give a burst of colour to any cocktail or gin and tonic.  The lemon sherbet gin  is said to be \"zesty and tangy\", while the pear gin  tastes of pear and blackcurrant.  But perhaps most exciting of all is the parma violet flavour , which tastes of the sweets and even changes colour from deep purple to light pink when you add tonic water.  They\\'re not the cheapest gins around though, setting you back £18 each for a 70cl bottle.  All three tipples come with an alcohol by volume (ABV) content of 40 per cent.  The drinks officially landed in Asda stores nationwide as well as on its website today, but some eagle-eyed shoppers spotted them in stores a few days ago.  Facebook page Money Saver Online  shared the exciting news with its followers, and the post has so far racked up 1,800 likes and 7,400 comments.  One user wrote: \"OMG? I need these gins in my life.\"  While another said: \"Lemon sherbet and pear drops? Two of my fave sweets!!\"  The Sun hasn\\'t been able to find other lemon sherbet and pear drop-flavoured gins in the UK\\'s major supermarkets, but the parma violet version is nothing new.  Aldi, for example, is selling its own parma violet gin for just £9.99 - £8 cheaper than Asda\\'s version.  Just keep in mind that this comes in a smaller 50cl bottle and at a lower ABV of just 20 per cent.  Asda and Tesco also sell parma violet gin by Whitley Neill. It\\'s cheapest at Asda where a 70cl costs £23 and comes with an ABV of 43 per cent.  Ed Sowerby, spirits product manager at Asda, said: \"Novelty, quality gins have become a summer must-have for customers looking to entertain with flair and flavour.  \"Working closely with our suppliers, we\\'ve created a range of gins which are both glitzy and gorgeous to look at, but also deliver popular flavours the nation knows and loves.\"  Asda has 639 stores across the UK.

The Jerk Chicken and Thai Green Curry flavours have a recommended retail price of £1.19, although supermarkets are free to set their own prices.  Currently, the new snacks are only available in Tesco, but there are plans to roll them out to other major UK retailers in the next few months.  You can\\'t get them online yet, so you\\'ll need to pop to your nearest store for now. Use Tesco\\'s store locator tool  to find your nearest.  The Pot Noodles were spotted by eagle-eyed Instagrammer NewFoodsUK  who snapped a picture of the jerk chicken flavour alongside the brand\\'s existing BBQ pulled pork version.  And people were excited about the new find with the Instagram post receiving 956 likes at the time of writing from fans.  User Deee_Walker commented: \"I need a jerk chicken Pot Noodle!\"  The new pots are the same size as other standard Pot Noodles coming in at 90g, but they\\'re slightly more expensive than other flavours.  For instance, you can currently get the beef and tomato flavour or the original curry Pot Noodles for 80p from Sainsbury\\'s.  Whereas the new flavours are expected to sell for 40p more at £1.19.  Pot Noodle competitor Levi Roots launched a range of Caribbean instant noodles earlier this year.  But these are more expensive than the Pot Noodle version - costing £1.29 for a smaller 75g tub.  You can also get green Thai curry flavoured instant noodles from lots of different manufacturers.  The cheapest we could find was Naked Noodle\\'s Thai Green Curry pot , which costs £1 for a 104g pot at Asda.  Earlier this year, Pot Noodle launched four new Asian-inspired flavours including Thai red curry and Vietnamese beef pho.  Unlike normal Pot Noodles, the Asian Street food range is made with rice noodles rather than egg ones so they will appear slightly see through.  But the Street Food collection comes in smaller pots than the two new green curry and jerk chicken flavours - weighing in at between 56g and 70g.  It\\'s more expensive too with pots selling for £1.75.  Meanwhile, Morrisons and Amazon are launching same day grocery delivery in five new cities.

       " \"opinion Dark side of reverse mortgage industry: Predatory lending hits seniors A decade after the last financial crisis, money is already flowing into some highly questionable loans. Much of this is simply risky borrowing by highly leveraged companies or homebuyers. But some of it raises questions of propriety.  One case in point is the flourishing business of reverse mortgages, which picked up during the Great Recession. Known for their slick pitchmen touting instant money during daytime TV, these loans have long been known for their high costs and hidden fees. Adding to the debate, a USA TODAY Network investigation published this week found that the industry has become a platform for predatory lending.  The investigation found that nearly 100,000 reverse mortgages had defaulted in recent years, with low-income urban neighborhoods hardest hit. Often, the loans were placed thanks to aggressive door-to-door pitches.  Lenders and loan brokers concentrate on these communities because they know that the homeowners' lack of sophistication, combined with their sometimes difficult financial situations, make them easy targets.  There's nothing inherently wrong with reverse mortgages, which allow seniors to stay in their homes while borrowing against a percentage of the equity. The loan can be taken as lump sums, regular payments, lines of credit or some hybrid of these.  OPPOSING VIEW: A reverse mortgage can be a lifesaver  Leroy Roebuck's story: How small issues can snowball into foreclosure  The homeowners generally don't make loan payments. At death, their estate either sells the property and pays off the loan (which has grown with compounded interest) or simply deeds the property to the lender.  Loans that don't have to be paid back during one's lifetime should not result in a default. But they do, often because the homeowner doesn't make tax or insurance payments, or falls behind on the paperwork.  What's more, if the value of a property drops below the value of the loan, the lenders have taxpayer-based Federal Housing Administration insurance to make up the difference.  With incentives like this, is there any wonder why mortgage brokers would run around the country making their hard sell to unsuspecting and financially squeezed people?  To reduce the number of seniors losing their homes, greater oversight is needed. Reps. Maxine Waters, D-Calif. , and Denny Heck, D-Wash. , for instance, have a proposal that would require a lot more to happen between default and foreclosure.  Beyond that, some more fundamental questions need to be asked, starting with whether the federal government should be in the business of enabling reverse mortgages.  While the concept of allowing seniors to unlock the wealth they have in their homes is sound, the reality is that reverse mortgages add complexity and risk at a time in people's lives when they should be reducing both.  When so many such loans are going into default, it's a clear sign that something is amiss.  If you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page.\",\n",
       " 'News Women\\'s super to dry up faster than men\\'s Australian workers will dramatically outlive their superannuation savings, with a new World Economic Forum report warning account balances have not accelerated fast enough to make up for a deterioration in traditional retirement plans.  Australian women face a larger super gap than men, outliving their savings by 12.6 years. For men, the figure is 9.9 years. Despite describing Australia\\'s retirement saving scheme as \"one of the most well-developed from an accumulation perspective\" the report said long-term approaches were needed for the retirement phase as people in six major economies live longer after finishing work.  The report showed the average man in the United States was on track to outlive their retirement savings by 8.3 years. For US women, it is 10.9 years.  The gap between savings and life expectancy was already at $70 trillion worldwide in 2015, and the report\\'s authors have warned if new measures are not taken to increase overall levels of savings, it will grow to $400 trillion by 2050. The picture is far worse in other countries considered by the report. Japanese women are expected to outlive their savings by nearly 20 years on average, with average savings there less than half of those in Australia. Australians and Americans had the highest level of average savings in the group at 9.7 years, ahead of the Netherlands, UK, Canada and Japan.  Han Yik, head of institutional investors industry for the World Economic Forum, said the shortfalls needed to be addressed by policymakers and individuals to protect lifestyle in non-working years.  \"The real risk people need to manage when investing in their future is the risk of outliving their retirement savings,\" he said. \"As people are living longer, they must ensure they have enough retirement funds to last them through their longer lives.  \"This requires investing with a long-term mindset earlier in life to increase total savings later on.\" At age 65, an average Australian worker is expected to have achieved a retirement balance of 5.8 times their ending salary, with some 90 per cent falling between 3.8 and 8.4 times their ending salary.  The report said many workers remained far too risk-averse in their retirement investing, recommending some young to middle-age savers change their risk outlook and understand that outliving their savings is a far greater risk than short-term investment risk. It called for more creative decumulation solutions to assist workers who live longer after their earning ends. Last month, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told The Australian Financial Review he would commission a review of Australia\\'s retirement income system, including the interaction of superannuation, government pensions and, potentially, taxation.  He was \"positively disposed\" to a review as recommended by the Productivity Commission and signalled the re-elected Morrison government was likely to rekindle a campaign to force a dilution of union and employer group representatives on the boards of industry superannuation funds.',\n",

Some pensioners who are claiming a benefit created by Gordon Brown to aide struggling elderly people - will still get their free TV licence.  However, a number of pensioners are not claiming state pension credit despite being eligible.  \"[At least] 40% of those eligible don\\'t claim it\"  The 47-year-old said: \"Let\\'s hope the BBC uses all its communication resources to communicate to people that they should be claiming pension credit. That should become part of the main campaign next May when it changes.\"  Martin said 1.3 million homes are eligible for the credit, but don\\'t claim it.  The Money Saving Expert said: \"[At least] 40% of those eligible don\\'t claim it.  \"Let\\'s do this together. Let\\'s make this change. Let\\'s talk about this, let\\'s make this a national conversation.\"  Pension credit is a means-tested benefit that helps those on lower incomes by giving them extra money throughout retirement.  It is available for people who are over the state pension age, who live in England, Scotland or Wales. This is currently rising to 66 for both men and women.  Martin continued: \"Pension credit has two elements, and it\\'s effectively a top-up for pensioners to make sure they have enough money coming in. The first one, the main one, is called the guarantee element.  \"It effectively says, if you as a single person have less than £167 worth of income per week or as a couple less than £255 per week, you\\'re entitled to a top-up by the state to get you that. The income could be from pensions, jobs or savings if they\\'re over £10,000.\"  The second element is called the savings element, which tends to apply to people who started their pensions before 2016, and can be worth £600 to £700 a year.  According to Martin, it\\'s given to those who have saved a bit of money towards retirement, but still have low weekly incomes.  The pension credit claim line can be reached on 0800 99 1234. It\\'s open Monday to Friday from 8am to 7.30pm.  You will need your national insurance number, information about your income, savings and investments, as well as details for the account you want the money to be paid into.  The earliest possible date to apply is four months before you reach your state pension age.  If you claim after you reach pension age, you can backdate your claim for up to three months.

People are encouraged to go online and get a state pension forecast to find out how much we will receive and when.  Changes to the state pension age and a complex system means not everyone gets the same amount at the same age.  More than 360,000 people have been issued with online forecasts saying they will be getting a higher amount than they are actually entitled to. This is due to problems with HM Revenue & Customs data on National Insurance records, which are used to calculate how much state pension we each get. You need 35 full qualifying years to receive the full state pension of £168.60 per week.  In some cases, forecasts were more than £1,500 a year higher, according to former pensions minister Steve Webb who has been investigating this issue.  After he raised the problem with the Department for Work and Pensions who played it down as isolated errors, he contacted the Minister for Pensions asking him to investigate.  New mums \\'should be given £2,000\\' to fight financial stress of parenthood  In a letter to Mr Webb, Opperman admitted there are problems, especially for members of workplace pensions who have complex work histories.  He said he has asked officials to explore options to further enhance accuracy. \"Analysis has identified that currently no more than 3% of people will be impacted by the issue you have raised. Ommission or errors will be rectified before they retire.  \"However, I nonetheless recognise there is a significant problem here.\"  Steve Webb, now director of policy at insurance giant Royal London, said: \"People are increasingly encouraged to use online services to help plan their retirement, and the new pensions dashboard will rely heavily on such data.  \"It is therefore very worrying that hundreds of thousands of people may have received incorrect state pension forecasts and in some cases will have taken decisions about their retirement plans on the basis of incorrect information.\"  Webb says that now the Government is aware of the scale of the problem, it must put an urgent stop to the issuing of incorrect statements. \"Individuals need to have confidence that the information they receive from the government is accurate and should not have to live with the uncertainty that a statement they have already received may be seriously incorrect\".

       " 'Business Quick on the drawdown Your Money  PENSIONERS are being urged to review their income drawdown plans to avoid paying tens of thousands of pounds in punitive charges over the course of their retirement.  New calculations show somebody with a £100,000 pension pot could get £32,000 less retirement income from a high-charging plan, compared to the cheapest on the market. This could also increase the likelihood of depleting their pot and running out of money in their final years.  Since pension freedoms were introduced in 2015, growing numbers have shunned annuities and invested their retirement savings through income drawdown, taking cash when they need it.  Drawdown offers greater flexibility and allows you to benefit from stock market growth and dividends but research from City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) shows charges can differ dramatically.  Some charge as little as 0.4 per cent a year but others can total as much as 1.6 per cent. That may sound a minor difference, but over a typical 20 or 25 year retirement it can really add up, according to calculations by online investment platform AJ Bell.  DO THE SUMS If somebody with a £100,000 pot withdrew £5,000 income a year from age 65 and increased that in line with inflation, their money would last until age 92 with a 0.4 per cent charge. In total they would receive £176,722.  However at 1.6 per cent that income would run out by age 88 and they would have received £144,225 overall, or £32,497 less.  AJ Bell senior analyst Tom Selby said: \"Shop around to get the best deal and review your retirement pot at least once a year.\"  COMPARE COSTS More than 20 companies offer drawdown including Aegon, AJ Bell, Aviva, Barnett Waddingham, Fidelity, Hargreaves Lansdown, Interactive Investor, LV=, PensionBee and Royal London.  Comparing charges is not easy as they may include set-up fees, annual administration charges, platform costs, dealing commission and underlying fund charges. A search on CompareDrawdown.co.uk suggests most providers charge more than 0.4 per cent a year. The cheapest plan it sourced, from Royal London, charged 0.85 per cent a year, with Standard Life next at 1.02 per cent. Hargreaves Lansdown charged 1.44 per cent.  DRAWBACKS Leaving your money in drawdown does allow you to benefit from stock market growth, but you will suffer if you make bad investment decisions or the market falls at the wrong time.  David Everett, partner at specialist pensions adviser LCP, said you must have some understanding of how markets work. Nobody knows how long they will live, so judging how much you can afford to draw is not easy. \"It could lead to potential ruin for some,\" Everett warned.  If your pension is large enough you could use half to buy an annuity that gives you a guaranteed income for life, then leave the rest in drawdown.  This is a complicated area and you should consider taking independent financial advice.',\n",

       " 'Texas Public Pension Funds Keep Pace With Major Benchmarks The investments which Texas\\' public pension systems selected for securing their members\\' retirement benefits fit closely with their long-term expectations for returns and exceeded global benchmarks. The findings are from the latest survey of 63 responding public employee retirement systems for police, firefighters, and municipal employees performed by the Maples Group for the Texas Association of Public Employee Retirement Systems.  The survey respondents - nearly two-thirds of the systems monitored by the Texas Pension Review Board - had a 7.3 percent composite return for the 20-year period ended September 30, 2018.  \"It\\'s very important that pension funds have strong long-term performance to match their employees\\' anticipated career path and retirement goals,\" said Paul Brown, the president of TEXPERS\\' Board of Directors. \"Our members\\' ability to get close to future targets is remarkable. It is comforting to public employees who want to know their benefits will be there after 20 or more years of service.\"  While the groups\\' composite returns slightly underperformed their collective goal of 7.4 percent, they outperformed a widely recognized industry benchmark of global stocks and bonds. They beat, by 1.8 percent, a passive 60 percent allocation to the MSCI ACWI Index and a 40 percent allocation to the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate over the last two decades on an annualized basis net of fees.  \"It is remarkable how the pension systems have handled the preceding 20-year period,\" said James Perry, the Maples Group study coordinator. \"Considering that it included the Dot-Com bubble and bust of 1998-2003, the global financial crisis of 2007-09, and the uncertainty of quantitative easing and its unwinding, it\\'s safe to say that as a group these systems have successfully navigated some of the worst that the global markets have thrown at them. It\\'s a credit to their ability to manage their members\\' retirement assets.\"  TEXPERS released its yearly \" Report on the Asset Allocation and Investment Performance of Texas Public Employee Retirement Systems  \" at its 30th Annual Conference for pension fund trustees and staff in Austin. The study confirmed that Texas pension funds hold 51 percent of their dollar-weighted asset allocations in domestic and international stocks. Alternative strategy investments comprised 28 percent and fixed income 20 percent of their portfolios. The respondents manage $58.45 billion in combined total assets.  Overall Texas pension funds continued to orient their target rates toward more conservative expectations. The average rate in 2018 was 7.4 percent, down from 7.5 percent in 2017, and 8.0 percent in 2013. By lowering their target rates, the pension systems have responded to widespread sentiment that the higher returns of the late 1990s and early 2000s may not be possible in future market and economic environments.  Brown recognized the following standout systems for 20-year performance above the target:  8.71 percent - Houston Municipal Employees Pension System      8.33 percent - CPS Energy Employees\\' Benefit Trust 8.20 percent - Austin Police Retirement System',\n",
       " 'Sport NRL moves to appease concerns over Inglis deal The NRL has taken the extraordinary step of contacting club bosses in an attempt to address concerns about the salary cap ramifications of Greg Inglis\\' retirement.  As Souths prepare Inglis\\' post-football package, which they will take to the NRL for approval early next week, rival clubs received an email on Wednesday from chief operating officer Nick Weeks, saying no final decision had been made about what would be included and excluded from the Rabbitohs\\' salary cap.  While no clubs will begrudge Inglis remaining in the game, especially because of his brilliant service to rugby league on and off the field - particularly in the indigenous community - there remain questions about how much Souths will save following his retirement and how much they will have available to spend on replacements.  Inglis stood to earn about $1.5 million for the remaining 18 months of his deal.  \"The short answer is that the NRL is not yet aware of the arrangements Greg has reached with the club in relation to his retirement,\" Weeks wrote. \"We have not made any decisions in relation to how that might be treated from a cap perspective, but will do after we receive information and a submission from the Rabbitohs. We will provide you with information about this once the decision is made.\"  Souths said on Monday the plan was for Inglis to work with the club and NRL in a variety of coaching, community, mentoring and ambassador roles.  It is understood Inglis stands to earn about $200,000 from those proposed positions each year. Should the NRL have any issues with Souths\\' arrangements, the governing body has the option to force the club to absorb some of that income into their salary cap.  Some clubs believe a fair outcome would have been for Souths to carry Inglis\\' outstanding $500,000 on their cap for this season. Penrith did just that with Peter Wallace last year, even though he retired from the game midway through the season.  \"Greg has done an enormous job in the game, he\\'s been around a long time, we all want a place in the game for him, but we just want to make sure there is transparency,\" Canterbury chief executive Andrew Hill said.  Souths were already on the lookout for an outside back, but a cheap option rather than a marquee man for this year.  Brisbane\\'s Gehamat Shibasaki remains on the radar for Souths and has worked under Wayne Bennett. Bryson Goodwin was viewed as an option for 2020, but is unlikely to be granted a release from Warrington.  Braidon Burns remains the preferred left-centre option to take over Inglis\\' No.3 jersey.  There have been growing calls for James Roberts to return to Redfern and work again under Bennett, but Souths sacked him for good reason the first time.  There has been no contact from Roberts\\' management.  Inglis broke the news to his teammates after Saturday\\'s win over the Warriors.',\n",
       " 'Principal bulks up with addition of Wells Fargo\\'s record-keeping business Principal Financial Group will acquire the institutional retirement and trust business of Wells Fargo & Co. for $1.2 billion.  Included in the deal are Wells Fargo\\'s record-keeping services for defined contribution, defined benefit and employee stock ownership plans; executive deferred compensation program; institutional asset advisory business; and trust and custody offerings for the retirement and non-retirement markets.  Principal will add 3.9 million retirement plan participants from Wells Fargo after the deal closes in the third quarter for a total of 7.5 million participants.  \"We think this is a great move,\" said Daniel J. Houston, Principal\\'s chairman, president and CEO, noting that \"the retirement business increasingly has become one of scale, and this acquisition moves the needle for Principal.\"  Increasing consolidation within the retirement plan record-keeping industry was one of the drivers behind Principal\\'s move now to pick up Wells Fargo\\'s retirement business, Mr. Houston said.  Some of Wells Fargo\\'s areas of strength, including its prominence in the $10 million to $1 billion range of the DC plan record-keeping market and close relationships with DC plan consultants, also were attractive to help Principal broaden its range of services in the DC plan market, Mr. Houston said.  Buying Wells Fargo\\'s record-keeping and trust business will help Principal gain enough scale to move higher in the ranks of service providers.  Wells Fargo\\'s assets under administration totaled $827 billion as of Dec. 31. As of the same date, the combined AUA of Principal and Wells Fargo for DC plans was $359 billion and $500 billion for all retirement accounts, said Jane Slusark, a Principal spokeswoman.  The combined $416.3 billion of U.S. defined contribution plan record-keeping AUA for Principal ($208.8 billion) and Wells Fargo ($207.5 billion) as of Sept. 30 would move the firm to sixth place from eighth and 10th, respectively, in Pensions & Investments\\' annual ranking of defined contribution record keepers, according to data provided by each firm.  About 2,500 people work in Wells Fargo\\'s institutional retirement business, and job layoffs might be necessary as Principal assesses the synergies between the two similar businesses prior to the close of the deal, Ms. Slusark said.  Principal will maintain four of Wells Fargo\\'s primary offices in Charlotte, N.C.; Roseville, Minn.; Waco, Texas; and Manila, Philippines, she added.  Principal will pay $1.2 billion upfront to Wells Fargo through a combination of between $400 million and $500 million in new debt and the remainder in cash, showed a Principal presentation about the deal provided to P&I.  The agreement includes an earnout of up to $150 million payable to Wells Fargo two years after the deal has closed if existing client fee revenue retention exceeds a preset level.  The firm expects to accrue $60 million of pretax run-rate net expense savings after the Wells Fargo business is fully integrated in 2022, Principal\\'s report said.',\n",
       " 'WSJ Pro Public-Private Partnership Aims to Strengthen Cybersecurity Workers Pipeline; Mastercard and CIA part of program to help train and recruit new cybersecurity professionals A group of companies and federal agencies aim to lure new graduates into cybersecurity careers with a program of on-the-job training and student loan repayments.  Mastercard Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Workday Inc. said Tuesday they will work with 11 government agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Energy Department, to help train and recruit new cybersecurity professionals.  As part of the Cybersecurity Talent Initiative, graduating college students apply for a two-year cybersecurity position at one of the agencies, after which they become eligible for a job at one of the three businesses. Those firms will pay up to $75,000 of a candidate\\'s student-loan debt, on top of a salary.  In return, participating companies are hoping to get access to a new stream of recruits who pick up high-level skills during their stint in government service, said Ron Green, chief security officer at Mastercard. It will also help participating companies fill roles that require a security clearance, which often involves a lengthy screening process to access sensitive information.  \"Government agencies regularly get attacked by nation state actors-that\\'s great experience for people who go on to the private sector,\" he said.  The initiative is the latest example of companies trying to address a growing cybersecurity talent deficit. The estimated shortage of qualified cybersecurity talent is about 498,000 in North America and 2.93 million globally, according to ISC(2), a nonprofit association of cybersecurity professionals. This is up from a shortage of about 1.5 million in 2015.  \"Companies are making a concerted effort to fill the gap?and they\\'re reaching all the way down into the student level,\" said John McCumber, director of cybersecurity advocacy at ISC(2). Student loan repayments are a new tactic, he said, \"but we\\'ve seen sign-on bonuses, inducements for ongoing education and companies covering the cost of cybersecurity certifications.\"  About two-thirds of students who graduated in 2017 had student loan debt, averaging $28,650 per borrower, according to data from the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success.  Simply offering higher salaries doesn\\'t address the root of the talent problem, Mr. Green said.  \"Until we get more people in the field, it will continue to be that way,\" he said. \"We\\'re fairly aggressive with our pay, but that alone isn\\'t going to solve the problem.\"  In 2018, Mastercard hired about 2,000 people for cybersecurity roles. In addition to the newly announced talent initiative, the company tries to attract job candidates with internships and an apprenticeship program with the military.  The first group of participants in the Cybersecurity Talent Initiative will be placed in government agencies in 2020. The program is also aiming to add more corporate partners, said Mr. Green.

       " \"504 words 10 April 2019 07:00 PM PR Newswire PRN English Copyright ©    2019    PR Newswire Association LLC.    All Rights Reserved.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is a federal law that safeguards qualified retirement plans, including pensions, 401(k) plans, and profit-sharing programs. This law also regulates welfare benefit plans, such as insurance plans for group life, health, dental, disability, and supplementary fringe benefit plans. The Department of Labor enforces ERISA compliance through audits that can happen at any time, sometimes with no warning.  It is vital that employers' employee benefit and retirement plans comply with these ERISA mandates, no matter how large or small the company is. Group health plans, dental and vision plans, insured disability benefits, HSAs and FSAs, and prescription drug plans are some examples of plans that must meet ERISA's terms.  According to Section 402 of ERISA, all employee benefit plans must be established, and maintained, per a written plan document that clearly defines specific plan basics, such as the fiduciary who is authorized to manage the plan, the source of plan contributions, measures for amending and terminating the plan, and the distribution of responsibilities for the operation of the plan between the employer and the insurance carrier or third-party administrator. Plus, every plan must be outlined a document that provides participants with a detailed plan summary, which is extremely important for ERISA compliance. It is vital that the following key information is present in the summary: the plan name, the employer's federal tax identification number, the contact information for the plan administrator (name, address, and telephone number), the plan year, the plan number (for annual reporting purposes), the source of plan contributions, a claims procedure, information about plan trustees, content regarding eligibility for plan participation, the name and address of the plan's agent for service of legal process, and a statement of ERISA rights.  In addition, to maintain ERISA compliance, employers need to include information about COBRA continuation coverage as well as HIPAA pre-existing condition exclusions. Employers are legally obligated to distribute a free copy of this information to each plan participant within 30 days of the participant request. Failure to do so may result in a $110 per day penalty. And, employers who fail to meet these requirements can face fines of up to $1,100 per day for each late Form 5500.

       " 'Financial wellness for grads featured University of Wyoming ; Laramie, WY - features  By Sydney De Vault  Finances can be a very daunting part of growing up for any young adult, but there are some tips and basic knowledge that can make this responsibility easier.  Advice on budgeting, credit and other aspects will be the focus of a financial wellness seminar for students hosted today from 1 to 3 p.m. in Classroom Building room 144.  Financial wellness includes knowing how to manage personal finances, budget, repay loans and save for retirement. Though upon graduating students may be making a steady income, following graduation there are a variety of expenses that will begin to-rent, utilities, insurance, payback of loans and general costs of living. Financial wellness skills can help alleviate the stress of adult financial responsibilities.  One of the most important aspects of finances is a budget, which may be simple to create but difficult to stick to. Creating a budget allows people to evaluate the money they spend on a monthly basis, change their spending habits and save more.  Budgeting for many allows people to reach their financial goals of travel or purchasing their first home much faster than those who do not create or follow their budgets. This is especially critical since easy access to money, like through credit, makes the temptation for overspending on nonessentials much higher than it once was, according to TheBalance.com.  Another very important aspect of finances is to maintain a good credit score. The idea of a credit score and decisions made in your early 20s impacting the rest of your life can seem daunting to students and recent grads.  To build and maintain a good credit score, people should always pay their cards and loans on time, avoid using a credit card if they do not or cannot pay the bill and be careful and do their research before opening a credit card account, according to MoneyCrashers.com.  Despite its pitfalls, credit can also be helpful and may even be required for future purchases like a mortgage loan. If maintained well, credit can only positively impact your life in the future.  For many upon graduating the most intimidating and immediate financial need is paying back any student loans. Most payment plans span over a 10-year period for student loans, unless the student opted or qualified for a different payment option. Many federal loans offer the ability to change the date, amount or even plan if you find yourself having a hard time making the payments.  While growing up might be seen as a stressful task due mostly to the finance responsibilities that are suddenly thrust upon you, there are ways that you can avoid or lessen the stress that so many people seem to find themselves wrapped up in. From budgeting to basic research on credit cards and so much more, there are ways that you can ensure your finance security for your future.

       " 'RealEstate No room for emotional baggage SENTIMENTAL KEEPSAKES WON\\'T HELP SELL YOUR HOUSE SO PACK THEM AWAY, WRITES SAMANTHA HEALY  PLANNING to sell your family home? You had better box up any emotional baggage. Sure, your collection of travel curios may bring back fond memories, and that quirky family photograph may prompt a chuckle, but they can be a huge turn-off for potential buyers.  \"The point of staging a house for sale is to encourage buyers to imagine themselves living in the home, creating an immediate emotional connection with the property,\" Laura Sinclair of Place Graceville said.  \"This is difficult to achieve when the house is still filled with personal items from the current owners.\" Ms Sinclair said there were six things to always consider when preparing a property.  \"The No. 1 rule of staging a house for sale is to use a minimalist approach. Clutter is distracting and makes spaces feel smaller, by decluttering you invite buyers to view a functional space, rather than mess,\" she said.  Lighting is also an important factor and can even impact the mood of a potential buyer. Ms Sinclair said ensure there is plenty of natural light flowing in, and when that\\'s not possible, switch every available light on.  As for street appeal, Ms Sinclair said a good first impression could make a buyer fall in love with a property before they even stepped through the front door.  \"Think about freshening up the garden or painting the front fence,\" she said. Selling a house was also not the time to \"flaunt bold colours\", with neutral tones appealing to more buyers.  A clean house was also a major selling point, with Ms Sinclair noting something as simple as a dirty sink could be a deal-breaker.  And finally, the hardest part - turning a property from a home into a stranger\\'s dream house.  \"When selling your property, it can be helpful to remove family photos, cards and any other personal items which may distract potential buyers from seeing their own future in the home,\" she said.

       " 'PitchBook Unveils Interactive Dashboard on US Venture Capital Financing in Female-Founded Companies SEATTLE, Feb. 28 -- Pitchbook issued the following news release:  PitchBook, the premier data provider for the private and public equity markets, today released The VC Female Founders Dashboard in honor of Women\\'s History month in March as well as International Women\\'s Day on March 8, 2019. The dashboard illustrates US VC investment activity in female-founded startups across sectors and geographies over time. Users can interact with charts including total investment activity by state, MSA, industry and stage and filter by \"female-only\" founded startups and \"female & male\" founders. PitchBook also profiles select female-founded companies and female-founded VC firms with mandates to invest in minority and women-led businesses (MWB). According to the first iteration of the Dashboard, startups with all female founders received $2.9 billion in VC investment in 2018, representing 2.3% of all VC dollars invested in 2018, down from 2.7% in 2017. The dashboard will be updated on a monthly-basis and can be accessed here(https://pitchbook.com/news/articles/the-vc-female-founders-dashboard).  \"While the number of deals closed by startups with all female founders has more than quadrupled since 2008, deal count still represented just 6% of all venture financings in 2018,\" said Joelle Sostheim, VC analyst at PitchBook. \"Heightened awareness of the funding gap has helped increase resources to support female founders - it is our goal to closely monitor and report on these programs and emerging trends with the dashboard.\"  US Key Takeaways Uncovered by PitchBook\\'s Female Founder VC Dashboard:  * In terms of capital invested, the percentage of financing in female-only founded startups has hovered between 1.7-3.3% since 2008.  * In 2018, female-only founded startups closed 81 late-stage deals totaling $1.5 billion, more than doubling deal value since 2017 ($747 million). The increase in late-stage deals for this group suggests a healthy maturation of female-founded companies and ability to raise growth capital.  * Some valuable startups with all female founders include, Humacyte ($789 million post-money valuation), The RealReal ($745 million post-money valuation) and Moda Operandi ($650 million post-money valuation).

       " \"Investing Action Plan Tesla's Big Deadline, Key Indicators, Foot Locker Due: Investing Action Plan Here's your Investing Action Plan for Friday: what you need to know as an investor for the coming day. Tesla faces a deadline for repaying convertible notes it issues, putting Tesla stock into motion tomorrow, while several important economic indicators are due as well as Foot Locker earnings.  Tesla Stock Shortfall  On Friday, $920 million in Tesla convertible senior notes will expire at a conversion price of $359.87 per share.  If Tesla stock were valued at or above the conversion price, then the debt would convert to new shares and the company wouldn't have to pay off those notes with cash.  But Tesla stock rose 1.6% to close at 319.88 on the stock market today, meaning Elon Musk will likely have to come up with the payment in cash, barring a stunning rally.  Late Thursday, Electrek reported that Tesla has finally started selling Model 3s for a $35,000 price tag, though with shorter range. While the starting base price of the Model 3 has always been listed at $35,000, it hasn't been possible to actually buy it for that price as other features pushed it well past $35,000.  Tesla stock dipped in late trading.  Economic Indicators  The Commerce Department will release the December report for personal income and spending at 8:30 a.m. ET. Due to the government shutdown, the report was delayed. The January report, which was supposed to come out Friday, has been pushed back. After the December retail sales report showed a surprise drop, the personal income and spending report could offer more perspective. Analysts see a 0.3% month-over-month drop in spending and a 0.4% gain in income. The report also contains the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge.  The Institute for Supply Management will release its U.S. manufacturing activity gauge, and analysts see a drop to a still-robust 55.2 in February from 56.6 in January amid President Donald Trump's ongoing trade wars.  Foot Locker Earnings  The athletic gear retailer reports Q4 results before the market opens. Analysts expect EPS to grow 10% to $1.39, while revenue dips 1.4% to $2.18 billion.  Last week, Foot Locker announced a 10% dividend hike and OK'd a $1.2 billion stock buyback. And earlier this month, it made the biggest investment in its history with a $100 million stake in GOAT Group, which operates marketplaces where sneakers collectors can buy authentic brand shoes.  Foot Locker stock rose 0.25% to 59.52.

       " 'RealEstate No room for emotional baggage SENTIMENTAL KEEPSAKES WON\\'T HELP SELL YOUR HOUSE SO PACK THEM AWAY, WRITES SAMANTHA HEALY  PLANNING to sell your family home? You had better box up any emotional baggage. Sure, your collection of travel curios may bring back fond memories, and that quirky family photograph may prompt a chuckle, but they can be a huge turn-off for potential buyers.  \"The point of staging a house for sale is to encourage buyers to imagine themselves living in the home, creating an immediate emotional connection with the property,\" Laura Sinclair of Place Graceville said.  \"This is difficult to achieve when the house is still filled with personal items from the current owners.\" Ms Sinclair said there were six things to always consider when preparing a property.  \"The No. 1 rule of staging a house for sale is to use a minimalist approach. Clutter is distracting and makes spaces feel smaller, by decluttering you invite buyers to view a functional space, rather than mess,\" she said.  Lighting is also an important factor and can even impact the mood of a potential buyer. Ms Sinclair said ensure there is plenty of natural light flowing in, and when that\\'s not possible, switch every available light on.  As for street appeal, Ms Sinclair said a good first impression could make a buyer fall in love with a property before they even stepped through the front door.  \"Think about freshening up the garden or painting the front fence,\" she said. Selling a house was also not the time to \"flaunt bold colours\", with neutral tones appealing to more buyers.  A clean house was also a major selling point, with Ms Sinclair noting something as simple as a dirty sink could be a deal-breaker.  And finally, the hardest part - turning a property from a home into a stranger\\'s dream house.  \"When selling your property, it can be helpful to remove family photos, cards and any other personal items which may distract potential buyers from seeing their own future in the home,\" she said.  Brisbane\\'s Look Home Staging founder Heidi Fenton-Smith said having renters still living in the house was also often a turn-off for buyers who see clutter rather than the house itself.  \"They are not invested in the process and therefore shouldn\\'t be given the task of presenting the property for sale,\" she said.  \"Buyers and investors do find it difficult to look past the furniture and/or mess.\" Ms Fenton-Smith, who has styled many homes for sale, said that owners who had lived in the property for a long time often could not see the negatives that would be clearly visible to people visiting for the first time.

The Student Senate of California Community Colleges, the University of California Student Association and the Cal State Student Association rallied together with legislators, administrations, research organizations and advocacy groups to call for financial aid reform for all college students to our state leaders.  Mia Kagianas, president of the Cal State Student Association and former Sacramento State Associated Students, Inc. president said she worked with other leaders from different student organizations.  \"At the start of the fall semester, myself as well as the president of the University of California Student Association, and the president of Student State Senate of California Community Colleges came together,\" said Kagianas.

The cost of tuition, housing, food, transportation, books and supplies are not met according to Jose Medina, an assemblyman from Riverside.  \"We know from the students that Cal Grant does not cover all the costs,\" Medina said. \"Things that are really major parts of the cost of higher education.\"  According to Assemblyman Jesse Gabriel from Encino and author of Assembly Bill 541 and 542, one in 20 California college students experiences homelessness.

Senate Bill 291 would establish the California Community College Student Financial Aid program to community college students. The program gives eligibility to students that need financial aid and attend an eligible California community college.  \"Students have been heard loud and clear that the financial aid system that is in place is outdated, over-complex and really does not serve the needs of California students,\" said Medina.

       " 'Funds Calpers Investment Chief Renews Pitch for Private-Equity Revamp; Staff of the nation\\'s largest pension is trying to sell a new investment model to its sometimes skeptical board The board of the nation\\'s largest pension still has plenty of questions about a proposed shake-up in its private-equity strategy, roughly two years after the pension\\'s staff began developing the plan.  Ben Meng, chief investment officer of the California Public Employees\\' Retirement System, on Tuesday detailed the proposed new strategy for private-equity investing, arguing that without it the underfunded pension system could have trouble hitting return targets and making its required payouts to retirees.  Mr. Meng, who joined the $337 billion fund last month, argued that the new strategy was necessary to get more exposure to the best-performing private-equity managers.  \"We need private equity, we need more of it, and we need it now,\" he said.  Calpers\\' private-equity reform has attracted some controversy since it was unveiled last May, after more than a year of discussion behind-the-scenes.  The plan would hire general partners to manage two new companies initially funded entirely by Calpers but not part of the pension system. One company would make late-stage venture-capital investments and one would seek investments with longer hold times than the five years typical for private equity.  On Tuesday, several members of Calpers 13-person board expressed skepticism about the proposal, citing concerns about transparency and oversight. Others, however, appeared to support the plan. There is no timeline for a board vote on the proposal, a Calpers spokeswoman wrote in an email.  The governance structure \"gives me pause,\" said California State Controller Betty Yee, who said she was concerned that the board would be giving up its oversight responsibilities to the outside managers.  California State Treasurer Fiona Ma also said she had doubts.  \"Setting up a whole new division with more people, and trying to attract the top talent, is going to be difficult, and I\\'m not leaning in that direction,\" she said.  The fund\\'s meeting on Tuesday continued with discussions between the board and the staff that were closed to the public.  Calpers\\' private-equity plans have come into focus slowly, as the pension has fielded tough questions about the approach amid significant staff turnover. The plan was developed under former CIO Ted Eliopoulos, whose departure was announced three days before the new model was rolled out. Former chief operating officer Elisabeth Bourqui resigned last month after about six months on the job.  The fund is also without a permanent head of private equity. Sarah Corr is serving as interim head for the asset class and Calpers is currently interviewing candidates for the permanent role, a spokeswoman for the pension wrote in an email.  Mr. Meng on Tuesday advocated for a sharp increase in private-equity commitments. Private-equity was Calpers\\' best-performing asset class last year, with a 6.3% net return, though it underperformed its policy benchmark.',\n",

From their April bill onwards, around 250,000 Virgin Mobile pay monthly and Sim-only users will see price rises.  These are not inflation linked increases, which is what we\\'ve seen announced by EE, O2, and Three Mobile in recent weeks.  Instead, these come amid a shakeup by Virgin Mobile of \"old tariffs\".  Virgin Mobile couldn\\'t given us an average increase but we\\'ve seen customers on social media complaining about bills rising by a whopping £8.87 a month - or nearly £107 a year.  One user tweeted: \"Virgin wants to increase my mobile line rental by £8.87 per month from £4.13 to £13.00? 15 months into a 36 month contract!!!\"  Another said: \"Virgin Mobile changing my £4.13pm contract (6GB data, unltd texts, 1500 mins) to £13pm (5GB, unltd texts 2500 mins)?

Can they do this?\"  Virgin Mobile says affected users will be contacted about the hikes by letter or email.  But affected customers are allowed to alter or cancel their contracts penalty free, as long as they do so by March 31.  It\\'s worth bearing in mind that Virgin Media is likely to up prices again this year in line with inflation.  The provider wouldn\\'t confirm to us how it will calculate increases this year, but last year Virgin Mobile upped prices by 3.3 per cent in line with March\\'s retail prices index (RPI) measure of inflation.  A Virgin Media spokesperson said: \"We want our customers to enjoy our latest and greatest mobile plans so we\\'re removing some old tariffs and making a limited number of price adjustments for a small number of customers.  \"Any changes made will be communicated clearly to our customers.\"  Virgin Mobile has 3.1million customers in total. Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) customers are unaffected.  The group\\'s parent company, Virgin Media, hiked bills for millions of broadband, TV and home phone customers by 4.5 per cent last autumn.

       " \"Money,Shopping,Tesco PUMP WARS Tesco gives Scots chance to save on petrol as supermarket brings back popular 5p off a litre offer The deal is available to customers who spend at least £50 in a Tesco store or online until this Sunday  TESCO has brought back an offer that gives motorists 5p off every litre of petrol or diesel.  The current deal is available to customers who spend £50 in a Tesco store or online until this Sunday, February 24.  All you need to do to enjoy the offer is spend at least £50 in a Tesco store, where you'll be given a voucher valid for two weeks.  Or if you're an online customer and spend £50 or more, you'll receive the fuel coupon when your groceries are delivered or when you pick them up in a store. This must be used by March 3.  To redeem the coupon, simply fill up your car at a Tesco petrol station and hand it over to get your discount.  Tesco says it can only be used on one purchase of fuel, up to a maximum of 100 litres.  Ways to cut down on your fuel costs  HERE are some tips on how you can slash the cost of fuel  * Make your car more fuel-efficient. You can do this by keeping your tyres inflated, taking the roof rack off, emptying your car of clutter and turning off your air con when driving at lower speeds.  * Find the cheapest fuel prices. PetrolPrices.com and Confused.com allows you to search prices of UK petrol stations. All you need to do is enter in your postcode and tell it how far you want to travel (up to 20 miles).  * Drive more efficiently. Some ways to do this, include:  * Accelerate gradually without over-revving  * Always drive on the highest possible gear  * If you can, allow your car to slow down naturally as your brake is a money burner  * Re-starting your car is expensive, if you can keep moving  The £50 spending excludes purchases at any café & tobacco kiosks and of fuel, lottery products, gift cards, stamps, prescriptions, infant milk formula, Tesco Bank, and on travel money.  For the full terms and conditions, see Tesco's website.  As always, it is worth comparing petrol prices to nearby stations in advance to make sure you're not paying more than you have to - though the 5p off a litre may outweigh any difference.  The Tesco offer may come in handy as petrol prices are set to soar by £160 a year.  Sainsbury's and Asda's mega-merger is also being probed over fears it could send petrol prices sky-high.  Petrol and diesel prices have actually fallen for a third month in a row, yet retailers are still failing to pass the savings onto customers.  We pay for your stories!

       " 'Making a Will and how you can make a donation to charity The process of making a will is something that is so often overlooked or put off until it is too late.  It is not surprising at times, particularly when you ask yourself the question why would I want to think about my death?\\' when at an age where you might still feel energetic and healthy.  When the time is right, the process is one that you will be thanked for - and indeed thankful for yourself - when the real benefits after you are gone are learned. Apart from it being a positive gesture, those who include a legacy\\' charity donation in their will can also soften an additional burden that comes following your death.  As the famous quote goes: \"only two things in life are certain: death and taxes\".  If you are worried about the Inheritance Tax that might have to be paid when you die, leaving a gift to charity can in fact reduce the bill. Leaving a part or your entire estate to charity can reduce and even cancel out the Inheritance Tax liability, as a donation in your will does not count towards the total taxable value - known as a charitable legacy\\'.  You can also cut the Inheritance Tax rate on the rest of your estate from 40% to 36% if you leave at least 10% of your net estate\\' to a charity.  Of course, what is there to stop you from donating right away? Cash donations or anything you own again are not counted as part of your estate after your death. Again, Inheritance Tax could be cut or even eliminated by this gesture. There could also be some relief from Income Tax when you donate to a charity while you are still alive.  Nicola Dalzell, Partner and Head of Wills at Tilly, Bailey & Irvine, said \"leaving a legacy to a charity close to your heart helps that charity carry on their amazing work and from a tax point of view, leaving a legacy to a charity helps mitigate inheritance tax.\"  The UK is well known for its generosity. Almost £10billion was donated to charity last year alone, £2.8billion of that courtesy of people leaving money to a cause in their Will. Despite this and over 35% of over-40s in the UK saying they would give a small amount of money in their Will, only 6.3% actually go through with that promise.  Talk through your intentions with your family to ensure no heartache occurs in the distant future when everything plays out. If a charity is concerned, this is also the time to explain to them how proud you are of this donation, and explain to others close to you just what they can do to help.  If you want to make a difference, don\\'t hesitate to contact Tilly Bailey & Irvine\\'s wills and probate solicitors in Teesside from offices in Stockton, Hartlepool, Wynyard or Barnard Castle on 01429 350062.',\n",

Navient's board said Monday that it voted to turn down the $12.50-a-share proposal from hedge fund Canyon Capital Advisors LLC and private-equity firm Platinum Equity Advisors LLC, believing it undervalues the company and is lacking in other ways.

Navient's advisers had told Canyon it would need to be more than $15, according to a letter Navient sent to the fund that was released publicly Monday. Navient has a market value of about $3 billion.  The Wall Street Journal first reported on the offer and that Navient rejected it earlier Monday.  Canyon is a longtime Navient shareholder with about a 9.9% stake, according to FactSet. Platinum is a private-equity firm based in Los Angeles.  Wilmington, Del.-based Navient services student loans, handling billing and helping borrowers with repayment plans and loan consolidations. Like other servicers, its business practices have been heavily scrutinized in recent years as millions of Americans struggle with student-loan debt. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and several state attorneys general have accused Navient of misleading borrowers about how to repay their loans. Navient has said the allegations are false and it is defending itself in court.  One of Navient's complaints about the offer, according to the letter, is that it doesn't address how to deal with the company's lawsuits and regulatory matters. The company also said it believes the bidders don't appear to have a plan for the roughly $10 billion of Navient's debt that could come due in a change of control.  Navient said that Canyon and Platinum approached it in October about potentially making an offer and the three parties entered into a confidentiality agreement to allow for so-called due diligence. Canyon's adviser at one point indicated the offer could be in the range of $14 to $15 a share, which Navient's advisors said was too low, according to Navient's letter.  The confidentiality agreement included a standstill period that would have prev ented Canyon from launching a proxy fight, which ended Friday. That is when Canyon delivered the offer, Navient said.  Navient said that Canyon, as part of its offer, asked the company to extend by several weeks its late-February deadline to nominate directors, to give it more time to conduct due diligence, but that Navient rejected the request. Canyon, a sometime-activist investor that launched a proxy fight in 2016 against Ambac Financial Group Inc.-which it later withdrew-still has until Feb. 23 to nominate directors.

       " 'Connolly - Walorski Reintroduce the Federal Firefighter Pay Equity Act; Rep. Gerald E. \"Gerry\" Connolly (D-VA) News Release Representatives Gerald E. Connolly (D-VA) and Jackie R. Walorski (R-IN) have reintroduced the Federal Firefighter Pay Equity Act, bipartisan legislation to ensure federal firefighters are eligible for the same full and fair retirement benefits as their state and local counterparts.  Every day, more than 15,000 federal firefighters put their lives at risk to protect our nation\\'s most critical assets - including the families, homes, and infrastructure on military installations across the country. Yet under current law, these brave first responders are denied the robust retirement package they so clearly deserve. Unlike their counterparts in state and local government, federal firefighters are not credited with the additional income from mandatory overtime for the purposes of calculating their retirement benefits.  The Federal Firefighter Pay Equity Act would correct this injustice. By taking into account the number of overtime hours worked by federal firefighters each year, this bill would allow for a more accurate and equitable retirement calculation for our nation\\'s federal firefighters.  \"These courageous men and women work grueling hours in the most difficult of circumstances,\" said Congressman Gerry Connolly (D-VA). \"It is our absolute responsibility to provide them with a retirement worthy of the sacrifices they have made in service to the United States. Our bipartisan legislation fulfills that responsibility, and ensures that our retired federal firefighters are compensated fairly and fully.\"  \"Thousands of federal firefighters across America - including many at Grissom Air Reserve Base in Indiana - risk their lives every day to keep people safe and protect our national security,\" said Congresswoman Jackie Walorski (R-IN). \"We have a responsibility to make sure they are treated fairly in retirement. The bipartisan Federal Firefighter Pay Equity Act will ensure these brave and hardworking first responders get the full compensation and benefits they deserve.\"  \"Federal fire fighters spend their careers protecting the public. These dedicated professionals have earned the right to be fully compensated in retirement,\" stated Harold A. Schaitberger, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters. \"The International Association of Fire Fighters fully supports the Federal Firefighter Pay Equity Act. On behalf of our federal members, and more than 316,000 professional fire fighters of the IAFF, I want to thank to Representatives Connolly and Walorski for their leadership on this important issue.\"  \"AFGE thanks Congressman Connolly and Congresswoman Walorski for introducing the \"Firefighter Pay Equity Act.\" Federal Firefighters are committed to keeping federal buildings and lands safe and put it all on the line for our safety. They should not be penalized for mandatory overtime. Rather, federal firefighters should be fairly compensated for every hour they are required to work and every hour worked should be accounted for their retirement benefits,\" said American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO National President J. David Cox.  Text of the legislation is available here https://connolly.house.gov/UploadedFiles/Firerighter_Pay_Equity.pdf.

       " 'Wealth Management (A Special Report): Game Plan --- One Man\\'s Quest for Financial Security and Work Flexibility After getting divorced and paying off a sizable amount of credit-card debt, Matthew Barnhart has spent years focusing on his finances. His goal: To be able to turn down work that doesn\\'t appeal to him.  Mr. Barnhart, age 42, works as a mastering engineer at a studio in Chicago, making final adjustments to albums after they\\'ve been recorded and mixed. His flexible schedule allows him to freelance as a tour manager and sound engineer for bands, and to do some work with bands in the recording studio.  \"I don\\'t want to be 50 years old and have to make work decisions that I\\'m unhappy about just in order to feed myself,\" he says.  Mr. Barnhart made about $20,000 as an employee at the mastering studio last year, as well as $18,000 in taxable income from self-employment. He received $6,000 from his mother from money she receives from his deceased father\\'s pension and $2,000 in dividends from taxable stock. Living separately from his girlfriend, Mr. Barnhart has no debt and tries to save 40% to 50% of his income. Last year that meant saving the $20,000 he made at the studio, and living off the rest, around $26,000.  He has $95,000 in a taxable brokerage account, $69,000 in a traditional IRA, $36,000 in an individual 401(k), $10,500 in a Roth IRA and $2,000 in a Simple IRA. He also has $7,500 in a health savings account and roughly $7,500 in a savings account for emergencies.  His total monthly spending is about $2,100. He used to own a home but sees no reason to now.  ADVICE FROM A PRO: Brian D\\'Orazio, a certified financial planner with CliftonLarsonAllen Wealth Advisors in Greenwood Village, Colo., says that if Mr. Barnhart\\'s income keeps up with inflation and there aren\\'t any major changes in variables such as medical coverage, he is on track to be able to retire in his early 60s and be picky about the work he takes later in his career.  Mr. D\\'Orazio says Mr. Barnhart is in a relatively low tax bracket. If he sees that changing -- due to higher earnings or another marriage -- he may want to slowly roll money from his traditional IRA into a Roth IRA. That would allow him to pay taxes on the Roth contributions at the relatively low rate.  Mr. Barnhart hasn\\'t done any estate planning. As such, he should talk to an attorney about a will, power of attorney and a living will, Mr. D\\'Orazio says.  He agrees that owning a home isn\\'t something Mr. Barnhart needs to prioritize. \"If it doesn\\'t align with his personal goals and values, I\\'m not one to argue against that.\"  ---  Mr. Kornelis is a writer in Seattle.

       " \"Don't pay your utility bill on time? You're not alone. Only 2 percent pay theircity bill when it's due. Area's utilities have many different standards for when payments are due Spokane water customers now have twice as long to pay their utility bills after the Spokane City Council stretched the due date by 10 days.  Just 2 percent of Spokane residents pay their water, sewer and trash bills on time. But 62 percent make their monthly payment in the 11- to 20-day window after bills arrive.  City spokeswoman Marlene Feist said people were required to pay their bill 10 days after they were postmarked.  She said the city looked at other utilities in the area, which usually allow people five to 11 days longer than Spokane to pay their bills, when they proposed the new deadlines.  Jim Fields, assistant general manager for Vera Water and Power, the utility that provides electricity to about 12,000 Spokane Valley homes and water to 8,500, said 87 percent of their customers pay on time every month. He said the 13 percent who do pay their bills late are often late every billing cycle.  Andy Barth, a spokesman for Inland Power and Light, which serves about 35,000 customers across 13 Eastern Washington and North Idaho counties, said only 4 percent to 6 percent of their customers pay their bills late. Inland Power bills are due 20 days after they are sent and allow for an additional 10-day grace period before charging a 5 percent fee. The company also charges a $10 disconnection fee and typically will shut off a person's power between 40 to 45 days after the initial bill is sent.  Vera and Inland Power, like other utilities in the area, provide 20 to 30 days before charging a late fee and sending out a shut-off notice. Most companies will shut off power or water after 40 to 45 days of nonpayment.  The city of Spokane will charge a 1 percent late fee 20 days after a bill goes out. When a water user is 30 days past due, they will get a late notice in the next bill, and after 60 days, they will get a delinquency notice. Customers get an additional 10 days before they receive a shut-off warning, and after about 90 days of nonpayment, the city can shut off their water.  Feist said the city can set up payment arrangements or connect people to social service programs if they are having difficulty paying their bill. The city has a UHelp program that assists low-income water users pay their bills, and other community programs such as SNAP assist people with paying their heating and electrical bills during an emergency.  Feist said now that the city has increased the amount of time utility customers have to pay their bill, it can launch its e-billing system that will include an auto-pay option.

We\\'re trying to weigh up the pros and cons of this, apart from the obvious saving on interest and insurance payments.  A Another benefit is you will have more net disposable income to do with as you choose because you won\\'t be making monthly repayments. Something to consider is if you should ever require part or all of the money for other things? Ensure you have access to a sufficient contingency fund.  Q Is there a limit to the number of years I could delay taking my state pension? I\\'ve read somewhere that you can get a higher weekly figure by doing this.  A There is no limit, but you must defer for a minimum of nine weeks. Your state pension will then increase by the equivalent of 1% for every nine weeks you defer. This works out as just under 5.8% for every full year.  Q I keep hearing about credit cards that can help repair a damaged credit rating. Who offers these types of cards and do you have to apply for them online as I don\\'t have access to the internet?  A Firms offering these cards include Capital One and Aqua who seem to prefer online applications. However, Tesco offers The Foundation Credit Card which you can apply for by calling 0345 300 4278.  Q A friend said I should take out a protection policy on my mortgage. I thought payment protection was a bad thing with all the refunds. I am single.  A The refunds are due to mis-selling. A lot of people were sold payment protection insurance on loans and credit cards without actually knowing they were paying for this cover. However, people do need to ensure they have their finances covered by the right type of policy. As a single person with a mortgage you should at least consider mortgage payment protection or income protection, so you have cover should you be unable to work and pay your mortgage because of injury or illness.  Q I\\'ve been divorced for nine years. The bank will not take my ex-partner\\'s name off the loan unless I take out a new deal which would mean I couldn\\'t afford repayments. Any advice? this is often the case.  A Unfortunately, To remove the name, you would have to re-mortgage and then affordability would be calculated on your income only.

       " 'Personal Finance Why the LaGuardia delays may have played a special role in ending the shutdown; Hell hath no fury like a grounded passenger Hell hath no fury like a grounded passenger  Hell hath no fury like a grounded passenger  In our politically fractured country, the (temporary) resolution to the partial federal government shutdown showed there\\'s still one thing Americans can agree on: air travel sucks.  Hours after the New York City\\'s LaGuardia Airport started juggling delays, President Donald Trump said he was agreeing to a deal that re-opened the federal government at least for now.  Coincidence? Maybe not.  The major airport\\'s skeleton staff sluggishness - which was widely covered even on a day when informal Trump advisor Roger Stone was arrested - might have been a potent last straw, experts say.  The woes of air travel resonates with a broad swath of Americans: some 92% said their flying experience \"leaves a lot to be desired\" in a 2017 survey by Airfarewatchdog.com.  Long before federal government funding stopped because of disputes on whether to pay for a wall along the Mexican border, people had little patience for air travel gone wrong, between the prices, crammed seating and long security lines. Those lines grew as the shutdown plodded on.  Stalled airports tend to inspire special fury in the American mind, said Richard Levick, chairman and CEO of LEVICK, who handles public affairs and crisis communications for airlines and major manufacturers.  Levick said that coming 35 days deep into the shutdown, \"LaGuardia became not only a symbol, it became its own cause celebre within the shutdown.\"  The fury over air travel is powerful for the same reason a good joke always gets laughs - \"that is, everyone shares the same experience,\" Levick said.  Folks from all walks of life can commiserate with travel plans ruined or nearly ruined by air travel problems, Levick said.  \"There are very few times where Americans, in fact citizens all over the world, can be easily confused with cattle and that one place is the airport.\"  Kathryn Wylde, president and CEO of the Partnership for New York City, a pro-business nonprofit organization, said LaGuardia\\'s woes were \"the most visible evidence so far\" of the shutdown\\'s effects on the economy - and everyday Americans.  \"When the airport goes down, you know this is affecting not just government employees, it\\'s affecting everyone,\" she said.  Hours before Trump announced the temporary truce, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said the short staffing was \"anything but a sick out - it is only about our safety and the air traffic controllers\\' absolute commitment to it.\"  She continued, \"Do we have your attention now, [Senate Leader Mitch] McConnell?

       " \"Money 'Dodgy builders destroyed my home - then tried to charge me EVEN MORE to fix it' Robert thought the builder he'd chosen was accredited with good reviews - but as he later discovered, it was all completely fake  Having the builders in can be stressful and fraught with difficulties, making it a huge relief when they leave.  But just as you think the worst is over, it may just be starting?  A reader called Robert wrote to me this week about a dispute he is having with a local builder.  In August, Robert engaged a firm to build an extension at the back of his house.  Before choosing his builder, he read up online to find a firm that was accredited, with good reviews.  The one he chose carried good reviews on its website and displayed the Which? Trusted Trader logo, which he took as meaning they had been endorsed by Which?.  Do I need planning permission? What you can build without it, what you can't and how to get it  Robert met with the boss of the building firm and showed him the plans, already approved by the local planning authority.  A quote was provided which Robert accepted, and a few weeks later the works started. All was completed by November.  But this is when the problems started. Robert discovered lots of snagging issues, all which were raised with the building firm.  Their reaction was that they could deal with the issues but there would be an extra fee - and they quoted him £2,890.  Matters got worse as the local authority inspected the extension and found aspects of the work that contravened building regulations.  Robert then presented a list of those issues to the building firm - and they quoted a further £3,450 to deal with them. Robert, from Northampton, has therefore been left with a bill of £6,340? just to put right what the firm got wrong.  How to spot a rogue builder and what to do if you fall victim to one  My first step was to see if the firm really was endorsed by Which? Trusted Traders. A simple search carried out on the Which? website confirmed they were not.  This means Robert was misled into the contract. Under Section 50 of the Consumer Rights Act 2015, the fact that the builder represented that they were a member of an accredited scheme meant that this formed part of the contract.  So the effect of this being untrue is that they are in breach of contract and can be sued.  In these circumstances the CRA says Robert is entitled to have the remedial works carried out for free or to have a price reduction.  The firm also clearly failed to carry out the works with reasonable care and skill, as the CRA requires.  So happily, the law is firmly on Robert's side - but for anyone looking to engage a trader, do fully check out all their credentials before agreeing anything with them.  Consumer rights\",\n",
       " 'Retirement Matters Opinion CPP looks like a ponzi scheme Last April I wrote a column about our government sponsored retirement pension plan known as the Canada Pension Plan (CPP).  In that column I wrote about the steps I took to calculate what a taxpayer could expect to pay into the program, what his employer would contribute, and what he could expect in return. I was prompted to delve into the subject after reading an article in an on line chat room. After crunching the numbers, I concluded that, in my humble opinion, the CPP is a giant ponzi scheme. It appears that lots of other Canadians share my view, and that recent media attention to the subject must have caught the attention of the folks running the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.  As you may know, the federal government has mandated increases in the CPP payments for employees and employers as of Jan. 1. These increases, along with plenty of media attention, has resulted in the CPPIB starting a PR campaign which includes spending hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on advertizing. That\\'s right, instead of looking inward to make this system more equitable for all concerned, they are burning cash to tell us how great they are. In my opinion, this approach to criticism is just as worthless as the constant deluge of advertisements telling us how wonderful the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation is at \"protecting\" your GICs.  Getting back to CPP, I find it absolutely outrageous that when you pass on to the next experience, your \"investment\" in CPP contributions, along with your employer\\'s, disappears into this bottomless pit. Yes, your spouse will receive a small portion of your benefit for life, but the capital eventually disappears. CPP talking heads would likely say that they also provide a disability benefit to those who become disabled which converts to a regular pension when they reach age 65.  And since disabled people will no longer be paying into the system, they have to factor that drain into their calculations. This argument may have held water 20 years ago, but the truth is that back then, CPP was handing out lifetime disability pensions with gay abandon. When they caught on to the reality that some folks would line up to receive free money without working for it, they changed the definition of disability to read: Prolonged and severe disability likely to result in death. Sorry, your sore back won\\'t cut it anymore.  The current reality is that someone who is given a CPP disability pension these days has an extremely limited life span, so they will likely not be a drag on the system for a long time.  In my opinion, it\\'s time for CPP to stop building an empire and return the cash to those who paid into the system.

       " \"Bill breaks losing streak on the water Seven boats competed for Nowra Community Sailing Club's heat eight of the Bomaderry Bowling Club Point Score and enjoyed a shifting south easterly around five to twelve knots and a strong outgoing tide.  This meant mostly reaching legs with some works as the breeze shifted, and beautiful flat water.  The start was extremely tight with Richard Pryor first over the start line by less than a metre from Merve Lotze, Bill Jauncey, Wayne Norris, Steve Phelps, Michael Fairbairn and Mike Wootten.  The breeze swung more to the east for the quick tide assisted leg to the windward mark, and Michael's Finn took most of the leg to get clear of the six Spiral class dinghies who were fighting hard for buoy room rights at the mark.  On the reach back to the west mark near the bridges, Michael finally got clear of the Spirals with Merve about a length ahead of Wayne, then a small gap back to Steve, Bill, Richard and Mike.  On the next lap Bill managed to just get ahead of Steve while Richard was back winded in a failing gust, pirouetted the boat, then capsized, with the final ignominy of being hit by his boom as he fell in the river.  Mike was quick to take advantage of Richard's rather spectacular misfortune and moved up to sixth place, while Bill called for an action replay.  By the sixth lap Wayne had passed Merve and was clearly in second place while Merve began to fall back to the brawl for fourth place between Bill and Steve, with Bill almost catching Merve, only to see Merve's skill come to the fore as he caught a gust which Bill missed, and got clear.  This order continued to the finish with Michael's Finn crossing the line five minutes ahead of Wayne with Merve 46 seconds back in third.  Less than two minutes later came Bill with Steve only eighteen seconds behind him, about the greatest distance they were apart for the whole race. Mike came next with Richard just twenty one seconds behind him.  For the Bomaderry Bowling Club Point Score the times are corrected by personal handicaps and for this heat the old bloke Bill snatched first by just nine seconds from Wayne who beat Steve by five seconds.  Merve grabbed fourth by fifteen seconds from Richard with Michael Fairbairn over a minute back for sixth and Mike 41 seconds behind him for seventh.  For this win Bill drops three minutes from his handicap, Wayne two, and Steve one. Merve stays the same and the rest of the fleet gains a minute, so Bill, Wayne and Steve will have a real task to repeat their good places this coming weekend.  This Saturday we race for heat nine of the Bomaderry Bowling Club Point Score, and heat seven of the Championship.  We are expecting visitors from Jervis Bay Sailing Club and other visitors are most welcome. Start as usual at 14.15.\",\n",

Linda and Dave Lloyd, who live in Walsall Road in Birmingham, have a 31-year-old son, Daniel, with autism and severe learning difficulties who requires round-the-clock care from healthcare professionals.  He receives several visits a day from healthcare workers, who use the hard shoulder outside the home for parking.  However, under proposals for the new £110 million Sprint bus service, the hard shoulder that so many residents and businesses rely on along the Walsall Road would be removed to make way for a bus lane. The proposals have been the subject of much controversy, with claims from residents that they were not properly consulted. It is something the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) denies.  The WMCA has now revealed it would be considering alterations to the proposals after receiving feedback.  However, Mrs Lloyd says that if the original proposals go ahead and the hard shoulder is removed, the family will be forced to sell up so Daniel can continue to receive care.  \"We\\'ve lived here for 34 years, and if it goes ahead then we\\'ve got to put our house up for sale,\" she says. \"The Sprint bus is going to happen anyway, but it\\'s the way that it\\'s going to be put along the road that\\'s the problem for us.  \"It\\'s going to take away the parking outside the house, which is going to be very inconvenient for the residents. \"We\\'ve got a drive, but because we\\'ve got Daniel we have to have carers that come during the day that take him out, or come and stay so we can go out, because he\\'s 24/7. So if two carers come, where are they going to park? \"Now because my son has got both autism and severe learning difficulties, and he\\'s got anxiety, they have to stop outside the house. He\\'s got no awareness of danger so for me, to bring the bus lane nearer to the house, it\\'s incredibly dangerous. I have said to them that I\\'ll hold them fully responsible if anything happens to my son. We definitely will have to move house.\" The WMCA claims an exhaustive consultation took place on all of the Sprint bus routes, with those households affected leafleted.  A spokesman for WMCA said: \"We urge the family to get in touch with us so we can look at the specific circumstances and seek to address their concerns.  \"During our consultation the loss of on-street parking was a key issue for some residents and businesses. As a result we have committed to look at this again as we develop our plans for Sprint on the A34.\"',\n",

The securitization received AAA ratings from Moody\\'s and DBRS, continuing the company\\'s track record of AAA-rated transactions.  The transaction was CommonBond\\'s eighth and brings the company\\'s total securitized loan amount to approximately $2.0 billion. Goldman Sachs served as structuring agent, co-lead manager, book-runner, and co-sponsor for this securitization. Barclays, Citi, and Guggenheim Securities also served as co-lead managers and book-runners on the transaction.  The structure included a unique feature called \"prefunding,\" which enables CommonBond to add loans to the securitization after its close. CommonBond is the first private lender to prefund a student loan refinance securitization in the modern financial era. CommonBond prefunded approximately $80 million worth of loans as part of the deal.  \"Pre-funding allows us to provide investors with more size and certainty, while at the same time add flexibility to our own funding model, in a way that is differentiated from others in the market,\" said David Klein, CommonBond CEO and co-founder. \"This is a key milestone in our securitization program, and powers even more liquidity in the name, stability in the program, and consistency in performance.\"  This securitization marks continued growth for CommonBond, which will originate more than $1 billion in 2018. The company has raised $3 billion in debt funding and more than $130 million in equity to date. Its customer acquisition costs remain a fraction of industry peers, its credit quality remains best in class, and the company has been profitable for three of the last six quarters. CommonBond is one of TIME magazine\\'s 2018 50 Genius Companies, and Fast Company\\'s World\\'s 50 Most Innovative Companies 2018. To fuel its continued expansion, in December 2018 the company acquired NextGenVest, an AI-powered financial platform for Generation Z.

Some 10.1 million shoppers will visit the beleaguered high street to spend £1.38 billion on gifts and festive food and drink, while 4.8 million will spend £268 million online in the hope that their purchases can be delivered on time, according to predictions by VoucherCodes.co.uk and the Centre for Retail Research.  The anticipated rush should provide a fillip after a disappointing weekend for retailers with gales, snow and freezing rain brought by Storm Deirdre blamed for lower shopper numbers.  Combined footfall for high streets, retail parks and shopping centres was down 4.3% on the same weekend last year, according to retail intelligence experts Springboard.  Online sales are expected to peak the day before on \\'Frenzied Friday\\' as 7.2 million shoppers spend £321 million on last-minute gifts.  Laura Ashley 40 new store closures update - what we know about the shops closing  Footfall is expected to be up 20% on the daily average on Super Saturday, while Sunday and Christmas Eve are anticipated to both be up by 5%, according to retail analysts ShopperTrak.  ShopperTrak UK director Steve Richardson said: \"As the last working day for many before Christmas, Frenzied Friday marks the start of the last-minute festive footfall rush, with footfall set to rise across the weekend.  \"Friday is also significant in that it marks the moment that shoppers move away from buying online and instead head into stores to finish off Christmas shopping.  \"In spite of retailers offering later and later fulfilment options, shoppers will head on to the high street, fuelled by the fear that online gifts may not arrive in time for the big day, as well as taking advantage of click-and-collect orders, which some retailers are promising to fulfil on Christmas Eve itself.\"  Gift cards could be the worst present possible - your rights if things go wrong  The UK high street has been hit hard this year as several large companies entered administration including House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, which were both bought by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley.  Names such as Toys R Us UK, Poundworld and electronic retailer Maplin also fell into administration, while fashion chain New Look, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams all announced store closures.  Jimmy New, director of marketing at VoucherCodes, said: \"Super Saturday will be a big shopping day for both retailers and consumers alike as millions flock to stores looking to snap up last-minute gifts and other essentials before Christmas Day.  \"It\\'ll certainly be one of the busiest shopping days on the high street so, if you do brave the shops, expect crowds.\"  Christmas food and drink',\n",

BlackRock has inked its biggest technology partnership yet, aiming to help Americans save for retirement.  The firm is working with Microsoft to build a platform for retirement savings that will launch next year, the world\\'s largest asset manager said Thursday. Spokespeople for Microsoft and BlackRock declined further comment.  The product, which will be offered through employers, is still under development, a source with knowledge of the platform said. It\\'s designed to be user-friendly, with a goal of being as intuitive as ride-hailing application Uber.  The idea stemmed from a conversation earlier this year between BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which the executives discussed creative ways for companies to address America\\'s retirement crisis. Last year, Fink called the problems associated with longevity \"one of the greatest financial challenges faced by our clients today.\"  About 40% of Americans said they are not confident they will have enough money in retirement, according to a Wells Fargo survey last month.  BlackRock currently oversees about $1 trillion in defined contribution assets, out of $6.4 trillion total assets under management. The firm is eyeing growth in the space as more private and public employers move away from pricier pensions to cheaper definied contribution plans, in which employees contribute a portion of their paycheck toward retirement.  BlackRock and Microsoft\\'s product will first be available in the US before potentially rolling out to other regions. Through the platform, BlackRock plans to offer new investment options, such as annuities, which provide a regular stream of income in retirement.  The firm\\'s head of Americas, Mark McCombe, is leading the effort for BlackRock. A spokesman for Microsoft declined to identify the technology company\\'s internal leader.

       " 'World news Canada pension fund investment into US detention firm larger than reported CPPIB holds $6.1m in investments in Geo Group, a firm that runs US detention facilities under Trump\\'s immigration crackdown  A controversial investment by one of Canada\\'s biggest pension funds in a company which operates private prisons in the United States is larger than initially thought, recent securities filings have revealed.  The Guardian and Documented  reported last month that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) - which manages $366.6bn in pension funds on behalf of some 20 million Canadian retirees - holds stock in Geo Group.  But the most recent regulatory filings show the CPPIB has added to its holdings in Geo Group by 90,000 shares since June - an increase of nearly 50% - bringing the total investment value to $6.1m. It is not known if the fund still holds the shares; the investment board did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Facilities operated by Geo Group have been used in recent months to detain families in the United States, following Donald Trump\\'s \"zero tolerance\" crackdown on immigration by the American government.  Meanwhile, the CPPIB decreased its holdings of CoreCivic, another private prison company, by 5,900 shares, valuing the investment at $1.65m at the time of filing.  The CPPIB is one of the largest funds in the world, and although the investments in American private prisons companies represent a narrow slice of the overall fund, they have prompted an angry reaction from campaign groups and politicians.  \"I\\'m very surprised to hear that number is significantly higher than we had previously thought,\" said Emma Pullman of SumOfUs, an advocacy group that started one of two online , an advocacy group that started one of two petitions     calling on the fund to divest its holdings. Between them, the two petitions have received more than 45,000 signatures.  Selling the investment would mark a significant move for the CPPIB, which prides itself in resisting external lobbying attempts.  But public outcry appears to have rattled the board. On 14 November, the board convened a meeting with activists from two separate groups, both petitioning the investment board to divest its holdings.  \"I think the reason they\\'re looking into these options is because the writing is on the wall,\" said Logan McIntosh, a campaigner with the Leadnow advocacy group, who attended the meeting. \"It\\'s an unnecessary and shameful investment and it\\'s undermining the confidence of Canadians that they can manage our retirement savings responsibly.\"  Every two years, the CPPIB hosts legally mandated presentations across the country to outline its investment strategy and allow the public to ask questions.  \"I don\\'t think Canadians are interested in profiting from the abuse of humans and the caging of children,\" said Darcie Lanthier, a former financial advisor who attended one such event in Charlottetown. \"I know, with what little savings I have, I go out of my way to ensure my investments are doing no harm.\"',\n",
       " 'Portman Applauds House Passage of Coast Guard Reauthorization Bill to Help Protect Great Lakes; Portman Effort Creates New Approach for Regulating Ballast Water Discharge for Vessels; Sen. Portman, Rob - (R - OH) News Release WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), co-chair of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, today applauded the U.S. House of Representatives for passing the Frank Lobiondo Coast Guard Authorization Act (S. 140), which includes language he negotiated to establish a rulemaking framework for vessel discharge regulations to ensure the Great Lakes are protected against pollution and the spread of invasive species while creating regulatory certainty for the competitive shipping industry across the region. The Senate passed the bill with a bipartisan vote of 94-6 on November 14, 2018.  \"This bill will both protect the Great Lakes against the spread of invasive species and pollution and ensure that our shipping industry in Ohio and across the Great Lakes is competitive,\" said Portman. \"I am proud that we worked together in a bipartisan way to find a balanced legislative solution to ensure the regulations regarding vessel discharges will protect the ecosystem in the Great Lakes.\"  NOTE: The Vessel Incidental Discharge Act (VIDA) establishes a framework for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Coast Guard to establish national ballast water and incidental discharge rules. Currently, discharges are regulated through different state permits under Section 402 of the Clean Water Act, creating a patchwork of state permit requirements in 26 states. Under the bill, the EPA will have the lead role in establishing national standards for discharges, while the Coast Guard will have the primary role for monitoring and enforcing these standards and ensuring vessel safety. These regulations will help prevent pollution and ensure that ballast water does not transport invasive species from one body of water to another along a vessel\\'s shipping route, while providing greater regulatory certainty for the shipping industry across the Great Lakes region. The bill also provides states with robust opportunities to participate in the standard setting process and to ensure compliance when the regulations are implemented.  The bill also contains policies that Senators Portman and Stabenow and other Senators in the region secured specifically for the Great Lakes basin. This includes:  * Allowing Great Lakes states to cooperatively establish unique and more stringent ballast water standards or best management practice (BMP) for vessels traveling in the Great Lakes.  * Authorizing $50 million annually for a new program within the EPA\\'s Great Lakes National Program Office. This program will enable funding to be provided to monitor for and respond to outbreaks of aquatic invasive species in the Great Lakes and to help develop new ballast control technologies for vessels in the Great Lakes.  * Authorizing $5 million per year for the Great Lakes Commission to be a convener on ballast water discharge regulations, of which all Great Lakes States and Canada are represented.

       " 'News Small funds eat away at super: report Australians are bleeding tens of thousands of dollars in retirement savings each because regulators have failed to weed out small, high-cost funds, a Productivity Commission analysis has found.  If the 50 smallest high-cost super funds were forced to merge into the top 10 biggest low-cost funds, there would be an average boost to the retirement nest eggs of Australia\\'s 14.8 million super account holders of $22,000 each if cost savings from bigger economies of scale were passed on as fee reductions. Australians are collectively shelling out $30 billion a year in fees on their superannuation accounts, not including insurance premiums. Retirees now fork out more in super fees each year than power bills, a recent Grattan Institute report found.  According to a supplementary paper to the Productivity Commission\\'s major superannuation inquiry, released today, members would reap \"significant\" savings if more were transferred into larger, low-cost funds.  It finds \"clear evidence\" that bigger funds enjoy \"economies of scale\" - the ability to manage member funds at a lower average cost: \"Average administration expenses are typically lower in larger funds.\" There has been a wave of consolidation among super funds, with 350 funds disappearing or merging between mid-2006 and mid-2016. But 93 super funds still exist - a mix of retail and industry - which individually manage less than $1 billion of member funds, meaning members do not enjoy the same economies of scale in administration and management fees as bigger funds.  The commission\\'s paper also finds that the lack of real competition in the super industry means: \"There is little evidence that scale benefits have been systematically passed through to members in the form of lower fees.  \"Despite the realisation of economies of scale since 2004, the reduction in fees charged to members by the median fund did not fall.\"  In its draft report in May, the commission estimated potential savings of about $600,000 in retirement for a member with multiple poorly performing accounts who consolidated them into the best performing fund.  The system-wide savings of rolling the 50 highest cost funds into the 10 lowest cost funds amount to $1.8 billion in total, or $22,000 spread across all account holders. \"Gains to members of higher cost funds would be markedly larger,\" the paper finds.  The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority - which is set to appear before the royal commission on Friday - has had for some time a responsibility to apply a \"scale test\", to close down funds which are too small to be in members\\' best interests.  But this test \"has proven inadequate in protecting default members from poorly performing funds\", the Productivity Commission found in its draft report.  The government has drafted legislation proposing the scale test be replaced by a broader \"outcomes test\".  The Productivity Commission wants this test made tougher.  Not so super  Two million accounts - 8 per cent of all member accounts - are invested in small, high-cost funds.',\n",

       " 'Business Millions at risk due to homes debt time bomb Your Money Edited by Harvey Jones email: harvey.jones@express.co.uk  GROWING numbers of people face the prospect of losing their home later in life because they cannot afford to clear their mortgage before they retire.  Three million fear they will not be able to pay it off in time, while six out of ten said they do not even have a plan for paying off the debt.  More than a quarter say the thought of having a mortgage after 65 makes them feel anxious, according to research from online mortgage broker L&C Mortgages.  Most lenders will not extend mortgages beyond 65 or 70 and those who can\\'t get a new deal risk losing their home as a result.  LIFETIME DEBT One in three homeowners expect to be paying their mortgage beyond 65, while one in 10 think they will never be mortgage free.  L&C mortgage specialist David Hollingworth said the trend will worsen as more buyers increasingly take the first step onto the property ladder later in life.  \"They must also take out a larger mortgage to keep up with high house prices,\" he added.  This is a major concern as many people will see their incomes dip after they retire, which means they could struggle to afford their repayments, he explained.  Some lenders are responding by offering innovative deals for older borrowers although you have to prove you can afford the mortgage, Hollingworth said.  \"Rather than suffering in silence, speak to someone who can help you explore the market and find a solution that works for you,\" he said.  SOLUTIONS Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said options include downsizing to a cheaper property: \"With luck this will clear the mortgage and ideally free up some cash to pay off other debts.\"  He added that over 55s with pension pots could use their 25 per cent taxfree lump sum to clear debts: \"You can draw the rest of your pension too, but it is liable to income tax, so take care.\"  Harris said that specialist or regional lenders will lend into your 80s or 90s, including The Family Building Society.  \"Some don\\'t state a maximum age, including Loughborough, Cambridge and Bath building societies,\" he said.  Considering your mortgage will still have a fixed end date and you must show you can afford repayments.  SWEET RELEASE Harris said residential interest-only mortgages from the likes of Bath and Vernon building societies are worth considering. \"These are available to borrowers aged 55-plus, subject to an affordability assessment, with the debt repaid on a specified life event, such as death or moving into long-term care.\"  Seek financial advice as these options could impact your tax status and means-tested state benefits, he added.  Dean Mirfin, chief product officer at equity release adviser Key, said 30 per cent of its customers use some of the money to pay off debt in retirement.',\n",

Trusts allow a trusted family member or friend to quickly access your assets and keep status quo. Status quo in an emergency can be invaluable. \"With a trust, a person that you choose can step in and make sure immediate issues like mortgage payments, insurance payments, or other bills are taken care if you are incapacitated or worse. With a trust you can lay out a long-term plan to financially provide for your children if the unthinkable occurs. Trusts can help make things much easier on your loved ones,\" added Wright.  No. 3: Sit down with an experienced attorney. \"If you don\\'t have an estate plan, get it done! Find an attorney that will take the time to explain and discuss your options without making you feel like you are imposing. And, if you have an estate plan, you should review your estate planning documents with your attorney every three to five years, or upon important life-changing events,\" concluded Wright. \"This includes marriage, divorce, death, or birth of a child or grandchild.\"  About Philip Wright, Wright Law Firm, LC  Philip Wright focuses on probate, will, trust and estate law.

       " 'Five asset managers achieve Gold Standard Awards 2018; Revealed - successes across all 11 categories Five fund groups picked up a coveted Gold Standard award at a ceremony in the House of Commons on 14 November, including Hargreaves Lansdown, which was successful across five different categories.  The Bristol-based financial services giant was adjudged by the nine-strong panel of industry experts to have achieved the Gold Standard for Fund Management (Retail), Portfolio Management Services, Group Pensions, Personal Pensions and Retirement. The full Roll of Honour for the 2018 Gold Standard Awards can be seen below.  Joining the firm in theFund Management (Retail) grouping were BlackRock and Neptune Investment Management, whileHermes Investment Management andSantander Asset Management UK achieved the Gold Standard in theFund Management (Institutional) category.  Now in their 16th year, the Gold Standard Awards recognise financial services companies that go the extra mile to serve their customers and build confidence in the sector - rewarding businesses that display consistent standards of excellence in service, capability, trust, financial strength and fair value.  Presenting the Awards yesterday,Investment Week Events chairman Julian Marr said: \"The Gold Standard Awards were created in 2003 as a benchmark of quality in financial services - and entrants either meet the standard or they do not. As both our judging panel and 2018\\'s successful entrants are keenly aware, consumer confidence can take years to build but it can be lost in a moment.\"  Rather than measure a single aspect of a business, the Gold Standard Awards assess a wide range of key areas including financial strength, ability to conduct business, service excellence, fair value and trust. They also take into account a company\\'s ability to promote confidence through the customer experience, as well as levels of corporate governance and social responsibility.  Chaired by Aviva head of marketing Rosy Anand, the judging panel also comprised Bakehouse Communications managing director Nick Baker; Financial Marketing managing director Chris Harvey; Bravura Solutions business development manager Natanje Holt; Asset Risk Consultants director of research Daniel Hurdley; Fairstone Group non-executive director Malcolm Kerr; Unique Financial Planning managing director Philip Martin; Technology & Technical managing director Kim North; and Psigma Investment Management marketing director Sara Walsh.

       " 'News Install a dashcam to get 10% off premium, says car insurer A CAR insurance company is offering drivers a 10% discount on their premium if they install a dash cam.  The use of dash-cam footage of accidents has become common when establishing who was at fault in a crash, and footage of road incidents is often used by gardaí investigating what happened.  AXA Insurance is offering a 10% discount on its premiums if a driver installs a Nextbase dash cam in their car. A typical premium is around ?600, so a 10% discount would be worth ?60 - enough to buy a basic camera.  AXA director Antoinette McDonald said: \\'Unfortunately, motor collisions are a regular occurrence on Irish roads and it is often the case when settling these claims that witness accounts may not exist or may vary, or it can take time to obtain Garda evidence.  \\'Dash cams offer a great way for drivers to get extra peace of mind when they are on the road.\\' Nextbase director Richard Browning said dash cams make drivers \\'feel more secure when driving, be it for a quick trip to the shops, picking up the kids after school or a big road trip\\'.  \\'This partnership with AXA is the first of its kind in Ireland and will establish these devices as essential for careful and responsible drivers,\\' he said.  \\'It offers the opportunity for drivers to save money on their insurance and protect themselves in the event of an incident.\\' Nextbase will also match the offer with its own 10% discount on its cameras.  FBD Insurance is also offering a ?50 discount on premiums if a driver has a dash cam fitted.  Dash cams are legal, and the evidence recorded can be used in court, provided the owner will testify that the recording is theirs. The AA recommends using them as a way of settling claims and establishing an incident\\'s cause.  Insurance expert Jonathan Hehir said: \\'If there are fraudulent claims, a dash cam or CCTV evidence will certainly help, if you can play footage in front of a judge and say, \"I hit X at whatever kph and there it is there\".  \\'It also can help a judge to decide if the injuries aren\\'t real. We often come across cases where somebody might say a person just braked in front of them, just hit the brakes for no reason. They say, \"No, I didn\\'t, you just ran into back of me\". If you have a dash cam it can certainly help mitigate things and show who is at fault.\\' A Garda spokesman said: \\'It\\'s like CCTV: if someone has footage of an incident, it\\'s welcomed.\\' A recent study in Britain revealed a quarter of motorists believe having a dash cam improves their driving. It also found 69% of those involved in an accident believe a dash cam would have been useful in settling any insurance claim.  christian.mccashin@dailymail.ie  Footage can be used in court',\n",
       " 'Money LITTLE STAR Sainsbury\\'s Christmas advert 2018 may bring a tear to your eye Little girl Tia is terrified to perform in front of many people, but with a bit of encouragement from her mum, she gives all she\\'s got and puts on an amazing show with her friends  SAINSBURY\\'s has released its Christmas advert for 2018 - and it\\'s actually super cute.  It features eight-year-old Tia and her school friends putting up a play for their parents, which is a complete change from last year.  Last year\\'s Sainsbury\\'s ad didn\\'t have a narrative and instead celebrated the many ways the Brits spend the festive season.  This year\\'s \"The Big Night\" advert, which will air tonight during a break of Coronation Street on at 7.15 on ITV - and it could be one of the most heartwarming ads we\\'ve seen yet.  It starts off in black-and-white before Tia appears on stage dressed as a star, but she\\'s really nervous to perform in front of a hall full of people.  But as she catches her mother in the eye, she gets encouraged and carries on singing the 90s banger \\'You Get What You Give\\' by the New Radicals louder and louder.  As she carries on singing, more children also join her on stage and they\\'re wearing costumes ranging from turkeys and baubles to the Queen.  The performance in the ad even involves a set of fairy lights, including the plug, which turns on the festive lights.  During the performance a Christmas tree pops up in the background and the children are giving their all to give their parents a good show.  In the end star Tia is lifted to the top of the tree and there\\'s an explosion of colours as the audience bursts out in cheers and applauds.  The notion that \"we give all we\\'ve got for the ones we love\" is the heart of the new campaign, as the supermarket calls on the nation to do just that this Christmas.  Observant viewers may remember that John Lewis\\' September advert which also included a school play, and it made its viewers dream of Christmas.  This ad was a celebration of the rebrand the department store chain has undergone recently.  But Sainsbury\\'s says that it started planning this year\\'s Christmas advert already in January.  A lot of retailers have already released their Christmas adverts, but some viewers are disappointed while many are still waiting for the highly anticipated John Lewis Christmas advert.  Meanwhile, Iceland\\'s advert was banned from TV before it even aired because it was ruled to be too political.  We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online Money team?

       " 'OPINION FEWER GRADS ISN\\'T UW\\'S ONLY PROBLEM I appreciated the State Journal\\'s thoughtful article, \"Colleges marketing to fewer state graduates,\" about the challenges of the demographic downturn facing Wisconsin.  But I think the Nov. 2 front page piece missed several important points. First, the UW System budget cuts were not only the result of the Republican- run Legislature. To characterize them as that is inaccurate and unfair.  The recent cuts actually followed devastating cuts imposed by Democrat Gov. Jim Doyle, and then further reductions by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. In fact, the Republican-controlled Legislature led by Assembly Speaker Robin Voss, a former student Regent, rejected a significant portion of Walker\\'s proposed cuts. Voss, R-Rochester, in particular vigorously opposed the last cuts Walker proposed almost immediately after the governor announced them.  Many more Wisconsin students are now choosing to go out of state because of perceived quality declines at all UW System institutions, including UW-Madison. Madison has been the victim of faculty recruiting drives by both public and private campuses. Many well-known members of the faculty have left. This makes the enrollment crisis more severe.  Second, Wisconsin\\'s private institutions face a competitive disadvantage because Wisconsin\\'s college student aid program is far short of what other states offer. Wisconsin cannot expect its fine private schools to thrive until it sharply increases its student financial aid program.  I served for a decade on the Finance Committee of Edgewood College, so I saw firsthand the challenges the fine institution faces because student financial aid was not a state priority. The private institutions are very important to the long-term health of Wisconsin. We neglect them at our peril.  Third, high school students leave because of a lack of competitive- salaried job opportunities in Wisconsin. Many Wisconsin employers do not offer market-competitive salaries, and high-school students are well aware of this. Minnesota employers actually recruit Wisconsin high-school students to highly paid internships when they make their initial University of Minnesota campus visit.  Minnesota employers also discuss long-term employment opportunities with these high school students during special Wisconsin Day weekend recruitment programs on the Twin City campus. These Saturdays in Minnesota focus entirely on recruiting high achieving Wisconsin high school students. I attended two of these impressive events as a parent, as have thousands of Wisconsin parents.  Wisconsin must recognize as a state it is in a fierce competitive economic environment. State government and many of its employers, other than Epic in Verona and new technology firms, have failed to recognize that. While demographics are destiny, the failure to compete with other states is equally important.  CREDIT: DAVID W.

       " 'Money Fake poppy sellers caught cashing in on the anniversary of WW1 - and the money is going to anything but charity Members of the public are being told to be extra vigilant when buying merchandise this year - with fraudsters using the anniversary to raise money to fund organised crime  The public have been warned to watch out for fake poppy sellers cashing in on the anniversary of the end of the First World War.  The City of London Police\\'s Intellectual Property Crime Unit (PIPCU)said it\\'s uncovered a number of charity impersonators selling merchandise ahead of Remembrance Day.  Instead of this money being passed on to the Armed Forces and servicemen in need through the Royal British Legion, it\\'s lining the pockets of criminals. This can then be used to fund anything from flash cars to organised crime.  City of London said it\\'s seized goods from a number of addresses where online sellers have been flogging counterfeit scarves and more merchandise.  While this does not include traditional paper poppies, it has included costume jewellery broaches.  Last autumn, Border Force officers intercepted a shipment of poppy merchandise intended for the UK worth in the region of £150,000.  Why James McClean won\\'t wear Remembrance poppy as Stoke winger issues statement  The Intellectual property Office is now warning the members of the public should be extra vigilant when buying merchandise this year.  Not only are these items unapproved counterfeits, not a penny of the money raised is going to charity.  Their donations are intended to support Armed Forces community men, women, veterans and their families but are instead funding fraudsters.  \"It is truly shocking that anyone would target and exploit one of the UK\\'s most cherished charities and take advantage of public support for our Armed Forces,\" said Intellectual Property Minister Sam Gyimah.  \"Together we can ensure donations go to the people they are intended for, by only supporting approved merchandise. Be vigilant when you are buying your poppies this year, and look out for the Royal British Legion logo to ensure the merchandise is approved and genuine.\"  Claire Rowcliffe, from The Royal British Legion, said: \"We would urge everyone wishing to purchase a Remembrance poppy brooch, to do so through official channels. For example, you can buy from one of our trusted volunteers, from The Royal British Legion\\'s online Poppy Shop, or from one of our corporate partners.  \"We would urge anyone purchasing a poppy to buy through official Royal British Legion channels.\"  The public are being asked to look out for counterfeit goods in the shape, or bearing the image of, the British Legion\\'s familiar two-petal red poppy, or Poppy Scotland\\'s four-petal poppy in Scotland.

       " 'ICMA-RC Client, Monroe County, NY, Receives NAGDCA Leadership Recognition Award (GlobeNewswire) - Monroe County, a longtime ICMA-RC client in New York, was recently awarded a NAGDCA 2018 Leadership Recognition Award, which recognizes excellence and innovation in retirement plan design, participant education, technology, and/or effective communication methods in government defined contribution plans.  The Monroe County Deferred Compensation Plan received the recognition following the launch of its first annual VIP Retirement Dinner in 2017 to engage high-balance retirement plan participants who retired or were no longer working for the county. After analyzing participant data for trends and opportunities to better serve participants, it was determined that a significant portion of Monroe Countys retirement plan assets were held by high-balance separated/retired participants over the age of 50. The goal of the VIP dinner was to educate participants about the benefits of the plan and examine their individual goals and retirement needs. The event contributed to a 17 percent decrease in roll-outs, a 33 percent increase in roll-ins and a plan retention rate of 96.3 percent, which represents more than a .5 percent increase from 2016.  Our inaugural VIP Retirement Dinner in 2017 encouraged attendees to become more involved and better informed about their retirement options and it produced strong measurable results, said Brayton Connard, Director of Human Resources for Monroe County. We received very encouraging feedback and engagement from attendees, making it a win-win for those who were involved and we anticipate making this an annual event for the foreseeable future.  The one-night event included a cocktail hour, formal dinner, and presentations from featured speakers. The attendees had the opportunity to interact with the Deferred Compensation Committee, Plan Investment Consultant, ICMA-RC, and the 457 Plan Education Team. One-on-one discussions focusing on the benefits of their 457 plan throughout retirement gave attendees a better understanding of their retirement needs and how to reach their goals.  ICMA-RC applauds Monroe Countys innovative approach and the effort they made to carry out a productive event for their retirement plan participants, said Joseph Teague, Managing Vice President, Field Sales & Relationship Management for ICMA-RC. We were pleased to support their efforts by providing resources that helped attendees think about retirement in new ways.  About ICMA-RC  Founded in 1972, ICMA-RC is a non-profit, independent financial services corporation with approximately $55 billion in assets under management and administration (as of September 30, 2018), focused on providing retirement plans and related services for over a million public sector participant accounts. ICMA-RCs mission is to help public sector employees build retirement security. The organizations mission is delivered through its RealizeRetirement approach in which ICMA-RC representatives actively engage participants in their retirement programs, help them build their asset base, and help them realize their retirement goals through a comprehensive retirement planning strategy.

       " 'News; Teasers MARKET MOVER PAUL O\\'BRIEN Paul O\\'Brien is head of investments at Goodbody Asset Management in Dublin. He leads the team that manages the Goodbody Dividend Income 4 (GDI 4) fund, which is an actively managed multi-asset fund invested in a diversified mix of traditional asset classes. The fund is available to investors through New Ireland Assurance.  Fund philosophy The GDI 4 fund employs an active approach to asset allocation, investment selection and risk management. Typically, high-quality global dividend growth companies account for 70% of the fund, with the remaining 30% diversified across a mix of lower-risk asset classes including government and corporate bonds, property, cash deposits and gold. \"Importantly, the investment team has the flexibility to tactically manage the equity mix in a range of 55%-85%,\" says O\\'Brien. \"In addition, a risk management overlay is used to dampen the volatility of the equity exposure, helping to smooth the returns journey for investors.\"  Performance GDI 4 is among the top-performing multi-asset funds available on the Irish market during 2018, over oneand two-year periods. As of the end of September, it is up 16% since its launch in March 2016, ahead of its benchmark, which is up 10%.  Buying and selling Recent equity market turbulence gave the fund an attractive opportunity to add a new position in global cosmetics company L\\'Oréal to its global dividend equity exposure.  \"The company offers exposure to the structural growth of the global beauty market, supported by a growing middle class and a high propensity among consumers to trade up,\" says O\\'Brien, pictured.  \"L\\'Oréal boasts a high-quality brand portfolio including Lancôme, Maybelline and Garnier, which underpins strong pricing power, high profit margins and future dividend growth prospects. It exemplifies the type of high-quality dividend growth companies held in the fund.\"  The fund also sold out of its entire Italian bond holdings earlier this year, preferring to be positioned in other countries in Europe, including France, Holland and Spain.  \"We took a view that the returns on offer in Italian bonds weren\\'t sufficient to compensate the fund for the risk associated with the new political landscape and fiscal position of the country,\" says O\\'Brien.  He also highlights the fact that the fund\\'s bond exposure is all investment grade, eurodenominated and short duration, which in his view \"reduces the risk associated with rising global interest rates/ bonds yields\".  Outlook O\\'Brien acknowledges that global investment markets have delivered strong returns since the global financial crisis and that the magnitude of returns in the next few years will likely be lower.  That said, despite expecting a pick-up in volatility in the future, he is upbeat on the fund\\'s ability to continue delivering solid returns over the medium/long term \"while the environment is now becoming more late cycle, the global economic backdrop is solid, corporate profitability is still forecast to expand again in 2019, and while equity valuations have become more reasonable\".',\n",

The single ticket holder in South Carolinahas won thelargest lottery jackpot ever in the Mega Millions draw.  Mega Millions is played in 44 US states and costs about $2 to play, although your odds of actually winning are almost non-existent- about 1 in 302 million.  As the mystery jackpot winner thinks about how to splash the cash, we take a look back at how past winners have spent their money:  Build a waterpark  Husband and wife John and Linda Kutey won big money back in 2011.  Mr Kutey was one of seven employees at his firm who cashed in a $319 million winning ticket. His share was $28.7 million.  The pair decided to build a $200,000 waterpark in their community in honour of their parents.  Start a TV show  19-year-old Jonathan Vargas couldn\\'t believe it when he scooped $35.3 million in 2008.  Mr Vargas bought a TV production company with the money, launching Wrestilicious - a show featuring scantily clad women wrestling.  The show was not renewed for a second season and Mr Vargas is said to have spent the majority of his winnings.  Pursue dreams of becoming a photographer  Canadian teenager Charlie Lagarde won C$1m with her very first lottery ticket in 2018.  Rather than receive the money in a lump sum, she opted for weekly instalments of C$1,000 for life.  Ms Lagarde said she would use the money to travel and finance her dream of becoming a National Geographic photographer.

       " 'Pensions Legal ruling opens door to new pensions death tax risk The pensions of savers in ill-health face the threat of inheritance tax after HM Revenue & Customs won a controversial appeal case.  Pensions are generally assumed to be exempt from death duties - but in theory if someone transfers their pension and then dies within two years, inheritance tax can be applied.  Almost all transfers are granted an exemption, unless there are suspicions money was moved in order specifically to dodge tax.  That was what HMRC argued in a Court of Appeal case it won in June, the details of which have just been published.  The tax man argued the late Mrs Staveley transferred her pension six weeks before her death in 2006 in order to limit the tax her sons would have to pay on her estate. Prior to the appeal, a tribunal ruled Mrs Staveley\\'s sole reason for moving her pension was to make sure it did not end up in the hands of her ex-husband.  Yet the Court of Appeal eventually agreed with HMRC, which appealed against two previous judgments.  Tom Selby, of pension firm AJ Bell, said the ruling caused \"major confusion for pension savers in ill-health\" and risked landing families with a \"shock 40pc tax bill on the money left behind by a loved one\".  He said: \"What we are left with is a complex, nonsensical web of rules which risk layering on extra worry for beneficiaries at a time where they are likely to be suffering from serious emotional distress.  Inheritance tax | How does it work? \"Instead of allowing court rulings to determine whether inheritance tax is due on retirement funds left behind, the Government could radically simplify the system by exempting pensions from inheritance tax altogether.\"  Everyone has a £325,000 allowance before inheritance tax is due at 40pc. In addition, the \"family home\" allowance applies where a main residence is passed on to direct descendants. This is worth an additional £125,000 per person this tax year.  As married couples and civil partners inherit each other\\'s unused allowances, a couple can pass on £900,000 free of death duties. From April 2020 this will rise to £1m.  Pensions\\' tax treatment on death depends on the type of scheme. A \"final salary\" pension normally dies with the spouse of the scheme member, while \"defined contribution\" savings can be passed down indefinitely.  Unspent defined contribution money is taxed at the highest income tax rate of the person receiving it. In many cases, this means pensions are passed on entirely tax-free.  An HMRC spokesman said: \"The Court of Appeal unanimously upheld HMRC\\'s appeals against the decisions of the First Tier and Upper Tribunals.  \"HMRC believes that an individual transferring funds between pension schemes whilst in ill health, with a view to leaving the death benefits for others, will make a \"transfer of value\" which may give rise to inheritance tax.\"  sam.brodbeck@telegraph.co.uk',\n",

The small Mornington Peninsula suburb is the most searched among buyers in Victoria on realestate.com.au.  The property listings site\\'s report on the most in-demand suburbs also lists Red Hill fourth nationally, with the top 10 covered by four states.  The rankings are based on the number of views per property listed for sale on the website.  Related: Flinders a peninsula top performer  Former Coles family weekender aims for price record  Local agents say many people are keen to enter Red Hill, which had just 731 residents in the 2011 Census.  Homes there are tightly held, with owners holding on for long periods, with a median of 13.5 years.  Just 13 sales have been recorded since the start of this year, records show.  Two recent listings have come under offer, with another dozen listed for sale on realestate.com.au as at October 19.  The beautiful surrounds and semirural feel plus a growing cafe and food scene are among the factors behind the area\\'s rising popularity, according to agents.  \"Red Hill attracts a lot of aspirational buyers and we see more families coming here in addition to those retiring or looking for holiday homes,\" Kay & Burton Flinders agent Meg Pell said.  \"We find buyers are very particular about what they want and so take their time to find the right property.  \"Perhaps this is why the area ranks high with searches by buyers.\"  It also has a family friendly and safe image, which was attractive to buyers, Ms Pell said.  The area offers a \"country lifestyle and still reasonably priced homes compared to more pricey Shoreham and Flinders\", according to RT Edgar Mt Eliza director Vicki Sayers.  \"It has a great community feel and is also becoming cosmopolitan with more restaurants and cafes and markets,\" Ms Sayers said.  Red Hill had a median house price of $895,000 in the 12 months to July, CoreLogic data shows. The median price has risen 39 per cent over a three-year period.  While rising strongly, the median price is still well behind the nearby suburbs of Flinders, Sorrento, Fingal and Balnarring Beach where median house prices are above $1 million. Portsea had a $1.945 million median house price over the same period.  \"Red Hill is quite far from town but offers the ability to buy beautiful big homes,\" realestate.com.au chief economist Nerida Conisbee said.  \"Dollar per square metre you get a lot more for your money than when you move into the inner Melbourne suburbs.\"  Ms Conisbee added the peninsula was \"increasingly an area people are willing to commute from and there are a lot of beautiful homes there\".  \"It comes down to the big homes on the big blocks but also the premium nature of properties in the area,\" Ms Conisbee said.',\n",
       " 'Elon: DeJoy-Wos endowment to fund four full scholarships per year An endowment unveiled at the inauguration of Elon\\'s ninth president, Connie Ledoux Book, will provide full scholarships to Greensboro Title I school students whose families could otherwise never afford tuition at the university.  A Title I school is one that has a student base where at least 40 percent come from low-income families.  The DeJoy-Wos Odyssey Scholars Endowment will start out providing full rides for four students per year, and will grow in the coming years to provide 12 full scholarships per year.  The endowment is a joint venture between the Odyssey Program, the Martha and Spencer Love School of Business, Guilford County Schools and the United Way of Greater Greensboro.  The dollar-figure behind the endowment is not being released. In 2017, the average annual cost of tuition at Elon University was listed at $34,273.  \"This dedication of personal resources by the DeJoy-Wos family represents the hope and confidence in an Elon education and in the future of our local communities,\" Book said during her speech. \"Louis and Aldona are creating opportunity where little was imagined.\"  Book said students who receive these scholarships will gain access to an Elon education and experiences, preparing for lifetimes of service.

The Odyssey Program includes tuition assistance, a stipend for books and supplies and a one-time global grant for students to study abroad or Study USA program.  \"I am so pleased that we are able to provide otherwise unavailable educational opportunities for the youth of our community,\" said Wos. \"It is especially rewarding to me to enable educational growth on all levels and to encourage and support our future leaders.\"  Did you find this article useful?

       " \"Money Mail TAKE THE HASSLE OUT OF SWITCHING SAVERS can earn more interest and?\\xa0make switching accounts more straightforward by signing up to a slick new\\xa0service.  So-called savings platforms are gaining popularity with people fed up with rock-bottom rates from the big banks and the tedious process of changing providers.  Hargreaves Lansdown Active Savings has pulled in £100?million in just five weeks following its launch last month. It comes hot on the heels of Raisin UK, which has attracted 15,000 customers since arriving in the UK in May.  Others including Octopus, Insignis Cash Solutions and Flagstone are also popular.  You sign up to an online platform and get a?\\xa0choice of fixed-rate bonds at top interest rates from smaller banks and building societies. Your money is covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme -\\xa0up to £85,000 with each bank you choose.  The big plus is that there is no paperwork when you switch to a new bond or easy-access account within the platform. You fill in your details just once on first signing up.  You can spread your money across providers, see all your accounts in one place and move cash in and out of your current account.  The firm should also alert you when your fixed-rate deal is ending, so you remember to swap to another top account.  Experts say switching accounts the old-fashioned way has proved a big turn-off, due to time-consuming form-filling and digging around for the right documents each time.  Nearly half of savers (45 out of 100) in taxable easy-access accounts don't bother and instead stay in old, poor-paying accounts for five years or more, found City regulator the Financial Conduct Authority.  What platforms offer is down to which banks and building societies have signed up to it.  Hargreaves Lansdown, Raisin UK and Octopus, with which you must have at least £1,000 to invest, offer access to a limited number of providers and plan to add more. Hargreaves offers bonds from Charter Savings Bank, Close Brothers and ICICI Bank.  Last week, it had top-paying Metro Bank and Coventry BS bonds. It will add easy-access accounts and cash Isas next year.  Raisin UK has bonds from Gatehouse, ICICI and B&C banks, and pays a bonus to savers putting in more than £10,000 that adds 0.2?pc to your rate. It also plans to add easy-access accounts to its range.  Octopus has bonds with OakNorth, Aldermore, Metro and Cambridge & Counties banks. Insignis, which launched in September 2016 and which has attracted £225?million of savers' money, has a much wider range, from 20 different banks, with both fixed-rate bonds and easy-access accounts. But you need a minimum £50,000 to sign up.  Flagstone has 26 different banks, but there is a huge minimum entry of £250,000. This will fall to £50,000 next year.  sy.morris@dailymail.co.uk  © Daily Mail\",\n",
       " 'COSTS DRIVE ELECTRIC CAR INTEREST Rising fuel prices will be reflected in higher prices in shops, but some business owners are showing more interest in electric vehicles to reduce their expenditure.  Fuel makes up about 15 per cent of freight costs, so any increase in a highly competitive industry will have to be passed on, according to Ken Shirley, chief executive of the Road Transport Forum.  \"Some [firms] have automatic fuel adjustment clauses so they\\'ll introduce them quickly unless they want to go out of business,\" he said.  \"Virtually everything is transported by a truck, whether it\\'s supermarket goods, whiteware or exports. So rising fuel prices have to have an immediate effect.\"  A Countdown spokesperson said it was too early \"to provide any view as to whether there will be any price impact as a result of current fuel pricing\".  Foodstuffs spokeswoman Antoinette Laird said fuel was one component of supermarket pricing, along with wages, compliance costs, insurance and other business levies.  \"It\\'s inevitable that at some point increased costs from our suppliers will be passed on to consumers.  \"We are looking for efficiencies at every level of our business to try and keep these to a minimum. It\\'s difficult to say at this point what any level of price increase might look like and when, or if, it is applied,\" Laird said.  Meanwhile, one of New Zealand\\'s vehicle leasing and finance companies has seen an increase in inquiries from businesses looking to adopt electric vehicles (EVs) to their fleets.  Driveline chief executive Lance Manins said there had been an increase of about 26 per cent in requests for EVs through his company since April, potentially due to regional fuel taxes and fluctuating fuel costs.  Manins said he was getting up to 15 more inquiries a week, which was substantial for a leasing company.  \"Most of our clients seem to be small to medium enterprises - maybe they want to make a statement about their environmental responsibility, or demonstrate a point of difference.\"  He predicted the trend towards EVs would accelerate in 2019.  It would create some uncertainty for his company, which sold cars from the fleet into the secondary market.  If there were more of them it might devalue the prices of Driveline\\'s sales - although, conversely, the effect might be offset if they became cheaper to purchase from the manufacturers.  Leasing was attractive to many companies because of the high initial outlay to buy EVs. And there were tax advantages, he said.  There were now more than 10,000 EVs on the roads in New Zealand - up from 440 four years ago.  Recent Ministry of Transport findings revealed that a higher number of private individuals owned EVs, and most were owned by Aucklanders.  Charging networks were becoming available throughout most of the country and charging times would reduce below 15 minutes, he said.  Next year the Tesla Model 3 will be available, at a cost expected to be cheaper than an imported Nissan Leaf, Manins said.',\n",

The Press Association understands that if Luke Johnson, the group\\'s majority shareholder, or another rescuer does not step forward with emergency funds overnight, the firm will be forced to appoint administrators.  Mr Johnson, a serial entrepreneur, is the largest shareholder in Patisserie Holdings with a 37% stake.

Patisserie Valerie in fight for survival after winding up order petition  PwC, which is working with the firm on its financial position, is the most likely to carry out the insolvency, but several other corporate undertakers are also thought to be waiting in the wings.  Even if a buyer for the group does emerge, any purchase would likely be conducted via a pre-pack administration process, where a new owner is able to shed onerous liabilities.  Emergency fundraising talks overseen by advisers to Patisserie Holdings were ongoing on Thursday evening. Other options on the table include a loan or a rights issue.  As well as grappling with a potentially fraudulent multimillion-pound accounting black hole, Patisserie Holdings has been slapped with a winding up petition over £1.14 million in unpaid taxes to HMRC.  High street closures  The firm said on Thursday: \"The company, in conjunction with its professional advisers, has during the last 24 hours, undertaken further investigation into the financial status of the company.  \"The board has now reached the conclusion that there is a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business.  \"Without an immediate injection of capital, the directors are of the view that that is no scope for the business to continue trading in its current form.\"  The company\\'s directors and professional advisers are \"assessing all options available to the business to keep it trading\".  The company\\'s future was originally thrown into question on Wednesday, when shares were suspended following the discovery of the accounting irregularities.  Patisserie Holdings said it has been notified of \"significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities and therefore a potential material mis-statement of the company\\'s accounts\".

       " 'MILLIONAIRE WROTE WILL ON POSTCARD A Taranaki woman who lived a frugal lifestyle and amassed millions in the process jotted a will on the back of a postcard - and a court has declared it valid.  The end of Kathleen Steiner\\'s life was spent in hospice care where she died on January 31, aged 59.  According to a death notice she passed away in her sister\\'s arms after a \"very courageous battle\". Despite owning a car valued about $1000, at the time of Kathleen\\'s death her estate was worth approximately $2.8 million.  Her wealth comprised two North Taranaki properties, the car, chattels and bank accounts and cash investments totalling about $2.2m.  According to a court document, Kathleen lived by herself in the farmhouse where she, her three sisters and her brother grew up. She never married and did not have children.  \"She lived a frugal lifestyle and amassed considerable wealth in doing so,\" the court document stated.  But before she died, Kathleen did not formally prepare a will. Instead she wrote various notes expressing how she wished her estate to be doled out.  They varied in length and detail, with one being written on the back of a postcard and two other documents written on a law firm\\'s note paper.  They were all signed and dated, while notes in her diary resembling a will was not.  Following Kathleen\\'s death, an application was made to the High Court of New Zealand by her sister, Margaret Steiner- Joyce, to declare the documents a valid will.  Margaret provided two affidavits in support of her application and said she was unsurprised Kathleen had named her executor of the will as she worked as a legal executive.  Written in the informal wills, Kathleen requested Margaret \"sort out who got what of her money\".  Cash gifts to various people were detailed, and Margaret and another sister, Rosina, were named the beneficiaries of the remainder of the estate. It was stipulated a third sister got nothing.  The court document explained that Margaret encouraged Kathleen to make a will.  She also recorded a conversation between the two of them in which Margaret spoke to Kathleen about making a will, and Kathleen made various statements about gifts she wished to make.  The court\\'s report stated Kathleen told her sisters about her wills and where to find them, but no one touched the documents until after she had passed away.  Justice Thomas said she was satisfied the three signed and dated documents expressed Kathleen\\'s wishes.  \"I place quite some weight on the fact the three documents are all titled as her will, are signed and all bear the same date,\" she said. \"In my assessment, read together, they appear to express her testamentary intentions.\"  She ruled the documents valid, of which she ordered Margaret to be executor and trustee. It was also ordered that specific bequests be dealt with as per Kathleen\\'s instructions, and the residue be divided equally between Margaret and Rosina.',\n",
       " 'Money Refunds for 10,000 with mystery phone charges More than 10,000 consumers are in line for refunds from firms that misled them into accepting charges on their phone bills.  The Phone-paid Services Authority (PSA), a telecoms regulator, has handed out fines totalling £2m to three companies over the past week - opening the way for customers to apply for reimbursement.  In the biggest case, a fine of more than £1m was given to Xplosion, which tricked customers into signing up to weekly charges of £4.50 for quizzes, competitions and videos.  The company\\'s websites used a tactic known as \"click-jacking\". Victims unwittingly signed up to subscription services by clicking links on hard-to-spot pop-up adverts on websites including quiz site QUIZM8 and pornographic websites such as Xvidland. The PSA received 252 complaints. Xplosion was fined and banned from operating phone-paid services for five years.  One customer of QUIZM8 told the regulator: \"I have no idea how or why my number became associated. I saw no promotion for the service and did not sign up for it.\"  He said he had not been aware of charges until his bank rejected the payment of his phone bill. \"I incurred bank charges as a result,\" he added.  In another case a fine of £700,000 was handed to Tobaji, which operated a website that offered contact numbers for companies such as Asos and Vitality.  Users would be charged for the calls and the website failed to make clear when there were free, or low-cost, alternatives available. The company made £661,000 in the course of a year.  The third company, PowerTel, was fined £200,000 for misleading people into overpaying for short phone calls. It had placed voice messages on \"hundreds of thousands\" of outof-use phone numbers, giving the number for a directory service.  These numbers cost between £2 and £6.98 a minute. One caller told the PSA he realised his mistake immediately and hung up, but was charged £7.05 for a 22-second call.  Customers of all three companies can now claim refunds .  A spokesman for the PSA said: \"Enforcement is a vitally important part of what we do. Where there is evidence of serious malpractice we have the power to bar services and providers from the market, order refunds and issue substantial fines.  \"These fines reflect the seriousness of the breaches in question. In each case the PSA tribunal found that the service providers had broken the rules, resulting in consumer harm.\"  The PSA said consumers should be cautious about what they clicked on to avoid following links that could lead to a charge and to make sure they understood the full cost of a service before signing up.  It advised people to be wary of customer service numbers that began with 087 or 09. The legitimate number may not be the first to appear on search engines. Consumers should check their phone bill to identify any unexpected or unrecognised charges.',\n",

But the offer is only available for a limited time and as long stocks last, so you'll need to be quick.  Morrisons' offer includes Cadbury Heroes and Celebrations as well as Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums and Jelly Babies.  The chocolate tubs normally cost £2 and the fruity sweets £3 per tub, so customers who pick up one tub each of the four will save £5.  Customers who prefer the sweets before the chocolate and buy four tubs of those instead, will save a total of £7.  It is currently the cheapest deal around compared to other supermarkets.  Tesco is selling Cadbury Heroes for £1.50, down from £3, compared to Asda, which sells the chocolate tub for £2.50, down from £4.  Tesco is also offering Celebrations at the same price as Cadbury Heroes, while Iceland is selling two tubs of Celebrations for £4, or £3 for one.  Both Sainsbury's and Tesco are also selling Maynards Bassets Wine Gums and Jelly Babies at a £1 discount - customers can pick up the packs for £1.50 each at Tesco or £2 each at Sainsbury's.  These prices will come in handy if you're not keen to pick up a large amount of tubs.  But if you see this as the perfect opportunity to stock up in time for Christmas, keep in mind that Morrisons doesn't allow each customer to buy more than 20 promotional items.  You may also want to be careful about how much you eat, the packs which range from 185g-400g, contain between 329-493 calories per 100 g.  Perhaps understandably, the chocolate tubs have the most calories with 475 calories and 493 calories per 100g.  If you're unable to pop by a Morrisons store, you can order the tubs online but you have to do so by October 9.  Customers who like to buy chocolate at Christmas should watch out for festive packaging, some shops charge double just because of this.  Recently it was also revealed that Quality Street had ditched the Honeycomb Crunch flavour, after bringing back Toffee Deluxe.  Meanwhile, from mid-October Morrisons shopper will no longer be able to enjoy the lucrative option of buying gift cards in order to earn points - the supermarket chain has decided to cut the points earned by 80 per cent.We pay for your stories!

       " 'Fighting for What Is Right: Nonprofit Alliance of Consumer Advocates Turns Back Time, Helps Homeowner Reverse a Trustee Sale Sold at Auction to 3rd Party Highest Bidder (PRWeb) - Sixteen years after moving to in his home in 2002, Timothy Mayher of Redondo Beach California found himself in a dire situation. Like so many Americans he had fallen on hard times and became late on his payments and lost the commercial property tied to his home. Although he had a legitimate hardship and tried the work with his lender, the bank filed a notice of default almost immediately. His bank based out of Texas had closed out that branch and he found himself not able to communicate on the status of his mortgage with anyone who was really aware of his particular situation. Mr. Mayher had actually been convinced that the sale of his commercial property had covered the money he still owed.  Six years of fighting back and hoping for a fair and beneficial outcome, the road had finally come to an end. With the lien having accrued over the years to a whopping $372K, Mr. Mayher was now losing his Southern California dream home after having personally repaid his lender more than $700K. After receiving a Notice of Trustee sale in March of 2018, Timothy Mayhers house was put up for auction on April 19th 2018. With what he believed to be no more legal recourse the house was auctioned off to a highest 3rd party bidder on 6/17/2018.  Whereas most mortgage, real estate professionals and attorneys would opinion that it is impossible to reverse a Trustee sale in the case where the property is sold to the highest 3rd party bidder, Timothy Mayher was pointed to NACAlaw.org. Tim was immediately seduced by the faith-based and nonprofit approach of N.A.C.A.  Under their direction and with ZERO money out-of-pocket, Tim was able to meet and engage with the Consumer Defense Law Group seeking a Trustee Sale Reversal, possible damages in addition to his surplus overage that remained from the sale. Tim today credits the Nonprofit Alliance of Consumer Advocates for returning his home, on 9/21/2018 Tim received confirmation from the Lenders Foreclosure Trustee that they were requested by his lender to rescind the foreclosure sale of his home. The home is now scheduled to be reverted back into Tims name so that the Nonprofit Alliance of Consumer Advocates can proceed to restructure his Home loan into a sustainable monthly payment.

When politics and fiscal necessity collide, outcomes are difficult to predict. But the current system should be left well alone.  Pension contribution tax relief has long been regarded as low hanging fruit for the Treasury.  But despite having cut the annual allowance and the money purchase annual allowance, the Treasury still feels it is giving away a huge sum in pension tax relief, which is not helped by the ongoing success of auto-enrolment.  Spending on pension tax relief should serve to avoid a bigger bill down the line for state benefit provision for an ageing population.  There has been talk of moving to a flat rate system of tax relief that would see a redistribution of the tax incentive away from the wealthy to those with less.  This has generally been presented as cost neutral, which means it would not give the much-needed boost to the Treasury's coffers.  What is the alternative? Further limiting pension tax relief by adjusting the existing mechanisms is a more obvious choice. One could argue that the current annual allowance of £40,000 is more than generous enough for the mass market. Indeed, some would cut it in two.  But at £20,000 it will increasingly impact ordinary workers with long service, for example those in public sector schemes, in receipt of a reasonable pay rise.  It also does not cater for those non-regular savers who ramp up their pension savings in later years when they are more able to do so.  The amount of pension contribution tax relief available to higher rate tax payers is regarded as the juiciest fruit because a very large proportion of what the Treasury 'spends' on pension contribution tax relief goes to a small group of higher earners.  While the Treasury could look to reduce the income thresholds at which the tapered annual allowance begins to bite, will this deliver the savings the Treasury requires against a backdrop of imposing this complex mechanism on more people? Furthermore, if higher rate tax payers are squeezed, they may start seeking alternative tax reliefs that could reduce Treasury income in other areas. If the movers and shakers become disenfranchised from pensions, this could lead to stigma around having a pension plan as it could be seen as a sign you are not successful.  Pensions should be left alone for the time being, at least to let the current system settle down and auto-enrolment contributions ratchet up. Continued change merely exacerbates the problem, by encouraging people to make contributions now rather than later for fear of losing out.  Reforms in other big ticket areas, such as looking at inheritance tax or national insurance, are more likely to aid the Treasury.

       " 'Business Millennial money The glass ceiling, the gender pay gap, and women\\'s pensions - when it comes to money, differences between the genders matter.  Money is power and each of these issues has been in the spotlight as campaigners have fought to get women on to the same financial footing as men. Financial inequality remains a massive social challenge and momentum is building around a lesser known piece of the money puzzle - why women shy away from the stock market.  British women are diligent savers and have opened far more cash savings accounts than men, but they are less likely to have invested their money. About 40 per cent of women have company stocks and shares, compared with 62 per cent of men.  Keeping savings stashed in cash is a ruinous strategy for the long term, especially with banks paying such low interest rates. Inflation erodes the value of the humble pound and unless you can turn one pound into two, or five, through investment, a lump of cash sitting in the bank will diminish in value.  It matters especially for women because, basically, men die while we keep on going. Apologies for this gloomy statistic but, of the people living alone over the age of 65, about 70 per cent are female. They\\'re widowed, divorced or single and (this is even gloomier) the pay gap follows women into retirement. British women\\'s pensions tend to be 40 per cent lower than men\\'s. That\\'s among the widest differential in Europe. So if a man has £20,000 a year to live off, a woman might have £12,000. Think how differently those two people would live.  While the spotlight has been on the gender pay gap during our working lives, the gap in retirement income has widened over the past decade. Ensuring that millennial women don\\'t face poverty in old age will mean not just saving, but investing more.  So why don\\'t we? I think the baffling jargon, masculinity and elitism of the investment world is off-putting. I hear from well-educated women on good salaries who understand how the Sadly, the gender pay gap follows women into retirement stock market works, but don\\'t know where to start.  I\\'d argue that the industry hasn\\'t been that bothered about engaging women, there\\'s been an assumption that we are naturally too cautious.  The stereotype that we\\'re caregivers focused on household finance still lingers. The number one question I hear from millennials is \"how do I start investing?\" It\\'s confidence, not fear of placing a bet, that women lack.  Maike Currie of Fidelity International, an investment manager, says that when women do invest, we\\'re pretty good at it. Studies from Warwick Business School and the University of California Berkeley have found that female investors do better than men - all the more reason to give it a go. Look out in the coming weeks for my guide to help millennials to start investing.',\n",

       " 'Business Aussie Home Loans rebels over CBA spin-off plans - DATAROOM Commonwealth Bank\\'s planned $8 billion demerger has struck trouble with Aussie Home Loans protesting against being part of the portfolio of assets that the bank is spinning off.  The deal remains on track to go ahead next year, but the process is understood to have become more difficult than expected and there are now questions over which parts of the business will be included in the final deal. CBA, the largest lender and bank by market capitalisation in Australia, announced in June that it would demerge its wealth management and mortgage broking businesses.  The wealth group will consist of Colonial First State, Colonial First State Global Asset Management and Count Financial. The decision to include Aussie Home loans in the spun-off business was instantly criticised by analysts, who believed it was put together with an odd set of assets. It is understood that Aussie Home Loans is deeply unhappy and has railed against the move.  The process is understood to have been strongly driven by CBA chairman Catherine Livingstone, who has taken charge of trying to repair the bank\\'s reputational damage following the Austrac scandal and the royal commission.  The bank\\'s incoming deputy chief executive, David Cohen, has oversight of the demerger and had been touted as a potential chief executive of the spun-off business. However, sources say that is now unlikely. CFS Global Asset Management chief executive Mark Lazberger is understood to be keen on leading the new business and has flagged his interest. A second leading internal candidate was thought to have been Michael Venter, the bank\\'s current chief operating officer of its wealth management business, but that prospect is starting to be downplayed.  One option open to CBA is separating Aussie Home Loans and its 20 per cent stake in Mortgage Choice from the demerged entity and working on a sale of the two assets. The plan is being considered now by CBA and UBS, which devised the demerger plan and presented it to the bank\\'s board.  During reporting season, CBA published the financial details of the demerged group - known as NewCo - for the first time for investors, who will receive stock in the group. The wealth management and mortgage broking company had a pro-forma cash profit of about $568 million in the 2018 financial year, up 5 per cent on the same time last year.  The business had about 2850 jobs at the end of June, down from 3000 a year earlier. It is increasingly likely that a large number of those jobs will be cut as the final composition of the demerged company takes shape.The bank flagged that NewCo would have the \"opportunity to make investment decisions to drive growth\", which was interpreted as keeping the option open to offload some divisions. NewCo\\'s total operating income in 2018 was $2.046bn, up from $1.73bn, and the net tangible assets were valued at $883m.',\n",
       " 'Money YOU\\'VE BEAN HAD Cost of high street coffee rockets 20 per cent - despite beans falling to cheapest price in seven years High street coffee chains are profiting from customers as prices continue to rise  THE price of high street coffee has risen by 20 per cent despite the price of beans falling to their lowest price for seven years.  The coffee bean market has plummeted by 67 per cent since 2011, from £2.23 per pound to a low of 74p last month, according to research by the MoS.  The cost of a \\'tall\\' cappuccino from Starbucks has risen from £2.15 to £2.60 as revealed by The Mail on Sunday.  Most high street coffee shops have adopted the 20 per cent increase despite the drop in production costs, according to industry experts Allegra.  Caffe Nero have raised the cost of their regular cappuccino to £2.70 - a 40p rise since 2011, Pret a Manger is charging £2.45 compared to £2.19 seven years ago and a \\'primo\\' from Costa which used to cost £2.15 will now set you back £2.35.  The coffee giants have been accused of profiting at the expense of their customers and MPs have called for prices to drop.  Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: \"It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. It\\'s time the corporations passed on wholesale savings to consumers.\"  Caroline Flint from the Public Accounts Committee said: \"British consumers have a right to ask why they aren\\'t passing on the fall in price.\"  The UK high street coffee market is so profitable, it is now larger than Italy\\'s, Allegra claims.  There are 24,000 coffee outlets and the amount being spent grows 7.3 per cent year on year.  An extreme contrast between the price of coffee beans and the cost of a high street coffee has been revealed after Coca-Cola bought Costa for £3.9 billion and German company JAB Holdings purchased Pret a Manger for £1.5 billion.  Coffee chains have profited from a global oversupply of coffee beans, which has caused its value to plummet.  Coffee Holdings, who owns Caffe Nero reported a profit of £2.6 million last year.  Meanwhile, the coffee chain has been criticised for paying less tax than expected on UK profits, as has Starbucks.  A Starbucks spokesperson said: \"Many factors contribute to pricing decisions, including rents, labour, competition, distribution, commodities - and coffee.\"  A Costa spokesperson said: \"The price of a cup of coffee does not simply reflect the cost of the beans.\"  A spokeswoman for Pret a Manger said: \"Our coffee prices take into account the cost of our ingredients, as well as operational costs such as wages.\"We pay for your stories!

       " \"Pru scraps drawdown block after IFAs complain over product closure M&G Prudential has reversed its decision to stop clients moving into drawdown after IFAs complained about the closure of its Flexible Retirement Plan.  Last month Prudential announced it was closing the Flexible Retirement Plan to new adviser business from 17 September. A document seen by New Model Adviser® said advisers would not be able to set up a new drawdown policy with the product's existing funds. At the time a spokesman for Prudential said clients who wanted to move into drawdown 'can talk to their advisers and switch into the Prudential Retirement Account'.  Following the announcement New Model Adviser® understands Prudential received a number of complaints from advisers who were unhappy with the product closure.  One adviser, who did not wish to be named, told New Model Adviser® he was unhappy as one of his clients in the Flexible Retirement Plan was about to move into drawdown but would have to receive advice about which alternative drawdown policy to move to.  This advice would involve a suitability report which the client would have to pay for or else the adviser would have to absorb the cost themselves. This would be much more costly than a drawdown conversion, the adviser said.  New Model Adviser® understands a number of advisers complained to the provider about this issue and some even asked Prudential to cover the cost of the advice.  However, a spokesman for Prudential confirmed the provider has now reversed the decision to stop clients moving into drawdown within the Flexible Retirement Plan.  'The Flexible Retirement Plan will still close to new business and top-ups next month, however where an adviser has a client that has been looking into drawdown, they will still have the option to use the Flexible Retirement Plan drawdown if they feel it is the best option,' the spokesman said.  This decision to allow clients to move into drawdown within the product was communicated to advisers at the end of last week.  The cost of advice  Nathan Fryer, director of paraplanning firm Plan Works, said if Pru had gone through with the plans to stop clients moving into drawdown in the Flexible Retirement Plan then advisers would have to produce a suitability report in accordance with Cobs 9.4.1 of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) handbook.  If the firm was independent this would have to involve comparing the new drawdown plan with the whole of the market again to make sure an alternative Pru product is the most suitable, Fryer said.  He estimated that to do a personal pension switch for an existing client it costs on average £1,150 in time based on: adviser review of existing scheme and a plan of action (two hours); paraplanner report and research (six hours); meeting and documents signed (one-and-a half hours); process applications and implement (one hour).  'That is my estimate of a very broad pricing structure based on the paraplanner, admin and advice,' he said.\",\n",
       " 'News The price is right for a fight when it\\'s $900m Dementia claim in mogul estate case  REG Grundy\\'s estranged daughter claims the media mogul was suffering from Alzheimer\\'s disease when making arrangements to bequeath his massive fortune.  Kim Robin Grundy, now known as Viola La Valette, appeared in the NSW Supreme Court yesterday, seeking access to documents about her father\\'s mental capacity and the extent of his wealth before his death in 2016.  Ms La Valette is contesting his will and has been fighting his widow Joy Chambers-Grundy, who inherited his estate, believed by his daughter to be worth more than $900 million.  Her barrister Michael Meek SC said Mr Grundy, creator of TV game shows Wheel Of Fortune and The Price Is Right, owned a stack of offshore companies registered in Bermuda, Antigua, the British Virgin Islands and the United States.  He said the couple also owned Cantilever, a Bermuda-based entity listed in the Paradise Papers - the largest leak in history into the tax haven industry.  Mr Meek said the pioneering tycoon suffered \"Alzheimer\\'s disease and cognitive impairment\" before he died.  \"Six weeks prior to the deceased\\'s death there was a settlement in which the entire proceeds of that trust was given to (the wife),\" he said. \"It was set up to fund the provisions under the will. We were told that there were no assets anywhere in the world to fund the provisions under that will.\" Mr Meek said Ms La Valette, the daughter from his first marriage, and Mrs Chambers-Grundy, his second wife, attempted mediation in July but that\\'s now \"dead and buried\".  Chris Harris SC, for Mrs Chambers-Grundy, a former Logie Award-winning actor, confirmed on Monday that her late husband\\'s overseas assets are worth $800 million. He also claimed Mr Grundy\\'s NSW assets are worth an additional $71 million, but noted the daughter\\'s valuation is double that.  Mr Harris told the court it was possible Ms La Valette could seek to have the will declared invalid and substituted by a previous version that gives her \"significantly greater benefits\".

       " 'MIL-OSI USA: LaHood proposes pro-growth solution to tackling student loan debt Source: United States House of Representatives - Representative Darin LaHood (18th District of Illinois)  A newly introduced bipartisan proposal offered by U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood (R-IL) would put student loan payments on par with how foundations make scholarship payments under the U.S. tax code.  \"This bipartisan legislation will not only help recruit talent to often underserved areas and professions, relieve individuals of student loan debt, and help foster economic development to particular regions, but charitable organizations will be provided greater flexibility to serve their unique communities,\" said Rep. LaHood.  The Workforce Development Through Post-Graduation Scholarships Act of 2018, H.R. 6486, would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude certain post-graduation scholarship grants from gross income in the same manner as qualified scholarships to promote economic growth, according to the bill\\'s draft text.  \"With this amendment to the tax code, foundations and charitable organizations across the 18th District will be able to attract greater talent and reward professionals for committing to their local communities,\" the congressman added.  Post-graduation scholarships, according to the congressman\\'s office, are charitable grants that foundations would make to attract a skilled workforce that\\'s needed in a particular region. For example, a foundation that seeks to bring nurses or doctors to a community with a shortage of skilled medical professionals could award a post-graduation scholarship, but require that award winners live and work within a certain range of zip codes for a set number of years. In turn, the post-graduation scholarships would be used to pay off a portion of the award recipient\\'s student loans.  U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell (D-AL), the original cosponsor of H.R. 6486, pointed out that rural hospitals, in particular, often struggle to recruit medical professionals. Thus, programs such as what\\'s proposed under the bill \"are a critical pipeline of talent.\"  H.R. 6486 \"takes a smart approach to building a skilled workforce in underserved communities while at the same time tackling our nation\\'s student debt crisis,\" Rep. Sewell added.  Gene Cochrane, interim president and CEO of the Council on Foundations, said H.R. 6486 is long overdue because communities have been unable to retain skilled professionals \"to fill the most-needed jobs.\"  \"Philanthropic organizations have been wanting to help,\" said Cochrane. \"This legislation gives foundations a much-needed tool to assist loan-burdened graduates and communities who need their skills.\"  Josh Gibb, president and CEO of the Galesburg Community Foundation in Galesburg, Illinois, agreed and noted that in 2017, Illinois had the largest \\'out migration\\' of skilled professionals of any state in the nation.  \"Post-graduation scholarships are a win-win, because not only do the recipients benefit, but so do our communities, our employers and the people who call our communities home,\" Gibb said.  H.R. 6486 has been referred to the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee for consideration.  MIL OSI USA News -',\n",
       " \"Heard on the Street Markets Trump's Narrow Window for Trade Wins in China; U.S. leverage in its trade dispute with China may be close to its peak Corrections & Amplifications  Jean-Claude Juncker is president of the European Commission. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated he is president of the European Union. (Aug. 2, 2018)  Right now U.S. leverage over China on trade looks strong, but the advantage may not last long.  U.S. President Donald Trump is considering much higher tariffs on Chinese imports than previously outlined-25% on the next $200 billion tranche of goods, rather than 10%. This reflects confidence in the U.S. negotiating position following news that the local economy is growing briskly while China's is weakening. Mr. Trump also reached a detente with Europe in last week's meeting with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, isolating China.  This could be as good as it gets for the White House. Chinese policy makers are moving more aggressively than expected to stimulate borrowing and spending. Given the usual two to three quarter lag before that shows up in growth numbers, any breakthroughs that could favor U.S. companies-such as a more open environment for foreign investment and tighter protection of intellectual property-may skitter away if they aren't nailed down in the next nine months.  To see how quickly the policy picture is evolving in China, look at money-market rates. Weaning small banks off their dangerous dependence on short-term interbank borrowing was a key goal of China's recent push to deleverage the economy. From mid-2016 to mid-2017, overnight borrowing rates rose by nearly a percentage point.  Now those rates are dropping fast, as policy makers worry that expensive bank funding is crimping small business lending, which smaller banks dominate. Weighted average bond-backed one-day borrowing rates, which were averaging 2.5% in June, closed below 2% on Wednesday. One-day bond repo volumes have skyrocketed, notching a new monthly high in July following steep falls in late 2016 and early 2017 during the height of the deleveraging push.  Banks are also receiving informal guidance from the People's Bank of China to step up corporate lending. The central bank has reportedly eased capital-adequacy requirements for certain banks, which will make it easier to boost loan growth.  On the U.S. side, salad days of 4% growth and 2% inflation look hard to sustain. The Labor Department's quarterly survey showed that civilian workers got their biggest pay increase in close to a decade over the year through June. Consumer price inflation, already hovering around the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, may not be far behind. And the next tranche of threatened tariffs will hit industries that China dominates, meaning finding alternative suppliers to alleviate an upward squeeze on prices will be tougher. China supplies over 50% of U.S. imports across the affected sectors, according to Capital Economics.  President Trump's window for a favorable deal with China is a narrow one. Investors should look for breakthroughs by early 2019-or not at all.  Write to Nathaniel Taplin at nathaniel.taplin@wsj.com\",\n",

       " 'Raleigh comes in at no. 4 for cities with most student loan debt, according to study Duke University ; Durham, NC - news  By Kathryn Silberstein  As one of the three cornerstone cities of the Research Triangle, Raleigh draws a heavy population of young graduates in search of work-and with that, a large number of those who owe student loans.  Raleigh is fourth in line for the title of \"Places that Owe the Most in Student Loans,\" boasting 9 percent of residents who owe over $100,000 and a median balance owed of $21,357, according to a 2018 study conducted by LendingTree.  However, the study emphasized that with 44 percent of residents holding bachelor\\'s degrees or higher-compared to a national total of 30 percent-the number of residents facing student loans is not surprising.  Alison Rabil, assistant vice provost and director of undergraduate financial aid at Duke, emphasized the disproportionate number of students present in the area.  The volume of students itself might be a factor, she explained.  With a sticker-price tuition of $55,960 per year, a Duke University undergraduate education is a large investment, and one might expect Duke students\\' debt to elevate the regional average as a result. However, Rabil noted, the University is dedicated to ensuring that is not the case.  \"Our average debt runs about $20,000 per student, which is less than the average at [the University of North Carolina]. Just because our sticker price is higher doesn\\'t mean our average borrowing is higher,\" Rabil said.  The $20,000 figure comes in below Raleigh\\'s median balance and the national average debt of $37,172 per student loan borrower.  Rabil also explained that Duke\\'s label as an elite institution might be deceiving to students and parents considering what type of school could offer the most cost-effective education. She noted that Duke\\'s \"elite\" status translates to elite types of programs and opportunities available, not necessarily a prohibitively expensive education for most students.  Although LendingTree did not specify whether students\\' debt was attributable to undergraduate or post-graduate education, Rabil suggested that a larger proportion than most people might understand actually comes from graduate school.  \"In-state residents might borrow $150,000 to go to law school at UNC,\" Rabil said. \"Graduate programs don\\'t have aid or reduced tuition figures like undergraduate programs.\"  She noted that in the past, the amount of debt that graduate students would accumulate during medical, law, business or other graduate school programs was proportional to the salaries they could earn immediately after completing their educations. However, this is not necessarily the case in today\\'s economic environment.  \"Before 2008, graduated students could command jobs with huge salaries and pay off [their loans] in a few years, but those jobs are not out there in the same quantities anymore,\" Rabil said. \"It\\'s a financing model that was real 10 years ago so debt levels were not so scary.\"  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))',\n",
       " 'Third Circuit Upholds Foreclosure Sale Against Preference Attack On July 19, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals entered a decision upholding the results of a foreclosure sale against a debtor\\'s allegation that the sale was a preference because the bankruptcy estate could have sold the property for a higher price. Veltre v. Fifth Third Bank (In re Veltre), Case No. 17-2889 (3d Cir. July 19, 2018).  Veltre\\'s home was encumbered by two mortgages prior to her bankruptcy; a senior mortgage in favor of Capital One Bank and a second mortgage held by another bank. Veltre defaulted on her loan, at which point the first lienholder foreclosed and the property went to sheriff\\'s sale. At the sale, the second lienholder purchased the home at auction for $90,000, which paid off the first mortgage in full.  Veltre later filed for bankruptcy and sued to avoid the foreclosure sale as a preferential transfer to the second lienholder. Among other things, this required her to show that the second lienholder received more than it would have in a Chapter 7 liquidation. Veltre\\'s theory was that the foreclosure sale suppressed the price of the real estate, and that in Chapter 7, the home would have sold for a greater amount. Thus, the second lienholder received a better deal in the foreclosure sale than it would have in bankruptcy. Veltre did not allege that the foreclosure sale was collusive or that it failed to comply with state law.  The Bankruptcy Court dismissed Veltre\\'s suit, concluding as a matter of law that a properly conducted, non-collusive sheriff\\'s sale is not a preference. The District Court affirmed. So did the Third Circuit.  The Third Circuit recognized that \"the Bankruptcy Code is ambiguous as to a foreclosed property\\'s value.\" Slip Op. at p. 4. However, it applied a Pennsylvania state-law presumption that the price received at a properly conducted foreclosure sale is the highest and best price obtainable. Since the foreclosure sale was presumptively the best price that the estate could receive, the court could not conclude that a bankruptcy process would have returned more value to the estate as a matter of law.  This decision will help provide certainty for foreclosure sales, at least in states where duly performed foreclosures carry a similar presumption that they returned the highest and best value. However, it is also a reminder for both foreclosing entities and foreclosure sale buyers of the critical importance of ensuring that the foreclosure sale complied with applicable law, without which the second lienholder may have been required to litigate whether its foreclosure purchase returned an actual market value.

One of the biggest - and often costliest - retirement mistakes investors are making today  Many retirement investors are including target-date funds in their 401(k) plans, but this strategy may not be a smart move, according to this article on CNBC. Some experts believe that this approach will prevent them from accounting for their life expectancy, risk tolerance, income changes and other factors. \"Although they have substantial benefits, target-date funds ultimately provide too much of a cookie-cutter approach to asset allocation,\" says a financial planner.  6 portfolio to-do\\'s for retirees at midyear  The midyear is a great time for retirees to make financial moves in their portfolio, according to this article on Morningstar. For example, they may want to check their year-to-date withdrawal rate and account for the tax bite to determine if it is sustainable. Retirees should also consider an IRA conversion as it will trigger a lower tax bill under the new tax law and enable them to boost after-tax income in retirement. Having an action plan for required minimum distributions is also recommended, reinvesting the withdrawn amount they don\\'t need in a taxable account.  Bull or bear market - who cares? With the right portfolio, it shouldn\\'t matter  Investors need not worry about how market volatility will affect their portfolio if they have a strong investment plan in place, writes an expert on Kiplinger. This means that they diversify their portfolio by including other options, such as real estate, commodities and hedge funds. They should also determine their tolerance for risks and define their purpose for their investments, writes the expert. \"If your portfolio is designed and implemented specifically for you - and is consistent with your financial situation, your needs and your personality - you should be able to ride out the market\\'s ups and down without letting emotions get the better of you.\"  Social Security: What to know, what to expect, how to make it better  Although Social Security will stay, the program faces financial woes that can lead to reduced retirement benefits in the future, according to this article on MarketWatch.

       " 'ACCC takes power company to court for dodgy discount Power retailer Click Energy tried to confuse consumers into accepting \"discounts\" that would charge electricity at higher rates than its regular prices, the consumer watchdog has claimed in a case it says tackles the worst instances of energy bill deception it has seen.  The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission on Monday announced that it had begun proceedings against Click Energy\\'s parent company Amaysim, claiming it was directly in breach of consumer law and made false or misleading marketing claims about its electricity discounts.  Click claimed, between October 2017 and March 2018, that under its offer consumers in Victoria and Queensland could get discounts of between 7 and 29 per cent off their bill if they paid on time.  The ACCC said these figures were designed to bamboozle customers and were misleading as the discounts applied to Click\\'s market rate, which was higher than basic offers on the market.  ACCC chairman Rod Sims told Fairfax Media that while this was not the first time it has taken a retailer to court over poor discounting practices, \"this is more serious than most.\"  \"The advertised savings were based on the amount a consumer could save with Click Energy by paying on time, and not on any estimate of savings a consumer switching from another retailer would obtain,\" Mr Sims said.  \"We believe that Click Energy\\'s conduct is among the worst practices we see in retail electricity marketing.  \"We allege that consumers were misled about discounts and savings, with some consumers not getting any discount or savings at all.\"  Click also allegedly claimed customers could save a certain amount if they switched electricity retailers, which the ACCC said was wrong.  \"We allege is false or misleading as they had no proper basis for these representations,\" the ACCC said.  The penalty for each breach of the consumer law is around $1.1 million.  Mr Sims said it is disappointing discount practices such as these are still happening, despite heavy fines being levied against other retailers.  \"The retail electricity market is too complex and opaque. Customers need to trust that discounts and savings advertised by retailers are accurate so they can make informed choices about which products are best for them.\"  Earlier this year the Australian Energy Market Commission announced stronger rules designed to stop the practice of retailers offering what it called \"pseudo-discount deals that leave consumers worse off\".  These rules are designed specifically to counter retailers inflating the base rate from which they applied a discount, to make discounts appear bigger than they were, which is what Click is alleged to have done.  Federal Environment and Energy Minister Josh Frydenberg said retailers are being put on notice over poor discounting practices.  \"Big discounts on an energy offer can seem very attractive, but if the discount is only available because the price of energy is artificially inflated, the consumer can end up worse off,\" Mr Frydenberg said.  Click Energy has been approached for comment.',\n",

GETTY  TRAVEL HACKS: You don\\'t always need to show your boarding pass in airport shops  Many holidaymakers are enticed by airport deals and promotions.  While it is possible to get a tax free bargain, some stores charge travellers inflated prices.  Consumers must hand over their boarding passes in duty free - but there are instances where you can swerve doing so.  On a This Morning segment, Martin Lewis spoke about the common travel misconception.  The Money Saving Expert founder told the ITV show: \"You do need to show when buying anything in a Duty Free shop - even if it isn\\'t alcohol or tobacco.  \"You\\'re potentially being exempted from duty, so HMRC needs to know where you are flying to, regardless of what you\\'re buying. So if they ask don\\'t resist.\"  This information is also available on the HMRC website, which explains: \"Duty-free shops can sell goods where the excise, customs duty or VAT has been suspended, usually alcohol and tobacco.  \"Sales in duty-free shops are tightly controlled and HMRC requires these outlets to know where the passenger is travelling to before completing a sale.\"  Boeing 787 Dreamliner private jet pictures  But while holidaymakers are required to show their boarding details in duty free, this doesn\\'t mean you must in all airport shops.  Some stores that don\\'t offer VAT-free products may still ask to see your booking information.  This allows them to make more of a profit on your purchases - as they can claim back the tax.  In these instances, you are not required to hand over your passes.  Martin Lewis said: \"In other airport shops, you don\\'t need to show your boarding pass, even though they often push you to do so.  \"Many people are rude to duty free staff over this confusion. The reason for this is if you\\'re travelling outside of the EU they can claim the VAT back?  \"I was involved in campaigning for people not to show boarding passes in these shops, unless they split some of that gain.  \"Some now do - to an extent.

However, consulting an accountant or a tax professional is recommended, as the strategy could trigger a tax event, explains the expert. \"If the investor is still working and earns uneven income from one year to the next, they can potentially take advantage of the \\'lean\\' years to convert a higher balance to Roth since they may be in a lower tax bracket. Further, the investor can \\'spread\\' the tax burden across years by converting in stages rather than all at once.\"  Here\\'s how Social Security generated $1 trillion in income last year  Although a report from Social Security Board of Trustees shows that its asset reserves will be depleted by 2034, the program has other sources of revenue to pay its benefit obligations, according to this article on Motley Fool. In fact, the report shows that Social Security generated $996.6 billion in income last year, thanks to payroll taxes, taxes on the benefits and interest earnings from asset reserves.',\n",
       " 'News Most retirees\\' wealth is passed to children MOST wealth held by retired people is likely to be bequeathed to future generations rather than spent, research has found.  But younger generations may not actually see their inheritance until they are older themselves because people often pass their wealth to their surviving spouse before it filters down.  The study, which focused on England, found the bulk of retirees\\' wealth tends to stay intact - implying most of it will eventually be bequeathed to later generations.  In England, those approaching retirement aged 55 to 64 hold £185,000 in housing wealth and around £33,000 in other wealth excluding pensions, according to the research funded by the Institute For Fiscal Studies (IFS), Retirement Savings Consortium and the Economic and Social Research Council.  It found 80 per cent of over-50s are homeowners. It said based on current trends, the majority of home owners at age 50 would not be expected to move before they die. Meanwhile, around one in six of 55 to 64-year-olds own a second home. Researchers found the prevalence of second home ownership changes very little at age 70 and over, and increases slightly among those in their late 50s and 60s.  Financial wealth tends to be drawn down slowly, with the research suggesting that on average people will draw down just 31 per cent of net financial wealth between the ages of 70 and 90.  The research also looked at patterns of bequest giving.  It found that married people nearly always bequeath only to their spouse. And the surviving spouse most often bequeaths all of their assets to their children rather than sharing directly across multiple generations. This implies that inheritances will typically only be received at relatively older ages.  For example, someone currently aged 40 who was born to a 27-year-old mother and an older father might, on average, expect to receive a bequest from their parents at the age of 63. The research also said existing patterns might change in the future - for example if future retirees have lower pensions to live on than current pensioners, drawing larger sums from housing wealth may become more widespread.  Rowena Crawford, an associate director at IFS and author of a set of reports based on the research, said: \"Older people do not draw on their wealth much during retirement. The majority of home owners do not move or access their housing wealth, and even financial wealth is drawn down only slowly.  \"This means that most wealth held by retired people is likely to be bequeathed to future generations, rather than spent. \"This will have implications for the level and distribution of resources among current working age individuals, particularly those with wealthy parents and few siblings. Given the increased freedom people now have over how they spend their pension wealth in retirement, carefully monitoring how the use of wealth evolves in future will be important, both for the living standards of the retirees themselves, and also for younger generations.\"',\n",
       " \"News WEEKLY WRAP A round-up of the pensions industry stories published across the FT Group - from an investigation into the impact of IT blunders, to a demand for renminbi assets among institutional investors.  One in 10 open to cashing in whole pension FTAdviser: Around a tenth of the UK's adult population is open to cashing in their whole pension pot when they retire. Research from wealth manager Tilney found widespread uncertainty around the retirement people were looking for, with just 22 per cent saying they planned to stay invested, and 10 per cent planning to retire on an annuity. But 40 per cent said they had no idea what they would do with their pension when they retired, while 10 per cent said they would potentially use their pension freedoms to cash in the lot.  Highest earners face biggest growth in tax burden FT: Britain's highest earners paid 9 per cent more in income tax last year than the year before, according to analysis of HM Revenue & Customs data, a result of cuts to pension benefits introduced in 2016 by the then-chancellor George Osborne.Valuable tax breaks on pension savings were targeted by Osborne, who argued they were an inappropriate benefit for the UK's wealthiest.Those earning more than £150,000 paid £54.3bn in income tax in the 12 months to March, up from £50bn the previous year.  CALPERS joins push to bring more women into industry Fundfire: The California Public Employees' Retirement System, a group of asset managers and several Canadian public pensions are backing a CFA Institute initiative to boost the number of women in the investment industry. Allianz Global Investors, Natixis Investment Managers, Aviva and Generali, and a group of public pensions including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan have pledged resources and expertise to the CFA plan to eliminate gender inequality in developing markets.  Renminbi assets in demand among institutions Ignites Asia: Demand for renminbi assets among public pensions, sovereign wealth funds and central banks will eclipse US dollardenominated assets in the next two years, according to a study by thinktank the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.The survey, which sought the opinions of 120 public sector investors that have a combined $11.6tn (£8.7tn) in assets under management, found that 18 per cent of respondents expect to increase their renminbi assets in the next 12 to 24 years.

Former FCA board member Mick McAteer made the call as customers and advisers complained about ongoing disruption caused by botched IT upgrades. About 6,000 savings, retirement and investment customers with pension provider Aviva could not complete trades or did not receive income payments after glitches with a platform upgrade.\",\n",
       " 'MIDDLETOWN MAN SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS IMPRISONMENT IN EMBEZZLEMENT CASE WILMINGTON, Del., June 8 -- The U.S. Department of Justice\\'s U.S. Attorney\\'s office for District of Delaware issued the following press release:  David C. Weiss, United States Attorney for the District of Delaware, announced today that Donald Rice, formerly of Middletown, was sentenced on May 29, 2018, by Chief U. S. District Court Judge Leonard P. Stark to 48 months imprisonment.  The sentencing came after Mr. Rice pleaded guilty on October 26, 2017 to two counts of wire fraud and one count of making false statements on tax returns.  In December 2012, Mr. Rice became the trustee for a trust established to liquidate the assets of a closely-held investment company. As part of the trust plan, Mr. Rice was responsible for maintaining the funds set aside to cover the anticipated taxes associated with the dissolution of the company. Instead, between January 2013 and January 2015, Mr. Rice diverted approximately $3 million into his personal accounts through a series of wire transfers and the deposit of a cashier\\'s check. Mr. Rice then used this money for personal expenses, including the acquisition of several tax preparation franchises, a down payment on a new home, jewelry and a luxury vehicle. Federal law requires that all income, whether obtained legally or illegally be declared on tax returns. However, Mr. Rice failed to report the proceeds of his fraud on his tax return for 2013.  Mr. Rice also perpetrated a fraud against an elderly widow, and, after her death, her estate. While assisting this client with her \"estate planning\" in August 2011, Mr. Rice gained signature authority over her bank accounts and became executor of her estate. Following her death in March 2012, Mr. Rice wrote a series of checks to himself and his related business account, and liquidated a certificate of deposit for his personal use. In addition, Mr. Rice failed to notify a public pension system of his client\\'s death and continued to collect and spend her pension payments until October 2013, approximately 18 months after her death. Through these actions Mr. Rice stole additional funds totaling approximately $120,000.  U.S. Attorney Weiss stated, \"The defendant preyed upon people who placed their trust in him, victimizing companies and vulnerable senior citizens alike. His actions were unconscionable. Individuals like Mr. Rice who take advantage their positions and of vulnerable members of society should understand that their conduct will be uncovered and will be met with serious consequences. The sentence the Court imposed on Mr. Rice should send a clear signal to those thinking about abusing positions of trust and power.\"  The case was investigated by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation and the FBI. It was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Lesley Wolf. U.S. Attorney Weiss thanked the investigators for their excellent work in pursuing this investigation.

       " 'Lawsuit Seeks to Halt Rollout of California Secure Choice Savings The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association wants a federal district court to halt the program, based on ERISA preemption and the possibility that home-owning Californians could be called on to pay additional taxes to support Secure Choice, which aims at opening up retirement investing opportunities.  The Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association (HJTA) has filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California-on behalf of itself as a non-governmental employer and on behalf of its members as non-governmental employees, non-governmental employers, and California taxpayers-to halt the ongoing implementation of the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Trust Act.  According to its supporters, the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program is meant to provide a voluntary, low-risk, auto-enrollment retirement savings plan for many uncovered workers in the state who would otherwise have little opportunity to start saving in a constructive way. According to detractors, such as HJTA, the program will most likely prove to be an expensive experiment that does little to actually improve retirement savings adequacy in the state.\\xa0  Named as defendant is the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program and John Chiang in his official capacity as the chair of the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Investment Board. According to the text of the complaint, the act that created the Secure Choice program \"violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution because it is expressly preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\"  \"ERISA establishes nationally uniform standards to protect private employees and does not allow state-run retirement programs for private employees,\" the complaint states. \"Without preemption of CalSavers, such non-governmental employees\\' funds will have none of the ERISA protections intended for them by the federal government since 1974. CalSavers is thus ultra vires, and HJTA seeks a declaration that CalSavers is void.\"  HJTA further seeks injunctive relief under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 526a \"to enjoin the waste of taxpayer funds on implementation costs under way.\"  The filing of the compliant comes less than a year after the Trump administration and Congress cancelled an ERISA safe harbor established by the Obama administration, which was meant to prevent this very pre-emption issue. By issuing a new final rule,\\xa0\"Definition of Employee Pension Benefit Plan Under ERISA,\" the Department of Labor\\'s (DOL)\\'s Employee Benefit Security Administration (EBSA) removed\\xa0its final rules\\xa0regarding the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) safe harbor of government-run plans for private-sector workers from the Code of Federal Regulations.  Along some other lines of argument, HJTA suggests the fact that the U.S. Congress has expressly disavowed these types of savings arrangements established by States for non-governmental employees, means there is \"no potentially valid DOL regulation permitting this state-run retirement arrangement.\"  \"The nationally uniform application of ERISA requires that this Court declare CalSavers void,\" the group concludes.

       " 'News Wynne pledges \\'portable pensions\\' TORONTO - \"Portable pensions\" for workers to take with them from job to job would be created under a provincial Liberal government, leader Kathleen Wynne says.  The Liberals, if elected June 7, would also \"remove barriers\" so that outsiders could buy into existing pension plans - even if they have no connection to the company, she said.  Given the changing economy, \"we have to evolve the supports that people have as well,\" Wynne said at a campaign stop in downtown Toronto at Wattpad, an online publishing site where writers post their work to be critiqued by other users.  \"The parents and grandparents of the young people who work here may have gone into a company and worked in that company for 35, 40 years, and come out with a pension that is allowing them to have a dignified retirement.  \"That\\'s not the case for the young people who are working\" today, she said. \"The changing economy puts that decent retirement into jeopardy ... The reward for a lifetime of hard work shouldn\\'t be the prospect of spending your golden years struggling to make ends meet.\"  She noted the Ontario government had pushed the federal government for enhancements to the Canada Pension Plan, but \"there are still gaps.\"  \"We are going to take the next steps, so that, no matter where you work, you will be able to look forward to a more secure retirement. That is the objective.\"  The Liberals, she added, would \"support the creation of portable pension plans, that stay with one worker from one job to the next,\" allow others to join \"successful plans\" and also strengthen the power of the pension regulator to \"intervene where pensioners are treated unfairly.  \"When a company is in trouble, we are going to strengthen the ability of the regulator to intervene and make sure (pensioners\\') interests are taken care of,\" giving them \"greater priority\" if the company goes bankrupt.  The pledge is a response to the plight of Sears retirees, who saw their benefits decrease after the company went under. Earlier this year, the Liberals promised to give them up to $500 extra a month.  She said the Progressive Conservatives have not talked about pensions at all, and the NDP would not be willing to work with the private sector.  Wynne said more details on private-sector pensions will be released in the Liberals\\' formal platform, which will be out in the next few days.  About a third of working Ontarians are enrolled in a pension plan, but, among younger workers ages 25 to 34, it\\'s only about one-quarter.  Wynne said the Liberals will also increase the power of pension regulating authorities to intervene when Ontarians believe they are not receiving the pension benefits they were promised.  The premier pledged to grant access to private-sector pension plans to workers, such as contractors or part-timers, who may not qualify for them.  Ontario Liberal Leader Kathleen Wynne talks to employees during a campaign stop in Toronto, on Thursday.',\n",
       " 'Business Blackstone warns on threat to tax break Financials US states consider ending concession worth billions of dollars to hedge funds  Private equity group Blackstone has warned investors that it faces a growing risk of significantly higher tax bills because of efforts by US states to end a lucrative tax break that Washington lobbyists have fought hard to preserve.  A California proposal to levy state tax on carried interest - the share of investment profits that hedge fund and private equity managers are paid as an incentive to hit higher returns - faces its second key legislative hurdle this week.  Under federal law, carried interest is taxed as a capital gain, rather than as personal income, enabling hedge fund and private equity executives to pay lower tax rates on some of their earnings than salaried workers. California would eliminate that tax break by levying extra state tax to make up the difference.  The carried interest tax break, worth billions of dollars, has become emblematic of a tax system that campaigners criticise for favouring the rich while many ordinary Americans struggle with rising costs and stagnant incomes. Last year\\'s sweeping federal tax reform bill did not change the status quo - something that was seen as a victory for industry lobbyists.  Lawmakers in New York - the only state with more hedge fund managers than California - have introduced legislation to curb the tax break, which could raise nearly $1.1bn annually for the state, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo.  To avoid an exodus of fund managers, the proposed New York tax increases would be delayed until similar proposals pass in Connecticut, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. All told, at least 10 jurisdictions are considering such a move, according to the Hedge Clippers, a group campaigning to end favourable tax treatment of carried interest.  \"To some of these states, a few billion dollars is a lot of money,\" said Morris Pearl, chair of the Patriotic Millionaires, which is working with the Hedge Clippers in campaigning in favour of the legislation. \"Whereas at the federal level, it doesn\\'t really move the needle ... it\\'s just an issue of fairness.\"  Blackstone has long told investors that its tax rate \"could increase significantly\" if it abandoned the partnership structure that allows it to pay less tax on carried interest.  In a regulatory filing this month, it added new language flagging the draft California law and stating that several states were giving \"heightened consideration\" to a carried interest levy.  Blackstone cited the federal tax cuts signed into law last year by President Donald Trump as the impetus for the state initiatives.  The new federal law cut the tax bills of many wealthy Americans while failing to change the treatment of carried interest, despite its being a loophole Mr Trump criticised for allowing hedge fund and private equity managers to \"make a fortune\" and \"pay no tax\", which he called \"ridiculous\".  \\'At the federal level, it doesn\\'t really move the needle ... it\\'s just an issue of fairness\\'',\n",
       " 'BOOZMAN\\'S WATER INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT LEGISLATION INCLUDED IN COMMITTEE-PASSED WATER INFRASTRUCTURE BILL WASHINGTON, May 22 -- Sen. John Boozman issued the following press release:  The Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee approved the inclusion of legislation introduced by U.S. Senator John Boozman (R-AR) that will modernize investment in water infrastructure in its comprehensive water infrastructure bill.  America\\'s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, which was unanimously reported out of committee on Tuesday, includes Boozman\\'s Securing Required Funding for Water Infrastructure Now (SRF WIN) Act as a provision in the bill.  \"The SRF WIN Act is an innovative solution to updating our water and wastewater infrastructure in a way that communities of all sizes can afford. I\\'m pleased that Chairman Barrasso and Ranking member Carper recognize that fixing our crumbling infrastructure is a national priority. By including this legislation in the committee\\'s comprehensive water infrastructure bill, state and local governments will be able to more effectively meet underserved or unmet infrastructure needs,\" Boozman said.  Boozman\\'s work was praised by both EPW Chairman Sen. John Barrasso (R-WY) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. \"Thanks to Senator Boozman, [America\\'s Water Infrastructure Act of 2018] enhances the effectiveness of federal investments in our nation\\'s failing drinking water and wastewater infrastructure,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor.  The provision in the committee-passed legislation would:  * Authorize $100 million annually over two years to support state revolving fund projects exclusively. * Encourage states to bundle their projects by waiving the $100,000 application fee and streamlining the application process to a maximum 180-day turnaround.  * Promote transparency by requiring EPA to post the list of project applications received and those selected to receive funds.  * Help communities, both big and small, receive funding for their vetted drinking water and wastewater projects. * Preserve the successful state revolving funds (SRFs) and the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) loan program.  Earlier this month, EPW Committee leaders received a letter from the nation\\'s leading construction, engineering, municipal, conservation, public works, infrastructure finance, labor and manufacturing organizations urging members to include the SRF WIN Act as a provision in the committee\\'s Water Resources Development Act legislation.  The SRF WIN Act was introduced in February by Boozman and Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Jim Inhofe (R-OK) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA). Cosponsors include Senators Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), John Barrasso (R-WY), Bob Casey (D-PA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Roger Wicker (R-MS).  The legislation empowers states to invest in multiple water infrastructure projects. The bill combines the best aspects of state revolving funds (SRFs) with the leveraging power of the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) to make the process easier and more affordable for states to meet their underserved or unmet water infrastructure needs.

       " 'News $100 water bill hike A TYPICAL Logan family is expected to pay up to $100 a year more for household water in two years.  The proposed increase was outlined in the Queensland Competition Authority\\'s latest review of the state government bulk water price, released with little fanfare during last month\\'s Commonwealth Games.  The Final Report: Seqwater Bulk Water Price Review 2018-21 sets out two price plans for 11 councils over the three years from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2021.  Both options result in all 11 councils coming to parity and paying the same price to buy state bulk water by 2021. The report proposes lifting the current bulk water charge for Logan from $2.81 per kilolitre to $3.112 per kilolitre in 2020-21, equating to a 10.8 per cent increase.  That equates to a $48.80 hike in the annual water bill for the \"average\" southeast Queensland household of 2.53 people using 160kL a year. However, for an average Logan household of five people, the bill would be closer to an extra $96.44 per year. A family of four was likely to be hit with an extra $77.17 by 2021.  On top of that increase, Logan City Council, as the city\\'s water retailer, adds its own mark-up and charges for consumption using a volumetric billing system for each kilolitre of water used.  QCA chairman Professor Roy Green said bulk water charges accounted for about 30 per cent of an average household\\'s water and sewerage bill.  He said under the first option, the current bulk water price for Logan and seven other southeast Queensland councils paying the common price of $2.82 per kilolitre would rise by 5.2 per cent in 2018-19 and 2.5 per cent in each of the next two years equating to a rise of $23.20 in 2018-19 and $12 in each of the next two years.  Under the second option, he said the water price for Logan would rise by 3.5 per cent in each of the three years, resulting in increases for the average household of $16 to $17 each year.  Water law researcher from Bond University assistant Professor of Law Victoria Baumfield, pictured, said the planned price rises for the next three years were not just for price parity and were mainly to cut Seqwater\\'s $9.4 billion debt.  \"This debt dates back to when the Beattie/Bligh government took over water management from southeast Queensland\\'s local councils,\" she said.  \"In fact, until this year, the total debt owed to the Queensland Treasury Corporation was actually growing despite Seqwater hiking up the state bulk water charge almost every year.\".She said the cost of the debt was reflected in the fact that Logan ratepayers already pay one of the highest water usage rates in Australia and southeast Queensland residents paid more for water than any other state capital.',\n",
       " 'Investments How savers are using the Lifetime Isa Seven out of 10 One Family Lifetime Isa customers are saving for the long-term and many of them are planning on using it to fund their retirement.

Additional ways to save towards later life are likely to increase in popularity with 40 per cent of those aged less than 40 saying they do not believe a pension alone will be enough.  The research found the average monthly payment into a Lifetime Isa, which is being used for retirement, is £75.  If a saver takes a Lifetime Isa at age 30 and continues to invest every month, by the time they reach 60, with the government bonus and 5 per cent annual interest, they will have nearly £50,000 saved, having originally invested £18,000.  Nici Audhlam-Gardiner, managing director of Lifetime Isas at One Family, said: \"It is positive to see so many younger people are already thinking what they will need to fund their retirement.  \"It is important to start saving little and often as early as possible. The increase in people thinking about, and saving towards their retirement can in part can be put down to the government\\'s auto-enrolment scheme that sees all employees automatically being put into a company pension.  \"But this is only applicable to certain workers and excludes the self-employed and those in the gig economy. The number of private pensions is still very limited with just 11 per cent of under 40s having one.  \"Savvy savers thinking about retirement should consider the Lifetime Isa as another way to save and access the unique 25 per cent government bonus, and potential investment returns. The bonus is paid monthly so savers should make the most of the new tax year to maximise returns.\"  One Family research also revealed that 18 to 40-year-olds hope to retire at age 64.  This is three years prior to the current retirement age, meaning they would be without a state pension when they first stop working.  Savings from a Lifetime Isa can be withdrawn from the age of 60 and can therefore help bridge the gap.  Gemma Siddle, chartered financial planner at Eldon Financial Planning, said: \"Lifetime Isas are one of the only \\'standard\\' products that offer both tax relief and also accessibility should it be required.  \"Many people in their 20s and 30s feel home ownership is a dream and are not confident it is realisable; the Lifetime Isa gives them a good chance to save for this dream with the knowledge that capital can be used for retirement should the home-ownership dream not be realised.  \"In addition, they have the very important flexibility of access , albeit with penalty, should life take an unexpected turn.\"  aamina.zafar@ft.com',\n",
       " 'American Financial Benefits Center on Adulting and Student Loan Responsibility EMERYVILLE, Calif., April 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Being an adult comes with a lot of different responsibilities, and while millennials may poke fun at \"adulting,\" everyone experiences it differently. For some, getting their first \"real job\" or apartment might be the first signal that adulthood has officially arrived. For others, financial responsibilities may propel them into adulthood, and one financial issue may feature prominently in young adult minds: student loans. American Financial Benefits Center (AFBC), a document preparation company that helps its clients with federal income-driven repayment plan application and recertification paperwork, reminds borrowers that if their student loan responsibilities become too much, federal repayment plans may provide relief.  \"Adulting has a different meaning for each person, and can even change throughout a single day,\" said Sara Molina, Manager at AFBC. \"Student loan borrowers may share the experience of feeling like an adult when they have to deal with their loans.\"  Because finances are important for adult life -- adults must be able to pay for housing, food, and debts reliably -- managing them is an essential skill for adults to have. Therefore, financial bloggers write en masse about how to manage money, budget, save, and pay down debts. While individuals may decide to speak with a financial expert about their own situation, individuals can glean some basics from such blogs.  Financial adulting requires several characteristics that contribute to financial health: saving, paying down debts, spending thoughtfully, and knowing when to ask for help. Many young adults with student debt may find achieving financial health difficult. However, asking for help may lead them to federal income-driven repayment plans, in which payments are based on income and family size and can be reduced to as low as zero for certain circumstances.  \"Feeling like an adult is a double-edged sword,\" said Molina. \"Learning how to manage such heavy financial responsibilities is essential for adulting and can make financial life a lot easier. At AFBC, we help our clients utilize federal repayment programs that can ease their financial burdens. If they can feel young without ignoring their student loan responsibilities, we know we\\'ve done our jobs.\"  About American Financial Benefits Center  American Financial Benefits Center is a document preparation company that helps clients apply for federal student loan repayment plans that fit their personal financial and student loan situation. Through its strict customer service guidelines, the company strives for the highest levels of honesty and integrity.

       " 'Heir hunters\\' surprise visit An extensive search to find heirs to an unmarried man\\'s pension pot has resulted in a £30,000 windfall for a Sandwich woman.  Jacqueline Riordan, who featured in a new series of TV\\'s Heir Hunters this week, was contacted by professional probate genealogists Finders International.  They were looking for the next of kin to Deal postal worker Christopher Cole, from Thanet, who died aged 52.  The Royal Mail manager who worked at the delivery office in Stanhope Road had left a will but solicitors also discovered a £60,000 pension pot that surprisingly, due to a clause on the pension contact, could only be inherited by his next of kin and not by any beneficiaries in his will.  Mr Cole had followed in his father\\'s and grandfather\\'s footsteps by working for Royal Mail. He had spent his whole working life with the service and is remembered by his colleagues as somebody who \"lived to work\".  He had no children and no siblings, so Finders International went back a generation in the hope of finding next of kin.  The research on the maternal side of Mr Cole\\'s family didn\\'t bear any fruit and the only next of kin were found on his father\\'s side of the family. An uncle, Derek Cole, had two children, Jacqueline and Susan. These were Christopher\\'s first cousins and the ultimate heirs to the pension.  Ms Riordan, who received a knock on the door before agreeing to feature on the television programme, said: \"Unfortunately I hadn\\'t seen Chris since we were children. I\\'m really sad to have something from Christopher in that it means he\\'s passed but obviously I\\'m quite surprised and excited that he left something for me and my sister.\"  But it\\'s not just about the money for Ms Riordan who is also very interested in her family tree.  She said: \"I\\'m really excited about finding out more about the family tree. I have been looking at the family tree for three years now so when Finders International contacted me it was a shock at first, and now with the help of Finders, I can add more information to my own research.\"  Danny Curran from Finders International said: \"It is great that the pension money has been united with the rightful heirs.\"  It would have otherwise become government money.  He added: \"Nevertheless the case of Christopher Cole is a good example of why people should not only write a will but also have a forward view of all their financial assets, particularly pensions. \"Usually if a person has a property this will go through their estate. However, some financial products may fall outside this like in this case - where the clause in the pension meant that it would not form part of the estate but go to the deceased\\'s next of kin.\"  The story will be broadcast today (Wednesday) at 11am and is available on BBC iPlayer.',\n",

       " 'News People do not save enough for retirement because they live longer than they expect News  People live longer than they think they will, potentially harming their ability to save adequately for their retirement, new research has found.  It is increasingly important to plan for the future because recently introduced pension freedoms have given people more control over their retirement funds, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.  People in their 50s and 60s underestimate their chances of survival to age 75 by around 20 percentage points, and to 85 by around five to 10 percentage points, the study found. For example, men born in the 1940s who were interviewed at age 65 reported a 65 per cent chance of making it to age 75, whereas the official estimate was 83 per cent. For women, the equivalent figures were 65 per cent and 89 per cent.  However, as people get older they become increasingly optimistic about their chances of living longer. Individuals in their late 70s and 80s overestimate their chances of surviving to ages 90, 95 and above, on average. Over-optimism rises to 10-15 percentage points by age 80, and is more prevalent for men than for women, the IFS found. Men born in the 1930s who were interviewed at age 80 reported a 32 per cent chance of reaching the age of 95, but the official estimate is 17 per cent.  Widows and widowers are significantly more pessimistic about their survival chances than others at age 60, with 49 per cent and 39 per cent respectively believing that they will reach 80 years old. The official estimates are 77 per cent and 67 per cent.  The IFS compared Office for National Statistics data with the results of surveys of people at a range of ages.  The think tank said survival pessimism may make individuals reluctant to buy annuities. An annuity priced according to average survival chances should represent a fair deal (or better) for around half of individuals. But because people think that they will live shorter lives than they are statistically likely to, around two-thirds of individuals in their 60s would think an annuity priced according to average survival chances is a poor deal.  David Sturrock, a research economist at IFS and an author of the report, said: \"As individuals are given more responsibility for saving for their retirement, and more freedom over how they use those savings in their later years, it is a particular concern that many are systematically misjudging their longevity. When people underestimate their chances of surviving through their 50s, 60s and 70s, they may save less during working life, and spend more in the earlier years of retirement, than is appropriate given their actual survival chances. In contrast, people who overestimate their survival chances at the oldest ages may show an undue reluctance to spend their remaining wealth near the end of life. By misjudging their longevity, individuals risk having a lower standard of living in retirement than would otherwise be possible.\"',\n",

Here\\'s how long it took the richest people in the world to go from millionaires to billionaires.  It took Warren Buffett 26 years. Bill Gates? Only five.  But the record for fastest route from millionaire to billionaire currently goes to Facebook (FB, US) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who took just one year to make the leap, according to a study by Betway based on Forbes\\' annual \"World\\'s Billionaires\" ranking.  Zuckerberg\\'s path was lighting fast compared to the Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, US)\\xa0 CEO and investing guru, or to Koch Industries owner Charles Koch, who took 22 years to get there.  Here\\'s a list of the 25 richest people in the world in 2018, according to Forbes, followed by the number of years it took them to go from millionaire to billionaire, as compiled by Betway:  Zuckerberg was the youngest self-made billionaire to ever appear on the Forbes Billionaires list when he debuted in 2008 at the age of 23. He didn\\'t make the 2009 list, with his estimated net worth dropping below $1 billion, but it didn\\'t take long before Facebook\\'s valuation started to go way up, and Zuckerberg\\'s net worth along with it.  The analysis shows that founding a major tech company has been one of the fastest routes to billionaire-dom. Amazon (AMZN, US)\\xa0founder Jeff Bezos took two years to leap from millionaire to billionaire, while both Microsoft (MSFT, US)\\xa0founder Bill Gates and Google (GOOG, US)\\xa0(GOOGL, US)\\xa0co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin took five years to get there.  Related read:Warren Buffett explains what\\'s wrong with the economic system that made him billions  Related read: The No. 1 financial fear among rich people should have you seriously concerned  Almost a quarter of the billionaires analyzed by Betway had a degree in engineering, and about 20% had a degree in economics or business. About a third didn\\'t have a college degree at all.  There are now more than 2,000 people in the world who are worth at least $1 billion, a figure that has doubled in the past decade. Among those 2,000 people, the average age they joined the billionaire\\'s club was 51. Jeff Bezos was 35 when he became a billionaire, while Bill Gates was 31.  Of course, being a billionaire isn\\'t always what it\\'s cracked up to be. People aren\\'t exactly thrilled with Zuckerberg right now in light of the news surrounding Facebook\\'s data scandal.

       " 'Asia news \\'City\\' gender pay gap remains BARCLAYS CHIEF POSITIVE DESPITE BANK DATA RESULTS  MEN employed in London\\'s \\'City\\' financial district earn significantly more per hour than women excluding bonuses, according to the latest results drawn from UK-based banks\\' data.  Prime minister Theresa May\\'s Conservative government demanded that individual financial institutions reveal wage differentials between men and women across all employees - from back-office staff to highly-paid traders and board members.  And the results are unflattering for an industry that has long been marked by male-filled boardrooms and trading floors.  Among retail banks, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group - both rescued with vast amounts of taxpayers\\' cash during the global financial crisis - have pay gaps of 37.2 per cent and 33 per cent, respectively.  Among institutions that are more focused on investment banking, the difference is even wider.  Barclays has a gap of 48 per cent at its London-based investment bank unit. The equivalent is 55.5 per cent at US giant Goldman Sachs. The gap at HSBC\\'s entire UK operations, including investment and retail, is 59 per cent.  Karen Frank, chief executive of private banking at Barclays, said her company was slowly closing the gap but needed to attract more women into top positions.  \"From time to time, one can get a bit discouraged by the lack of progress in diversity across all industries,\" said Frank, who has spent more than 25 years working in financial services.  \"The good part about what we are seeing at Barclays is that we have actually made definitive progress.  \"In line with other sectors, the finance industry doesn\\'t yet have enough women at the top and the top of organisations is where the highest paid salaries are. For now at least, the majority of these roles are occupied by men,\" she added.  Frank insisted that Barclays was on a mission to \"encourage the next generation of women and the generation after that to come up through the ranks and occupy more senior positions\\'!  Barclays has noted that the gender gap is driven by two factors: the higher proportion of men in senior jobs and the higher proportion of women in more junior positions.  Conservative MP Nicky Morgan, chair of parliament\\'s influential Treasury Committee, said recently of the massive gender pay gap at Barclays\\' investment banking unit: \"For this to be the case in 2018 is shocking,\" although she acknowledged that the bank had committed to supporting the progression of female employees into senior jobs.  At the same time, Frank insists that women must perform harder and better than men to achieve that goal. \"We have to have the confidence to speak our mind, take risks and set our bar high,\" she said.  Frank further said in an interview: \"My personal philosophy, and that of Barclays, is that we are a meritocracy.  \"We want to see and encourage diversity, but we will always hire the best person for a role and for our clients.\" (AFP)',\n",
       " 'News STUDENT LOANS By ALICE CACHIA SOARING student debts coupled with crippling interest rates mean most graduates need to earn a salary of around £51,000 before they begin to pay off their loans, our analysis reveals.  Tuition fees now cost up to £9,245 per year - not including maintenance loans and interest charged while studying - and the costs continue to rise after graduation.  That is because the government charges interest on student loans.  In April repayment increase It means money graduates may think is repaying student loans is probably not doing so at all, and is more likely paying off interest instead.  Once graduates start working, they don\\'t have to pay anything until they earn more than £21,000, at which point nine per cent of their salary over this amount is automatically deducted from their paychecks.  However, graduate salaries also affect the interest paid.  Currently, those earning £21,000 are charged the minimum 3.1 per cent interest, while those earning £41,000 and above are charged the maximum 6.1 per cent interest.  this year the threshold will to £25,000 Those earning between the two figures are charged a proportionate amount of interest.  However, despite these increasing rates of interest for higher earners, the figures show that those earning the least are the hardest hit by the current system.  Imagine a graduate leaves university with student debts of £50,000.  If they had a salary of £25,000, they\\'d repay £360 of their student debt in the year, bringing the amount owed down to £49,640.  But £1,850 would be added onto that figure in interest - meaning the value of their student debts has actually INCREASED to £51,490.  In fact, graduates would have to earn a salary of £55,000 before even beginning to make a dent in their original £50,000 worth of student debt at the current rate of inflation.  Jake Butler, financial expert for Save the Student, said: \"The issue is more of a psychological one instead of a financial one for the majority of graduates.  \"This is because due to the loan being wiped after 30 years, most graduates will never earn enough to repay the total amount owed, let alone start paying off the interest.\"  It is a sentiment echoed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which predicts that students are graduating with so much debt that The amount of paid will change year depending inflation around 75 per cent are likely to never repay the full amount.  It also means most people will still be paying student debt while entering their 50s.

The budget retailer has become the first supermarket chain in the country to offer riding lessons, after teaming up with two prestigious riding schools to offer sessions.  The lessons, which can be bought online, will be available at the Summerhouse Equestrian in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, and Parbold Equestrian near Wigan, Lancashire, with prices starting from £21.  The supermarket has also unveiled its new equestrian range - meaning you can now get riding tops, jodhpurs, boots and special socks from your local store.  Those who buy their riding lessons from Aldi will save 30 per cent off the regular price.  In the lessons, riders will be taught a range of skills, including learning to mount and dismount a horse, developing their balance and control and how to stop and steer.  As well as offering horse riding lessons, Aldi has launched a new equestrian range for budding riders.  The range includes riding tops, jodhpurs, boots and special socks, with prices ranging from £2.99 to £19.99.  The equestrian gear is available at around half the price of products sold by popular equestrian brand Harry Hall.  For example, Aldi's PVC riding boots are available for £19.99, while a pair of similar looking boots at Harry Hall cost £39.99.  Professional equestrian coach Nicola Bennett, who has been teaching riding lessons for 40 years, said Aldi's discounted lessons are a great way to encourage new riders.  She said: 'We have seen an increased interest in our lessons over the years, but historically, it has been seen by many as an expensive hobby.  'We know that riding is now losing the 'elitist' tag, is more affordable and, through Aldi's partnership, encourages people of all ages to come and have a go, or return to riding.'  'Who knows, maybe we will find a budding International Event rider to join our team.'  Keeping a horse is an expensive business, with an average horse owner will spend between £3,000 and £10,000.  Aldi's joint managing director for corporate buying, Julie Ashfield, added: 'We believe that cost should never lead to compromise.  'Our competitively priced equestrian clothing ranges have proven extremely popular in the past, and this year, we want to go one gallop further in making horse riding more accessible for all.

'There's no definition of a superfood, which makes it really confusing for people,' she said.  Scroll down for video  LEAFY GREENS  Kale became popular years ago, with many people palming it off as a passing fad, but it is a healthy addition to any diet.  The leafy green is high in folate and vitamin K, like iceberg lettuce, and although it has a good amount of fibre, spinach has more.  'Spinach actually contains more iron than kale does too,' Amelia explained.  Unfortunately what some people don't realise is that when you blend fruit and vegetables their fibre content decreases.  'I really encourage people to eat food rather than drink it, because when you're eating, you're chewing, and you're actually getting really full from the fibre, your gut is having to work,' Amelia said.  OLIVE OIL  Coconut oil is another item that has been deemed a 'superfood', but Amelia doesn't think it deserves that title.  'There is no benefit from coconut oil in cooking. if anything it'll just increase your bad cholesterol in your blood,' Amelia warned.  'You're far better off eating olive oil, avocado oil, canola oil and rice bran oil.  'There are lots of options that are much cheaper and much better for you.'

Although coconut water is rich in nutrients and is definitely good for you, studies have shown that it doesn't do any better a job of hydrating you than water.

A senior US official said today that the European Union and six other countries will be exempt from steel and aluminium tariffs announced by President Trump, at least temporarily.  But Robert Lighthizer's claim that President Trump had decided to 'pause' the import duties while further discussions took place could not assuage traders' concerns as Mr Trump prepared restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on nearly $50billion worth of Chinese imports.  According to the Press Association the move is to 'punish Beijing for stealing American technology and pressuring US companies to hand it over'.  China is already warning it will take 'all necessary measures' to defend itself, raising the prospect of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.  Aside from the EU, Mr Lighthizer said Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea would be exempted from tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium are due to come into effect on Friday.  The London market was already down when the US stock market opened sharply lower, which fed back to more selling in London.  American technology stocks slumped in the wake of Facebook's data privacy scandal, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling 87.81 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 7,257.47.  Facebook's share price continued to fall following weekend's news that Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50million Facebook users to try to sway US elections.  Today, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg broke the silence by apologising for the mistakes his company made in how it handled the data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.  'This was a major breach of trust. I'm really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data,' Zuckerberg told CNN.  The Dow Jones was also down 1.2 per cent and the S&P was 0.7 per cent lower.  On the continent, the German and French leading blue-chip indices were down 1.8 and 1.6 per cent respectively.\",\n",
       " '22 women honored for contributions; Peggy Ruhlin, Rianka Dorsainvil among InvestmentNews\\' Women to Watch Twenty-two women were recognized for their contributions to the financial advice industry last Tuesday at InvestmentNews\\' third annual Women to Watch luncheon.  Peggy Ruhlin, the chief executive of Budros Ruhlin & Roe, accepted the Alexandra Armstrong Award for Lifetime Achievement and encouraged all the women in the room to \"dream big, then make it happen.\"  Ms. Ruhlin is perhaps best known for engineering the merger of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners and the International Association for Financial Planning to create what is known today as the Financial Planning Association.  She\\'s also known as an advocate for women in finance. At Budros Ruhlin & Roe, Ms. Ruhlin has pushed the firm to hire and develop female professionals, and serve female clients.  \"Her forward-looking approach and get-it-done attitude, along with the numerous major accomplishments she has spearheaded, are among the many reasons Peggy is our Lifetime Achievement award honoree this year,\" said Suzanne Siracuse, publisher of InvestmentNews.  In accepting the award, Ms. Ruhlin thanked her colleagues and raised a toast to her family, saying she lives by the motto, \"Nothing is more important than family.\"  As part of the award, InvestmentNews donated $5,000 to the Foundation for Financial Planning, a charity selected by Ms. Ruhlin.  This year\\'s Women to Watch included a new \"Rising Star\" award to honor an emerging leader and role model for next-generation advisers: Rianka Dorsainvil, the founder of Your Greatest Contribution, a fee-only financial planning firm.  CHANGING THE IMPOSSIBLE  \"Being the first at anything is pretty scary. It means you are setting the stage and foundation for those to come after you,\" Ms. Dorsainvil said. \"To the ladies in the audience who will also be the first at something, being the first means you look at the 10-letter word \\'impossible\\' and change it to \\'I\\'m possible.\\'\"  Before the luncheon, the 2017 honorees joined honorees from 2015 and 2016 for a discussion on how to improve financial literacy for women of all ages. The goal was to identify some small changes that could make a difference in the world if embraced by many, such as introducing high school students to financial planning as a career opportunity.  Caitlyn Gimler, a student at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, told the group that a personal finance class at her high school, which was created thanks to a donation from Pershing CEO Mark Tibergien, helped inspire her to pursue a career in financial planning instead of law.  Ms. Gimler said that none of the girls at her high school had named finance or even business when asked what they wanted to do in life, and she thinks programs like Women to Watch could change that.  \"Having women in this career is really important,\" she said. \"It\\'s up to us to do something about that. We have the resources to do it.\"  Twitter: @ryanwneal',\n",
       " 'News Univ. execs get multiple checks Top CUNY administrators have aced their lessons on multiplying - their salaries.  Executives are getting around state rules that place strict limits on \"double dipping\" and are pulling down two six-figure incomes every year.  Marc Shaw retired as a senior CUNY vice chancellor in 2013 at age 59 and began collecting his $131,614 pension.  Last year Shaw, who had been first deputy to Mayor Michael Bloomberg and adviser to former Gov. David Paterson, was named CUNY\\'s interim COO.  Rather than CUNY paying him directly, his $250,000 salary comes from the CUNY Research Foundation, which is a nonprofit that receives taxpayer funds.  By paying him through the foundation, CUNY circumvented a requirement that state retirees younger than 65 need a special waiver in order to earn more than $30,000 in income from a state job.  A CUNY spokesman said Shaw was asked to continue working because of his \"extraordinary talent and understanding of public policy and finance.\"  Two other retirees joined CUNY before they turned 65 and were paid with Research Foundation money, circumventing the waiver process, public records show.  n  Burton Sacks (near right), who is now 70, spent three decades with the now defunct New York City Board of Education and was its former chief executive. His pension comes to $160,138 a year.  He joined CUNY in 2008, and his salary as deputy vice chancellor for operations - now $198,197 - comes from the Research Foundation.  n  Judith Bergtraum (far right), 68, who joined CUNY in 2007 and is vice chancellor for facilities planning, construction and management, gets a $153,598 pension from her time in city government, including a stint as a deputy commissioner in the Department of Transportation. She is paid $215,000 for her CUNY job, with all but $61,000 of her salary coming from the Research Foundation.  The state Inspector General has been investigating non-profit foundations affiliated with CUNY schools. The Research Foundation is funded mostly with government grants.  The waivers for retirees are difficult to secure and designed for those jobs that would be hard to fill.  \"There are people who legitimately retire and leave and then get recruited to come back and maybe they do fill a position for a year or something while they try and hire the right person,\" said Tim Hoefer, the executive director of the Empire Center for Public Policy. \"That\\'s the way the waivers were designed to work. That\\'s not how it is in practice currently.\"  A CUNY spokesman defended the double dipping, saying, \"Without an incentive to keep them out of retirement, it would be nearly impossible to bring on or retain staff who, because of their wealth of experience and expertise, are uniquely qualified for critical roles within the university.\"  As part of efforts to \"create greater transparency\" all of the administrators except Shaw will be paid with state money as of May, the spokesman said.  mklein@nypost.com   Burton Sacks; Judith Bergtraum.',\n",

We are considering releasing some equity in our home to provide extra income but rates of interest on such schemes seem usuriously high to us and, while in one sense that\\'s no problem as the debt would be capped at a certain level and only fall due after our deaths, a likely outcome if we live several years or have to go into a nursing home is that we\\'ll have nothing to leave to our children, who are currently helping their own children with rents, and are strapped for cash.  We would never have been able to buy our home without small timely legacies from elder family members, and it doesn\\'t sit well with us to think we might be unable to do the same. We have also been very cautious about debt all our lives and feel uneasy about taking one on now. Do you have any thoughts? R and P, SOMERSET  Dear R and P What do you need? That is the only question you should be asking yourselves at the moment. I doubt if your children want you to be going without, or even not enjoying your old age to the full, just so that you can leave them something in your will. I know you benefited from a legacy, but I imagine the circumstances were very different. Ultimately, if any of your children think that waiting for you to die is some sort of \"get rich quick\" scheme then I feel you have gone very wrong as parents.  Nowadays people have different attitudes to money and debt but you are from another generation. If the idea of releasing equity through a loan bothers you, you could look at downsizing. I know you love your home, but ask yourselves some hard questions. Is it fit for purpose? Is it larger than you really need? Will you end up spending the money you borrow trying to maintain it?  None of us knows what will happen in the future and it is very difficult to plan when you haven\\'t got all the information you need. Will you stay healthy? What is going to happen to property prices? At this point in your lives I imagine you have no desire to gamble, so together you must come up with a plan that meets your needs. In an ideal scenario you might leave this world with a windfall for others, but the people who love you will want to see you happy in this life.  If you can avoid being a burden to your children, then I think you\\'ve done pretty well - and, when the time comes, people will be crying at your funeral because they miss you, not because they didn\\'t get anything in the will.

Jo Johnson acknowledged that some passengers do suffer additional losses due to delays or cancellations and said they should \"claim accordingly\".  This is despite the Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train companies, insisting it is \"very unlikely\" such claims will be successful.  Train firms to \\'rewrite compensation rules\\' to stop passengers being \\'misled\\'  The Consumer Rights Act, which came into force for the rail industry in October 2016, means passengers can theoretically claim from consequential losses - additional expenses - above the price of the ticket when a train service is not provided with reasonable care and skill.  But the RDG says this is \"a very high legal hurdle to clear\".

Asked by the Press Association if passengers should be entitled to recoup money spent on taxis and hotel rooms, Mr Johnson replied: \"There will be consequential impacts for passengers in certain circumstances and it\\'s right the conditions of travel are now making that clear to passengers, so that they can claim accordingly.\"  He added: \"In law they do have certain rights as consumers.\"  New law to give instant and automatic compensation for train delays coming  Cheap rail travel tips  The RDG encourages passengers to claim compensation through the delay repay scheme, which entitles them to payouts based on the length of delay, the type of ticket and the operator responsible.  It says the amount of compensation being paid to passengers has increased five-fold in the past five years to £74 million.  Alex Hayman, managing director of public markets at Which?, said: \"It\\'s good to see the rail minister backing passengers who should be able to claim for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses when their train service has been disrupted and it is the fault of the train companies.  \"Train companies can no longer hide behind misleading terms to avoid compensating passengers and should proactively inform people about their rights.

       " 'Owners of Maine inns will file for bankruptcy to avoid foreclosure auctions Inns in Portland and Camden are scheduled for foreclosure auctions at the end of next month, but a co-owner of both inns said owners will file for bankruptcy to prevent the auctions from taking place.  The Camden Harbour Inn, and its restaurant Natalie\\'s, and the Portland-based Danforth Inn, and its restaurant Tempo Dulu, are up for foreclosure auction on March 29.  Co-owner Raymond Brunyanszki of Portland said he and his business partner, Oscar Verest, never received a notice from Bar Harbor Bank and Trust -- which holds the mortgages for both inns -- that the two properties were slated for auction.  But an attorney representing Bar Harbor Bank and Trust said the bank\\'s law firm notified the owners\\' attorney that the bank would be publishing foreclosure auction notices in local publications. Charles Remmel, said they gave the first notice well before the mandated 21 days of notice.  Brunyanszki said the inns\\' owners are working on filing for protection under Chapter 11 bankruptcy for both businesses in order to halt the foreclosure auctions and allow for continuing negotiations with the bank.  \"This is more a matter of principle and we will try to continue to solve this issue,\" Brunyanszki said Monday. \"We hope to stay in Chapter 11 [bankruptcy] as short as possible.\"  Brunyanszki said the current situation is the result of an \"ongoing disagreement\" between the LLCs that operate the inns and Bar Harbor Bank and Trust. Breda LLC operates the Camden Harbour Inn and Natalie\\'s. Tempo Dulu LLC operates the Danforth Inn and Tempo Dulu restaurant.  Brunyanszki could not elaborate on the nature of the disagreement, but he alleges that Bar Harbor Bank and Trust made commitments that it has not fulfilled, costing the businesses about $1 million in added expenses during the past year.  The bank denies failing to abide by the agreement and said that financial trouble for the two LLCs dates to December 2016, according to Remmel. He said the bank has \"tried to work with them\" but that the businesses eventually failed to comply. \"The defaults go back quite a long ways,\" Remmel said.  Brunyanszki said the businesses are in fine financial standing and hope they are able to negotiate a contract that is favorable for both parties. Otherwise, Brunyanszki said the inns\\' owners are prepared to let a judge decide what is fair.  Brunyanszki and Verest bought the Camden property in 2007 for about $2.8 million. In 2013-2014, the owners pumped another $1 million into the Camden Harbour Inn for renovations. Their banking relationship with Bar Harbor Bank and Trust began at about that time.  The Camden Harbour Inn, a 20-room high-end inn on Bayview Street, has been operating since the late 1800s. In 2014, Brunyanszki and Verest bought the nine-room Danforth Inn in Portland\\'s West End.

Even though the pharmacy\\'s own brand range of products is made in the UK, US shoppers are scooping a hefty discount on the exact same products, the Mirror found.

       " 'Pensions Relief for final salary members as pension deficits halve in a month A \"perfect cocktail\" of rising interest rates and stock markets has wiped £50bn from the deficits of Britain\\'s \"final salary\" pension funds over the past month alone.  Corporate schemes must meet the pension promises made to retired staff - but in recent years the value of liabilities has far outweighed schemes\\' assets. As a result most have been in deficit since the financial crisis.  But the latest figures from the Pension Protection Fund, the statutory \"lifeboat\" fund, show that the combined deficit of Britain\\'s nearly 6,000 schemes fell from £104bn to £51bn at the end of January.  Shortfalls are at their lowest level since the start of 2014. The schemes\\' aggregate funding ratio, a measure of how assets cover liabilities, increased from 94pc to 97pc.  The recent high-profile collapse of firms with large final salary schemes such as BHS and Carillion has thrust the security of legacy pension funds into the spotlight and left members fearing for their retirement income.  Although pensions paid by failed companies are guaranteed by the PPF, there has been a steep rise in the numbers of people transferring out of schemes.  The PPF values liabilities on the basis of how much it would cost to insure the pensions on the open market. The yield on government bonds is the main factor, with even tiny movements adding or deducting billions of pounds from liabilities.  What is the Pension Protection Fund? According to the PPF, the dramatic fall in deficits was caused by a small increase in the yield on 15-year gilts, which offset a small decrease in the overall value of assets.  Markets falls in recent weeks are likely to have reversed some of those gains already, but it is too early to see the effect of this in the PPF\\'s analysis.  Calum Cooper of Hymans Robertson, a pensions consultancy, said the fall was caused by a \"perfect cocktail of steady stock market returns as a result of enthusiasm around President Trump\\'s tax reforms, as well as modest increases in gilt yields\".  However, he warned that in isolation the figure did not paint an accurate picture of the health of schemes.  The UK\\'s pensions timebomb: which companies have the biggest black holes? \"When the industry starts measuring what matters - the chances of members receiving the pensions they expect in good times and bad - instead of just deficits, we\\'ll develop investment, covenant [the strength of the guarantees offered by the companies behind the schemes] and funding strategies that will sustainably improve these outcomes for our pensioners,\" he said.  Companies supporting schemes with deficits are required to produce a \"recovery plan\", approved by the pensions regulator, usually every three years. This makes the timing of the valuation incredibly important.  These recovery plans normally lead to millions of pounds of extra funding, which firms have argued prevents them from reinvesting in their business.  sam.brodbeck@telegraph.co.uk',\n",
       " 'News Carillion \\'trampled over rights of pension scheme members\\' - Frank Field A joint hearing of the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee and the Work and Pensions Committee will examine events  Executives from collapsed construction giant Carillion face a tough grilling as they appear before MPs on Tuesday.  A joint hearing of the Commons Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee and the Work and Pensions Committee will examine events leading up to the business failure which has led to the loss of more than 800 jobs.  Ahead of the session, Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field said: \"It is clear that the directors of this company trampled over the rights of their tens of thousands of pension scheme members.  \"Their main focus was paying out fat dividends and bonuses that exceeded their cash flow, all the while stiffing their suppliers, borrowing mega sums of money, and allowing their liabilities and pension deficit to balloon to ruinous levels.  \"Clear warning signs were evident several years ago in the assessments of the company\\'s commitment to its pension schemes.  \"Yet as late as 2015, Richard Adam, one of the directors appearing before us ... gave a farcically optimistic report to the pension trustees.\"  377 staff to be made redundant after Carillion collapse  The two committees published documents from Carillion\\'s pension covenant assessors, Gazelle Corporate Finance, going back to 2012, which MPs claim \"flag up a number of warning signs about the company\\'s position and illustrate the chronic underfunding of the schemes and the low priority Carillion directors gave their pension obligations\".  The hearings come after a further 452 jobs were lost as a result of the collapse.  Hundreds more job losses after Carillion collapse  The Official Receiver said the jobs cover a variety of roles connected with private and public contracts across the country, as well as back office functions.  The losses are on top of 377 announced on Friday.

       " 'Small change could mean big savings for families A major expansion of a little-known tax break could offer significant help to some local parents, though the bulk of the benefit is likely years away.  The 529 plan, which allows families to save money for education tax-free, was significantly expanded by the federal tax overhaul signed into law in December. Previously, 529s only applied to saving for college; families can now use 529 funds to pay for private elementary, middle and high school tuition.  While the change sounds like it could help more families send their children to private schools, local and national experts expressed skepticism on how large the impact would be.  \"Maybe in some families\\' cases, it would give them the opportunity to afford private school when they couldn\\'t otherwise, [but] I don\\'t think we\\'re expecting a dramatic effect - a dramatic increase in enrollment,\" said Briarcrest Christian School president Mark Merrill.  Campaign for School Equity director Mendell Grinter, whose Memphis-based organization advocates that low-income families need access to high- quality education choices, said the expansion is unlikely to help the families he works with.  U.S. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos shares the sentiment.  \"Anything that empowers parents and gives them more opportunities is a good thing, but [the 529 expansion] doesn\\'t address the needs of parents who are from lower incomes and does not empower them in significant ways,\" DeVos said, according to multiple media reports.  Tom Hood, president of St. Agnes Academy-St. Dominic School, said local private schools are a couple of years away from knowing whether the expansion will have any impact on enrollment.  Hood, Merrill and Kyle Gowen, director of investments for Duncan Williams Asset Management, all think it will have more of an effect on families who already send their children to private schools and likely already use 529 plans to save for college. Gowen, whose clients often choose private schools for their kids, said he expects those families to become more proactive about putting large sums of money into the 529 plans sooner.  Merrill is hopeful the expansion will benefit Briarcrest families, especially those with younger children. He emphasized families with younger children because the plan\\'s primary benefit is its allowance for savings to grow tax-free year after year. The hope is, if families with young children start investing in a 529 plan now, it could help them pay for private school in the future.  Since the families who will be helped most by the expansion are primarily wealthier than families whose children attend public schools, the expansion has been criticized by many.  \"I have yet to find a specific part of the tax code that is more skewed to the affluent than 529s,\" Richard Reeves, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told CNN Money.

Along with a new gym membership and spring clean of your house, now is a good time to give your finances a thorough going over too.  Savings can be made in the unlikeliest of places and a good look at your household bills might throw up the chance to save a few quid.  According to the Office for National Statistics, the average family spends £7.40 a week on water, £11.50 on electricity or £10.70 on gas.  So what can be done to shave off the spends this January?  Here, we look at seven ways to save money on your household bills.  It might sound simple but late payment fees can wipe out hard-earned savings so make sure you pay your bills on time.  It is also advisable to pay for regular bills monthly by direct debit, keep a record of payments and plan ahead.  You can reduce your energy bills and get cashback on top in minutes, according to Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis.  He writes: \"Remember, it\\'s the same gas, same electricity, same pipes and safety; only the price and billing processes really change.\"  Check if you\\'re in one of up to 400,000 households in England and Scotland who\\'ve overpaid their council tax by being in the wrong band.  Taking ten minutes out now to check you\\'re in the correct band is well worth the effort.  Shopping for food is very much part of the household expenditure but even slight behavioural changes can save you cash.  Firstly, swap the premium shops like Waitrose and M&S Food to cheaper supermarket chains - use them only for treat items.  Also, try to beat the psychology of the supermarket experience by not just buying brands that are stocked at eye level as these tend to be the most profitable.  Almost 60 per cent of homes are sticking to the big six standard energy tariffs and typically overpaying by more than £300+ a year.  It may take a bit of searching and comparison work but changing suppliers could save you a fortune.  Prices are very rarely set in stone when it comes to household bill providers so don\\'t be shy when it comes to paying the best price.  For things like broadband or your mobile phone provider, if you are out of contract or nearing the end of it, you could try to haggle your plan.  With stiff competition in the marketplace, companies are frantically trying to keep hold of customers - use this to your advantage.  This is often the forgotten utility that many people think they can\\'t save on.  However, by fitting a water meter and cutting down on use people have slashed hundreds of pounds off their bills.  It\\'s worth a try.',\n",

A report from Willis Towers Watson shows that the funded ratio for defined benefit pension plans at Fortune 1000 firms rose to 83% at the end of 2017 from 81% posted at the same time of 2016. Company contributions jumped to $51 billion last year from $43 billion in 2016, with deficits of these pension plans dropping to $293 billion in 2017 from $317 billion recorded the previous year.  The unexpected resiliency of retirement assets  A study by the BlackRock Retirement Institute and the Employee Benefit Research Institute has found that most present-day retirees have preserved 80% of their savings even after nearly 20 years since they retired, according to this article on Nasdaq. More than a third of these retirees even saw an increase in their retirement assets, the study found. While current retirees manage to keep their finances afloat, the case might be different for future retirees because of factors that include increased longevity, decline in pension and financial woes facing Social Security.  One thing clients can do now to improve odds of retiring soon  To improve their chance of retiring early, seniors should do a quick assessment of their retirement prospects even while still working, writes an expert for Money. Those who have already retired should strive to find ways to enjoy their savings and have a rewarding retirement, writes the expert. \"To the extent you can resolve to examine your retirement spending over the coming year and look for tweaks that can give you a bigger happiness bang for your buck, the better your chances of having a satisfying and enjoyable retirement.\"  5 steps to play retirement catch-up  Clients are advised to catch up on retirement if they are not confident about their prospects, according to this article from Forbes. This means that they should make their financial plan up-to-date, make the most of the tax breaks offered by their retirement accounts and put retirement saving ahead of their children\\'s needs. They should also pay off their debt as early as possible and free more funds for a savings plan. Doing a dry-run of retirement is also recommended so they can make changes to their financial plan and better prepare for the golden years.

       " 'Student borrowers under most stress in New York City\\'s poorest areas NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York\\'s poorest neighborhoods are home to the city\\'s student borrowers under the most stress, according to a central bank report released on Friday showing \"troublingly high\" loan default and delinquency rates mainly in the Bronx and Brooklyn.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York report, billed as the first neighborhood-level study of student loans in any U.S. city, showed that borrowers in New York had on average $34,900 in debt, 18 percent above the national average. About 1 million, or 15 percent, of residents had loans, totaling $34.8 billion of the country\\'s $1.3 trillion in student debt.  Borrowers aged 45 and older and those with lower student loan balances struggled the most, the report on the largest U.S. city found. Bronx borrowers had an average balance of $14,784 compared with $21,483 for those in Manhattan.  Student loans account for a growing share of the total U.S. debt of $12.8 trillion, and delinquency rates have remained stubbornly high since 2004, a trend that has perplexed and concerned some policymakers.  The report suggests poorer borrowers are bearing the brunt of this trend that New York Fed President William Dudley has warned could ultimately hurt overall U.S. home ownership and consumer spending. Delinquencies and defaults damage borrowers\\' credit reports, hampering their ability to make investments and climb the economic ladder.  New York\\'s lower-income neighborhoods had disproportionately high delinquency and default rates, and successful repayments varied widely across its five boroughs and many neighborhoods, the report found. The New York Fed defined low-income areas as those with residents earning less than $35,900 annually, while high-income was more than $72,301.  The Bronx, the northernmost borough with the city\\'s lowest median household income of $35,302 last year, had the most student-loan distress and was home to four of the five neighborhoods with the highest default rates, the report said. They included Belmont, Crotona Park East and Hunts Point. The other neighborhood, Brownsville/Ocean Hill, is in Brooklyn, in the city\\'s southeast, which had $50,640 in median income according to the U.S. Census Bureau.  The lowest-income neighborhoods had a 20 percent delinquency rate, more than twice that of the highest income neighborhoods, particularly Manhattan which had a median household income of $75,513 last year.  More than half of student borrowers in high-income areas reported successfully paying down their loans, compared with about a quarter in low-income areas.  \"We hope that this report will serve as a foundation for policymakers and other stakeholders to develop pragmatic solutions that can provide relief to struggling borrowers,\" the authors wrote.  The report, based on the New York Fed\\'s consumer credit data, urged programs to assist with enrollment and educate borrowers on repayment programs.

       " \"Workers weigh pension opt-out as contributions set to rise Around 12% of workers are thinking of opting out of their workplace pension when minimum contributions rise next April, according to insurer Aviva. However, the majority look set to stay put.  Reported in The Daily Telegraph, research by insurer Aviva of 2,007 private sector workers found that 4% of people had already decided they would opt out of their workplace pension next year, while 50% said they planned to stay enrolled.  As it stands, minimum auto-enrolment contributions are 2% (split equally between employee and employer). Next April it will rise to an employer minimum of 2% and employee minimum contribution of 3%; 5% in total. Then in 2019 it will rise again to 8% in total; 3% from the employer and 5% from employee.  Aviva has already called for the government to raise the minimum contribution much higher, to 12.5% by 2028.  Research carried out by Citywire earlier this year showed an 8% total contribution would still leave savers short of a £200,000-plus pot by retirement. Previous pensions minister, Richard Harrington said £200,000 was about the amount people should be aiming to save by retirement.  The average salary in the UK is just under £27,000, according to the Office for National Statistics, and Harrington assumed people wanted to retire on two-thirds of their salary.  With the new state pension of around £8,000 per year, there would be a £10,000 per year gap to make up annual retirement incomes of £18,000.  Auto-enrolment was introduced in 2012, since when over 8.5 million people have joined a workplace scheme.  The policy has so far been viewed as a resounding success, turning around free-falling participation rates to a point where the vast majority now save into some form of workplace pension.  Recently the economist, Richard Thaler, whose nudge theory inspired auto-enrolment, was awarded a Nobel prize.  However, a review of the policy is underway and new challenges have emerged over the years since auto-enrolment was launched.  Earnings have not risen as quickly as had been anticipated when auto-enrolment was given the green light in 2010, and the intervening years have also seen the rise of the so-called 'gig economy'.  Writing in The Times, Paul Johnson, director for the Institute of Fiscal Studies, said in 2010 earnings were expected to soon recover to pre-recession levels, but instead 'that has failed to happen to a spectacular degree'.  He said: 'What is worrying for government is that earnings are again rising less quickly than prices, while automatic contribution rates are due to rise? Whether present coverage rates of 90% or so will survive these increases remains to be seen. If they do, one consequence will be an even bigger squeeze on earnings and on take-home pay. The power of inertia could see income, consumption and living standards suffer more than was ever envisaged by the architects of the scheme'.\",\n",

Christina Slade, who was vicechancellor of Bath Spa University until August 2017, was paid a salary of £250,000 in 2016-17, but received an additional £429,000 as \"compensation for loss of office\", the university\\'s latest financial statements show.  Professor Slade also received a housing allowance of £20,000, other benefits in kind worth £20,000 and pension contributions of £89,000 in her last year, which took her overall remuneration package to £808,000, according to the Times Higher Education newspaper.  News of the package emerged as the higher education watchdog announced that it was investigating the retirement terms for the departing vice-chancellor of the University of Bath, which are also the subject of growing opposition among professors on campus.  The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) said it had begun \"initial inquiries\" after a complaint into governance issues and how the terms were agreed for Dame Glynis Breakwell, 65.  It is understood that the complaint surrounds the way the terms of retirement were reached between council members days before the full council met. Dame Glynis will continue to receive her £468,000 salary package until February 2019, first as vice-chancellor until August next year and then for six months on a paid sabbatical.  Dame Glynis\\'s retirement package is eclipsed by that of her neighbour. Professor Slade, 64, who is from Australia, was almost certainly the UK\\'s highest paid vice-chancellor in 2016-17 with her overall pay package almost 75 per cent higher than the £468,000 in pay and benefits. The pay-off is believed to be a record for a UK university and will intensify calls for tougher scrutiny of uni-versity vice-chancellors\\' pay. Bath Spa, which has only 7,300 students, said that it had taken account of \"relevant HEFCE guidance\" before making the award. However, in June HEFCE warned that enhanced severance packages \"should not as a rule be provided out of public funds\" and must not reward poor performance.  A Bath Spa University spokeswoman added that its remuneration committee, which does not include the vicechancellor, was \"mindful of the need to respond to concerns about excessive salaries\".  Professor Slade\\'s performance appears to be mixed. In September 2017, international student numbers at the university fell by 30 per cent and domestic and EU intake dipped to 2,100, while two subsidiary companies, Bath Spa U and Bath Spa Global, ran up significant losses, annual accounts show. Sally Hunt, of the University and College Union, said: \"We are seeing what happens when decisions are taken in secret without proper checks and balances. This cannot be allowed to continue; we need an urgent overhaul of how senior pay and perks are determined, and how universities are governed.\"',\n",
       " \"Ponderosa Energy Files Chapter 11 to Avert Foreclosure Oil production company Ponderosa Energy LLC and affiliate GS Energy LLC filed for Chapter 11 protection to stave off foreclosure of their assets after their lender Petroleum Production Finance Inc. declared a default on their loans.  The New York-based debtors on Tuesday, Dec. 5, filed their petition in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York in Manhattan along with a motion seeking authorization of joint administration of their cases.  Judge Sean H. Lane had not scheduled any hearings for the case as of Tuesday afternoon.  Debtor counsel Charles M. Rubio of Diamond McCarthy LLP was not immediately available for comment.  Representatives of Petroleum Production Finance also were not available for comment.  The debtors, which own oil and gas leases in Texas, in 2016 entered into a secured financing agreements with entities affiliated with Petroleum Production Finance Inc.  The debtors owe lenders PPF 2 LLC and PPF 3 LLC about $4.61 million in loans structured as volumetric production payments. Instead of fixed cash payments, the lender is entitled to monthly revenue from a fixed quantity of future oil production.  The debtors retained ownership of its oil leases, while the lender received a lien on the oil produced from the property's wells. The oil is conveyed to the lender when the facility is funded. The debtor alleged that the secured financing is disguised as a sale of property.  The lender alleged that the VPP structure would be less expensive than an asset-backed loan agreement, but PPF declared a default and sought to foreclose on the debtors' property after the leases produced less oil than expected, according to court papers. <story_page_break />  The debtors had obtain price protection on its oil as part of the financing agreement, which provided oil price rebates to the debtors of 75% of any amount that rose above $28 per barrel.  The debtors allege that the lender engaged in fraudulent, tortious and usurious predatory lending, as it did not pay the debtors millions of dollars in rebates to which they claim to be owed from higher oil prices. They allege the lender failed to provide them with a balance of outstanding debt, refused to provide accurate accounting of the number of barrels delivered and sold, and prevented the debtor from further investing in properties by threatening to foreclose on its assets.  Ponderosa also alleged that the lender did not give prior notice of the alleged default. It also allegedly refused to negotiate any settlement with the debtors.  The debtor filed for Chapter 11 protection to restructure its debts, halt the foreclosure and provide a forum to resolve claims against the lender.  The debtors listed $1 million to $10 million in assets and liabilities in its petition. Their largest unsecured creditors include BP Energy Co. (BP) (owed $628,000), Hutchinson County Tax Office ($33,508), CRL Pump & Supply ($26,877), Midwest Compressor systems ($20,418) and Chase Production Co. ($20,270).\",\n",
       " 'Press Release Survey Highlights Need for Kiwis to Plan for Retirement Survey Highlights Need for New Zealanders to Plan for Retirement  ANZ Investments is urging New Zealanders to ensure they are on track for a comfortable retirement, following the release of research showing most people will have to live on just New Zealand Superannuation after 10 years of retirement.  The research, commissioned by the Financial Services Council (FSC), found there is a $218 average after tax weekly gap between what the retired think they need to live comfortably and what they will have.  The research by the FSC also found that those who do expect to have enough to live comfortably are those whose assets are more diversified. However, this is not the case for many New Zealanders.  \"We agree with the FSC that people saving for their retirement need more education on the best ways to maximise their savings and to broaden their investments. It\\'s never too early to start planning,\" said ANZ General Manager of Wealth Products Ana-Marie Lockyer.  That view is shared by the Financial Markets Authority (FMA). \"These results reflect what our own work has shown makes people more confident they are prepared for retirement. Starting early, at least 10 years out, and getting help from an adviser, provider or a mix of sources got the best results,\" said Paul Gregory, the FMA\\'s Director of External Communications and Investor Capability.  ANZ is working with the FMA and the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment (MBIE) on a behavioural insights trial designed to help people aged 55-64 make informed decisions about their retirement.  \"The results from the behavioural insights trial with ANZ will help refine our view of what prompts KiwiSaver members to better prepare for their retirement,\" said Mr Gregory.  Randomly selected members are receiving targeted communications encouraging them to either check they are on track for retirement by using ANZ\\'s online calculators, or seek financial advice. Six months into the pilot, the results show few are taking matters into their own hands and even fewer are seeking professional advice, even when the advice is free.  \"We\\'ve targeted those 10 years out from retirement, hoping to encourage active choices around the level of contributions they are making and how best to maximise their assets. However, results suggest there is still strong apathy when it comes to retirement planning,\" Mrs Lockyer said.  The FSC study found nearly four in 10 retirees regret not having more financial advice. Among those aged 65 and older, 19% wanted advice on how to invest their KiwiSaver funds and 22% would like providers to offer more advice about how to draw down their savings.  \"ANZ agrees with the FSC and the FMA that there is a need for financial advice to be more accessible. We are working hard to make our members aware of the range of options that are available - from class to personalised advice, online, face-to-face and on the phone,\" Mrs Lockyer said.  ENDS',\n",
       " 'US Pending Home Sales Jump Much More Than Expected In October Primarily reflecting a bounce back in the South after hurricane-related disruptions in the previous month, the National Association of Realtors released a report on Wednesday showing a bigger than expected jump in pending home sales in the US in the month of October.  NAR said its pending home sales index surged up by 3.5% to 109.3 in October after dipping by 0.4% to a downwardly revised 105.6 in September. Economists had expected pending home sales to climb by 1.0%.  A pending home sale is one in which a contract was signed but not yet closed. Normally, it takes four to six weeks to close a contracted sale.  With the much bigger than expected increase, the pending home sales index reached its highest reading since June but is still 0.6% lower than a year ago.  \"Last month`s solid increase in contract signings were still not enough to keep activity from declining on an annual basis for the sixth time in seven months,\" said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.  He added, \"Home shoppers had better luck finding a home to buy in October, but slim pickings and consistently fast price gains continue to frustrate and prevent too many would-be buyers from reaching the market.\"  The bigger than expected increase in pending home sales came as pending sales in the South spiked by 7.4% in October after slumping by 3.0% in September.  Pending home sales in the Midwest also showed a notable 2.8% increase, while pending sales in the Northeast edged up by 0.5%. On the other hand, pending sales in the West fell by 0.7%.  Yun forecast existing home sales to finish at around 5.52 million for the year, which would be an increase of 1.3% from 2016. The national median existing home price is expected to increase around 6%.  On Monday, the Commerce Department released a report showing an unexpected jump in new home sales in the month of October.  The report showed new home sales surged up by 6.2% to an annual rate of 685,000 in October from the revised September rate of 645,000.  The notable increase surprised economists, who had expected new home sales to drop to a rate of 625,000 from the 667,000 originally reported for the previous month.  With the unexpected increase, new home sales reached their highest annual rate since hitting 727,000 in October of 2007.  NAR released a separate report last Tuesday showing existing home sales jumped by much more than anticipated in the month of October.  The report said existing home sales surged up by 2.0% to an annual rate of 5.48 million in October from a downwardly revised 5.37 million in September.  Economists had expected existing home sales to climb by 0.7% to a rate of 5.43 million from the 5.39 million originally reported for the previous month.',\n",

According to the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) decision, Mr G completed a form in November 2016 notifying Prudential of his intention to take his pension benefits once he turned 75. Confusion over his correct home address followed between him and his adviser and Prudential.  Upholding the complaint, the FOS concluded the delay caused to the payment of Mr G\\'s pension was due to Prudential not updating his address details. The investigator said this caused Mr G a great deal of stress, and said Prudential should pay him £250 in compensation.  Prudential disagreed with the adjudicator\\'s view. It agreed it caused some delays, but argued other delays were caused by Mr G. It also said it did not believe Mr G had lost out financially as a result. It thought £100 in compensation would be fairer.  The final verdict lay with ombudsman Nadya Chandra, who upheld Mr G\\'s complaint. She said Mr G had not changed his address for several years and, because Prudential sent some information to his correct address and some to an incorrect address, she did not think the incorrect address details were down to Mr G not keeping his address updated.

       " \"Watchdog's resignation puts consumers at risk Maine's senators should resist efforts to replace Richard Cordray with a compliant figurehead.  If you're completely confident that your money and personal information are safe in the hands of the financial services industry - and if you don't have a credit card, a mortgage, a student loan or a bank account - there's no need for concern about the pending resignation of the nation's top consumer advocate.  The rest of us, on the other hand, should be very worried about the near-certainty that the next head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will be someone bent on gutting it rather than ensuring that it's better equipped to do its job.  Richard Cordray's announcement Wednesday that he plans to step down by the end of the month follows a tumultuous first six years for the bureau, the only federal agency solely dedicated to protecting Americans from harmful banking and lending practices.  Banks, mortgage companies, credit card issuers and their Republican allies in Washington have long been critical of the bureau, but their efforts to weaken its oversight of unfair, illegal or predatory practices didn't pay off until Donald Trump was in office.  The Trump administration's approach to financial regulation can be summed up in three words: Foxes, meet henhouse. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, a tea party Republican who's tried to kill the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, could be appointed its acting director as soon as Friday - the day after Joseph Otting, a former banker who was investigated over his bank's home foreclosure practices, was confirmed as the leading regulator of large national lenders.  Former Wall Street lawyers Jay Clayton and Randal Quarles, the industry insiders nominated, respectively, to run the Securities and Exchange Commission and oversee Wall Street's largest banks, had already gotten the green light from the Senate.  Maine's two senators, Republican Susan Collins and independent Angus King, should push back early and often against efforts by the White House to replace Cordray as permanent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau director with a figurehead who would stand by quietly as Congress repeals the bureau's consumer complaint system, reduces its ability to make rules and bars it from penalizing the institutions it regulates - among other proposals to neuter the agency.  The bureau has been a much-needed champion for the average American. It played a key role in investigating Wells Fargo for creating millions of fake customer accounts and fined the bank $185 million. It's returned $60 million to service members charged excess interest on student loans; military families dealing with illegal foreclosures and predatory lenders have gotten back $120 million.  All told, about 29 million Americans have gotten back nearly $12 billion as a result of the bureau's efforts. If Maine's senators help put in place someone whose goal is to undo these safeguards, the people who stand to lose out - their constituents - should be prepared to hold them accountable.\",\n",
       " 'Lifestyle,Money Two Scottish cities are fastest places to sell a house in the whole of the UK Sellers at locations north of the border are enjoying shorter periods on the market than elsewhere.  House sellers can expect theirpropertyto take just over three months to sell, according to a report.  While the average UK home takes 96 days to sell, up from 91 days a year ago, properties in the Scottish cities ofEdinburghandGlasgowwere found to typically spend around half this time on the market before being snapped up, at 41 days and 50 days respectively.  Post Office Money released the findings after commissioning the Centre for Economics and Business Research (Cebr) to look at average selling times across a selection of UK towns and cities.  Fastest cities to sell a home  It found that homes in Liverpool and Belfast take the longest to sell, at 112 days and 119 days respectively.  Homes in London are also taking longer to sell than the average across the urban areas analysed, at 111 days typically.  House prices have risen in each of the cities analysed in this report over the last year, by 5% on average.  Video: 6 Kirklee Terrace townhouse  The areas that\\'ll take you longer to sell up  Owen Woodley, managing director of Post Office Money, said: \"If a sale moves faster, or takes longer than planned, buyers can face unexpected costs.\"  House prices slashed across the country as desperate sellers knock thousands off home values  Here are Post Office Money\\'s top tips for home-buyers:  If you are buying in an area with a slower sale rate, an ability to move faster may provide an opportunity to negotiate with the current owners on the house price.  Think ahead about what stop-gaps such as renting or staying with friends are most financially viable to you if you are in a chain - particularly if sales in your area tend to complete faster than where you are moving to.  Use average sale rates to help plan for extra costs if your home takes longer to sell than expected. Paying council tax, home insurance and service charges on two properties can quickly add up.  If you are currently renting, discuss options with your landlord - just in case you need to stay longer than planned in your rental property.  Post Office Money also has tips for sellers, from NAEA (National Association of Estate Agents) Propertymark:  First impressions are key, so make sure the property looks well-maintained and cared for from the outside.  Anything too personalised can be a turn-off, so keeping colours neutral can help.  Clear your garden of any litter and make sure the lawn is mowed, leaves are raked away, weeds are removed and overgrown trees are cut back.  Giving your kitchen a quick freshen-up is a cost-effective way to improve the appearance of your home. Giving cabinets a quick lick of paint, or replacing the doors and handles can bring instant appeal.  Top news stories today',\n",

THE pound is up against the US dollar this morning (Friday November 17) after October\\'s positive shopping sales data.  Sterling was up 0.39 per cent on 1.3246 after the figures showed a contraction on the year of -0.3 per cent rather than the -0.4 per cent drop forecast.  BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson recently called on Philip Hammond to deliver a budget for shoppers later this month in order to keep spending strong and shore up the UK economy.  She said: \"Considering the intrinsic link between consumer spending and economic growth, the chancellor should reflect on this disappointing state of play and deliver a budget that allays the risks of a further slowdown in consumer spending, by keeping down the cost of living. In other words, a shoppers\\' budget.\"  The Bank of England last week raised interest rates by 0.25 per cent to 0.50 per cent for the first time in ten years after the economy grew more quickly than expected in the third quarter of this year.  Sterling did fall sharply on the day as markets appeared to have fully priced the interest rate rise in a reaction to the announcement.  More fluctuations in the pound to dollar exchange rate are expected as US investors speculate on who will become the next head of the Federal Reserve - the American version of the Bank of England.

Kelly Gray is a regular shopper at one of the budget supermarket\\'s stores in Rochdale but was left baffled when she tried to open one of its cans earlier this week.

       " 'Govt urged to extend salary exchange arrangements to low-paid Employees on low wages should be allowed to share in the benefits of a salary exchange for pensions, according to Royal London and Radcliffe & Co.  On behalf of both firms, Royal London\\'s director of policy Steve Webb wrote a letter to the secretary of state for business energy & industrial strategy MP Greg Clark last month, calling for changes to be made to salary exchange rules, even if it takes low-paid earners\\' wages below the minimum level.  A salary exchange arrangement allows a worker and employer to come to an agreement, whereby pension contributions are made wholly by an employer, rather than split between the employer and employee.  The letter explained how under normal circumstances, any money paid in wages is subject to employer and employee National Insurance Contributions (NICs), even if it is then paid by the worker into a pension scheme.  It was argued if pension contributions were to go directly from the firm into the pension, rather than via the worker, it would reduce the total NICs bill, to the potential benefit of both the worker and the firm.  Webb said: \"Having written to the government about this issue, I hope that they will change the rules and allow lower-paid workers to share in the benefits of these arrangements.  \"It is hard to think that those who wrote the minimum wage legislation wanted to exclude low-paid workers from these potential advantages.\"  He added there is already an exemption for salary exchange type arrangements whereby a worker gets free accommodation as part of their job.  \"Their \\'headline\\' wage can be below the minimum wage level as long as the value of the free accommodation would take them over the minimum.  \"A similar approach should apply to pensions, and the Low Pay Commission should review the current rules in the interest of lower-paid workers and their long-term retirement prospects.  \"Given the Treasury has specifically decided that employer pension contributions should continue to benefit from salary sacrifice arrangements, it seems unfair that lower-paid workers are currently missing out.\"  HM Treasury reviewed the operation of \\'Salary Sacrifice\\' schemes in December 2016.  In that consultation it reported clearance requests for salary sacrifice schemes between 2009/10 and 2014/15 increased by a third.  The National Living Wage is currently £7.50 an hour for the over-25s or £13,650 a year for a 35-hour week.  The Treasury estimates around 2.9 million workers will be on the national living wage rate by 2020.  Radcliffe & Co financial adviser and assistant director Marc Cumberlege argued this is not just a theoretical issue.  \"I who have come across employers want to deliver high quality pension provision to their staff in a cost-effective way and risk falling foul of minimum wage legislation if they do so.  \"Salary exchange arrangements can be mutually beneficial to workers and employers alike and should be available to all.\"  To view photo, click here.',\n",

       " 'Pensions Tide of consultation on the way as minister indicates regulatory timetable A raft of consultations and draft regulations will greet the industry over the coming weeks and months, the pensions and financial inclusion minister confirms.  In the run-up to Christmas, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) will issue consultations on new measures, as well as provide updates on work started earlier in the year.  Speaking at the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association\\'s (PLSA) annual conference on 19 October, Guy Opperman MP said he has \"a very busy period of time up to Christmas\".  \"Going forward, I\\'m pleased to come into this role at a time when there is a great deal of consensus on strategy for pension reform,\" he added. \"I also fully understand the long time horizons involved in pensions. It is clearly a long-term game so we need a well thought-out approach built on solid evidence.\"  Draft regulations for The Pensions Regulator\\'s (TPR) master trust authorisation and supervision regime, which was promised in the Pension Schemes Act 2017, are expected to be consulted on before Christmas, before coming into effect next October.  Meanwhile, the DWP will also consult \"very shortly\" on charge caps and transparency in defined contribution schemes, Opperman confirmed, while a separate consultation on disclosure of costs and charges to DC members will be published \"in due course\".  The department will also respond to a number of consultations it has issued over the past 12 months.  Opperman said he expects to report to Parliament on the much anticipated review of auto-enrolment (AE) - which is covering areas around engagement, coverage and contributions - in the week beginning 4 December.  He added the DWP was also taking over the governmental lead on the dashboard project and that he expected to provide an update next Spring.  Meanwhile, the department has also promised to issue its white paper on defined benefit (DB) security and sustainability late winter and by the end of February.  It will also set out its final views on allowing bulk DC transfers without members\\' consent, which it consulted on last December \"in the next few weeks\".  Finally, the Financial Guidance and Claims Bill - which includes provisions to merge The Pensions Advisory Service, Money Advice Service, and Pension Wise into a single financial guidance body - is expected to receive Royal Assent in spring.  Despite all of the work, however, it may be difficult for pensions legislation to receive parliamentary time. A senior DWP civil servant also told the conference that it would be unlikely for any measures from the DB white paper to be legislated for before the 2020s.  Meanwhile, Opperman said eagerly anticipated measures to tackle scammers, particularly by introduction of a ban on cold-calling, would only be legislated for \"as soon as parliamentary time allows\".  The minister also told the conference the industry needs to \"evangelise pensions and savings\" as one voice.

       " 'Deloitte; Deloitte Survey: Defined Contribution Plan Sponsors Are Maximizing Their Fiduciary Responsibility from Oversight to Participant Experience 2017 OCT 14 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Obesity, Fitness & Wellness Week -- Deloitte\\'s 15th \" Annual Defined Contribution Benchmarking Survey\" found that with current regulatory uncertainty and increasing litigation from plan participants, defined contribution plan sponsors are focusing on their fiduciary responsibilities by shifting investments to lower cost options, utilizing direct fees, and simplifying investment approaches. These actions aim to help participants tackle their future retirement income needs.  With nearly 240 plan sponsors participating, this year\\'s survey indicates an overwhelming push for plan sponsors to determine participant income replacement ratios by conducting retirement readiness assessments. In fact, 35 percent of plan sponsors are doing so, representing a 23 percentage point increase over Deloitte\\'s last survey. The evolving legislative landscape, shifting fiduciary responsibilities and efforts by organizations to optimize their human capital balance sheets are factors driving plan sponsors to simplify offerings and help participants adequately manage their retirement income needs.  \"As contribution and investment decisions move from the hands of finance departments to individual participants, the expertise of plan sponsors has shifted from a financial management role to a keen attention on their fiduciary oversight role,\" said Stacy Sandler, principal, Deloitte Consulting LLP. \"By acting in the best interest of plan participants, plan sponsors are offering holistic tactics to support participant financial wellness and focusing on simplifying the plan offerings. A critical component of that is making sure sponsors better educate employees on options and help them to fully utilize the financial tools and resources available to them.\"  Financial Wellness Takes Center Stage  Plan sponsors have responded to an increased focus on their fiduciary role and financial wellness concerns by taking behavioral finance approaches and leveraging tailored technological solutions at their disposal. This is in line with findings from Deloitte\\'s survey, which indicates that 66 percent of employers want providers to focus on enhanced plan sponsor websites and tools that will help them identify where to concentrate their education efforts.  Plan sponsors have been concentrating on getting the right messages to the right audiences in the right way. The most popular form of communication is demographic targeting, with 65 percent of employers using it, compared to 54 percent using activity-based and 45 percent using behavior-based targeting. Financial analytics are also playing an increasingly important role in broader financial wellness and through integration with defined contribution plan offerings. In fact, 65 percent of those surveyed have cited the introduction or enhancement of \"auto-pilot\" solutions, such as auto-enrollment, step-up features and managed accounts, bringing automatic enrollment to the third most cited reason for participation in this year\\'s survey. Additionally, as organizations seek to become digital, the availability of mobile transactions for managing defined contribution accounts has tripled since 2013.

       " 'Business Royal Mail staff set to strike over pensions blow RoyalMail workers are on the verge of an historic strike in a huge row over pensions that threatens to jeopardise attempts to modernise the company.  The Communication Workers Union was on Tuesday poised to announce that 110,000 members had voted for industrial action over Christmas - the first since the Royal Mail was privatised four years ago.  Union watchers see the case as the first major test of the Government\\'s controversial Trade Union Act, which requires strike ballots to have a 50% turnout.  The union was expected to say that it had passed this milestone easily as it fights plans to ditch postal workers valuable final salary pension schemes.  An analysis of the CWU\\'s own finances however suggests it might struggle to fund a strike for very long.  The latest report and account show it ran up a deficit last year of £5.4 million as expenses topped income. The CWU general fund is also £14.5 million in the red.  The accounts reveal that the CWU gave £500,000 to the Labour Party, which some in the delivery sector think ironic since the party hasn\\'t used Royal Mail for several years, preferring Whistle for its own deliveries.  The union accuses the Royal Mail of a \"relentless\" programme of cost-cutting to maximise profits.  The union accused the company of \"unilaterally\" closing its defined benefit, or final salary, pension scheme, with new entrants going into an \"inferior\" scheme which will leave them in \"pensioner poverty\".  CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: \"Postal workers are under relentless pressure to work faster, harder and cheaper. This has nothing to do with driving growth and innovation, it\\'s all about the tired old thinking of privatisation and asset-stripping.\"  A Royal Mail spokesman said: \"There are no grounds for industrial action. There is a very good deal on the table. Industrial action - or the threat of it - undermines the trust of our customers. We remain committed to reaching a negotiated agreement with the CWU on pay and pensions, and other issues we have been discussing.\"  Royal Mail shares were today steady at 383p. They hit 600p in early 2014.  Royal Mail argues it is operating in the most competitive delivery market in the world, with 16 major competitors including Amazon, which now does one in every ten parcel delivery.  Letter volumes have declined 40% in the last 10 years as people increasingly prefer email. Royal Mail says it has spent £1.5 billion on upgrading its IT systems to cope with the new world of technology.  After one year in the job postmen and women earn £22,764 per year, more than a teacher or nurse.  Royal Mail says under its new proposed scheme, someone aged 50, earning £25,000 per year and retiring at 65 would retire on an annual pension of £12,300 and a tax-free lump sum of £81,800. It says this compares favourably with most other retirement deals.',\n",
       " 'Financial Adviser: Homeowners release 50% more equity from property UK homeowners released 50 per cent more equity from their properties over the past three months, according to Responsible Equity Release.  The 49.6 per cent increase on the previous quarter (March to May) came as homeowners looked to use their properties to boost pension income and pay off mortgages, the provider said.  An average of more than £100,000-worth of equity per plan was released over the past three months, with an average of £74,116 released immediately and an average additional borrowing facility of £35,514 to draw from as and when the money is needed.  The number of UK homeowners releasing equity from their homes climbed by 28.4 per cent quarter-on-quarter and 86.6 per cent on the same quarter in 2016.  Homeowners in the north-west released more than double (102.3 per cent) the amount of equity in August compared to July, while those in the east of England released 55.3 per cent more.  London saw a 17.2 per cent drop in the total amount of equity released by homeowners in August compared with July, with an average amount of £174,489 last month.  The fall was probably due to the capital\\'s cooling property market, which has performed worse than almost any other regional market in the UK over the past few months.  Steve Wilkie, managing director of Responsible Equity Release, said: \"The Bank of England has indicated that an interest rate rise is on the horizon, but a small increase in the base rate is unlikely to help Britain\\'s retirees who have suffered more than most during the past eight years of record low rates.  \"Whether rates will rise in the near future is anyone\\'s guess, and many people have decided there\\'s no point in waiting for that day. Instead, they have taken matters into their own hands and are using their one major asset, their property, to boost flagging income.\"  Tracey Lucas, equity release adviser at Suffolk-based Needham Mortgage Centre, said she thought the current equity release boom was just the tip of the iceberg.  She said: \"The people who are coming up to retirement, their pension planning is not adequate, and there will be more and more people in that situation.  \"Even the government is saying people should be accessing wealth in their property.  \"The newer contracts are more flexible and a lot more suited to a life situation than they used to be.  \"Also, there are people coming to the end of interest-only mortgages and who don\\'t want to move house, people finding it hard to make ends meet on a state pension, people who want to give a gift to their families and those who just want to spend the money.  \"People\\'s attitudes are slowly changing - there is no stigma attached to it now.

       " 'Colorado brokerage emphasizes creative microbranding for its agents; LIV Sotheby\\'s International Realty launches agent film series DENVER, Sept. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Colorado real estate firm, LIV Sotheby\\'s International Realty, has announced the completion of its first round of agent films, a series of high-quality, short films meant to create a personal connection between agents and clients. Further diversifying the way the public sees real estate agents, the short films provide a window into an agent\\'s life and personality, enabling potential home buyers and sellers to \"meet\" the agents and decide which agent is the perfect match to meet their real estate needs.  \"Our business is all about our people,\" said LIV Sotheby\\'s International Realty president, Scott Webber. \"Today, information about real estate is available at our fingertips, but for us, human interaction is at the forefront of thought for LIV Sotheby\\'s International Realty. Every home has a story and so do our agents. To us, buying or selling a home requires human interaction and these films embody that sentiment.\"  LIV SIR partnered with Evoker, Inc., a Chicago-based multimedia branding agency, to create the agent films. The studio-quality films are generally less than two minutes and eliminate the corporate, mass-produced structure of a standard biography video, allowing brokers to tell their personal story, whether it entails mountain biking in the Colorado Rockies, interacting with family and friends, or playing a round of golf. There is no script, no storyboard, and no two films are ever the same.  Each agent film is created with a cinematic approach. Evoker producers meet with brokers during two consultation visits prior to filming, helping to streamline the production process, which usually takes about one day. Not only is the personal story of each agent captured, but additional footage, including the areas the broker services, is artistically weaved into the films, creating powerful, emotion-evoking results.  \"We try to diversify the way the public sees agents,\" said Webber. \"LIV Sotheby\\'s International Realty is the leading luxury real estate firm in the Colorado and Denver property market. We have a very interesting group of Colorado luxury real estate experts, and we are more than pleased with the results of the films.\"  Out of LIV SIR\\'s 350+ agents, 20 agents signed up for the first round of the lifestyle-inspired films, with a \\'Red Carpet\\' film premiere event to debut the films taking place in August, in Denver.

       " 'US Annuity Sales Rise in Q2, But Still Down Nearly 10% from 2016 Non-qualified sales buoyed variable annuity market, IRI reports.  The Insured Retirement Institute (IRI), a financial services trade association, reported that the US annuity industry totaled $50.4 billion in sales for the second quarter, up 2.4% from $49.2 billion the previous quarter, but down 9.8% from $55.9 billion in the same period last year.  Fixed annuity sales during the second quarter rose 3.1% to $26.7 billion from the $25.9 billion reported in the first quarter, but were down 9.5% from $29.5 billion in sales for the second quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, variable annuity total sales increased 1.7% to $23.7 billion in the second quarter from $23.3 billion in the previous quarter, but fell 10.2% from sales of $26.4 billion in the second quarter of 2016. The figures from the IRI are based on data reported by Beacon Research and Morningstar, Inc.  It is \"encouraging to see growth in industry-wide sales of annuities,\" said Cathy Weatherford, president and CEO of IRI, in a statement. \"IRI believes annuity sales will continue to increase as thousands of Americans enter retirement each day.\"  According to Beacon Research, the quarterly increase in total fixed annuity sales was led by sales of fixed indexed products. Fixed indexed annuity sales climbed 10% to $14.9 billion from $13.6 billion in the first quarter, although sales were down 7.1% from the second quarter of 2016, when $16.1 billion in sales were reported. Overall fixed annuity sales also increased 11% from the previous quarter to $2.8 billion on strong sales of income annuities.  Book value and market value adjusted annuities had combined sales of $9 billion, which was down 7.7% from $9.8 billion during the first quarter, and 8.9% below sales of $9.9 billion for the year-ago quarter. For the entire fixed annuity market, there were approximately $15.1 billion in qualified sales, and $11.6 billion in non-qualified sales during the second quarter.  Variable annuity net assets increased 1.8% to $1.98 trillion during the second quarter, which was 5.1% higher than the same period last year, as positive market performance continued to overcome the impact of lower sales and negative net flows, according to Morningstar. Net flows in variable annuities were negative $14.8 billion in the second quarter.  Within the variable annuity market, there were $15.3 billion in qualified sales and $8.4 billion in non-qualified sales during Q2. Qualified sales dropped 1.8% from Q1 sales of $15.6 billion, while sales of non-qualified variable annuities gained 8.6% from Q1 sales of $7.7 billion.  \"While total variable annuity sales rose slightly, the largest increases were in non-qualified sales,\" said John McCarthy, senior product manager at Morningstar. \"We are also seeing growth in newer investment-oriented products such as structured annuities.\"',\n",
       " \"IRS Relaxes Loan, Hardship Rules for Hurricane Irma Victims The PBGC and DOL also are providing relief similar to that provided by Hurricane Harvey victims.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announced that 401(k)s and similar employer-sponsored retirement plans can make loans and hardship distributions to victims of Hurricane Irma and members of their families. This is similar to relief provided last month to victims of Hurricane Harvey.  Participants in 401(k) plans, employees of public schools and tax-exempt organizations with 403(b) tax-sheltered annuities, as well as state and local government employees with 457(b) deferred-compensation plans may be eligible to take advantage of these streamlined loan procedures and liberalized hardship distribution rules. Though IRA participants are barred from taking out loans, they may be eligible to receive distributions under liberalized procedures.  Retirement plans can provide this relief to employees and certain members of their families who live or work in disaster areas affected by Hurricane Irma and designated for individual assistance by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). For a complete list of eligible localities, visit https://www.fema.gov/disasters. To qualify for this relief, hardship withdrawals must be made by January 31, 2018.  The IRS is also relaxing procedural and administrative rules that normally apply to retirement plan loans and hardship distributions. As a result, eligible retirement plan participants will be able to access their money more quickly with a minimum of red tape. In addition, the six-month ban on 401(k) and 403(b) contributions that normally affects employees who take hardship distributions will not apply.  This broad-based relief means that a retirement plan can allow a victim of Hurricane Irma to take a hardship distribution or borrow up to the specified statutory limits from the victim's retirement plan. It also means that a person who lives outside the disaster area can take out a retirement plan loan or hardship distribution and use it to assist a son, daughter, parent, grandparent or other dependent who lived or worked in the disaster area.  Plans will be allowed to make loans or hardship distributions before the plan is formally amended to provide for such features. In addition, the plan can ignore the reasons that normally apply to hardship distributions, thus allowing them, for example, to be used for food and shelter. If a plan requires certain documentation before a distribution is made, the plan can relax this requirement as described in Announcement 2017-13.  The IRS emphasized that the tax treatment of loans and distributions remains unchanged. Ordinarily, retirement plan loan proceeds are tax-free if they are repaid over a period of five years or less.\\xa0 Under current law, hardship distributions are generally taxable and subject to a 10% early-withdrawal tax.

Gradifi\\'s new clients include LABUR, Sebak and Monner Associates, Michael Jordan Appraisals Inc., Everest Global Services Inc., and NoTime2Chill. These companies join progressive workplaces currently offering the SLP Plan, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Peloton and Penguin Random House.  Gradifi has agreements with more than 170 companies across the U.S. for its innovative student loan repayment program. In the past two months, 40 companies have agreed to offer Gradifi\\'s SLP plan, which enables employers to make a monthly contribution to pay down an employee\\'s debt.  For an employee with a loan balance of $26,500 - the median amount borrowed for a bachelor\\'s degree - a $100 per month employer contribution for a loan at 4% over 10 years would save over $10,000 in principal and interest. The employer contribution would result in a 30% reduction in total payments, and the loan would be paid off three years faster.  Seth Burr, co-founder and COO of Boston-based LABUR, LLC., said, \"For us, offering this plan to our employees was a no-brainer. If we have associates who are distracted by thoughts of things like how they are going to pay off their student loan debt, they are less focused and less likely to be as successful as they could be if they didn\\'t have the stress of those outside thoughts. We established LABUR as a way to influence how other people achieve success. This is a tool to help us do that.\"  Tim DeMello, founder and CEO of Gradifi, said, \"A growing number of people with student loan debt are putting off major life decisions. Employers who offer a student loan repayment benefit not only help their employees, but also gain a clear competitive advantage in recruiting highly skilled workers burdened by student loan debt.\" About Gradifi Gradifi is a best-in-class, student loan repayment solution addressing the nation\\'s student loan problem. Gradifi helps organizations attract and retain talent by enabling employers to make direct contributions to their employees\\' student loans and accelerate the pay-off of the debt. A wholly owned subsidiary of First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), Boston-based Gradifi offers the SLP Plan(TM) (Student Loan Paydown) benefit to employers of all sizes and is endorsed by the American Bankers Association through its Corporation for American Banking subsidiary.

       " 'Money GRAND DESIGN Savvy couple quoted £1million to build dream new home save £400,000 by doing it themselves The striking house coated in in zinc panelling features a bright yellow steel staircase and ultra-modern kitchen and bathroom  A SAVVY couple who were quoted £1million to build their new house saved £400,000 by designing it themselves.  The ultra-modern property was built on a plot of land in Haringey, north London, which they bought for £750,000.  It was previously the site of a derelict guardhouse which had remained untouched for 30 years.  Penny Talelli and Mark Edwards, both neurologists, decided to work together on creating their dream pad rather than pay out the seven-figure sum.  The creative pair, who have two children, opted for a statement \"cube\" design, coated in zinc panelling, which combined Penny\\'s passion for modern art and Mark\\'s love of more traditional architecture.  The house features a funky bright yellow steel staircase - Penny\\'s pride and joy - and an ultra contemporary kitchen with a tribute to 19th century designs with chunky dark wood, distressed cabinets.  The spacious living area boasts large windows overlooking the garden and patio doors, which let in plenty of natural light.  The furnishings are predominantly neutral, natural colours, with leather, marble and wrought iron giving the home cutting edge appeal.  Their spacious bathroom continues the dark wood theme and features his and hers sinks as well as eye-catching blue tiles on the wall behind the bath.  The couple\\'s stunning home features on tonight\\'s (Wednesday) episode of Grand Designs on Channel 4.  Penny explains: \"I love modern architecture. You can express yourself via the building.  \"You get yourself a plot and say, \\'I\\'m going to build a house that\\'s me.\\'\"  Mark admitted that he\\'d fallen in love with the original guardhouse on the plot and the duo initially tried to build the new property around it, but the foundations were too weak, meaning that it had to be demolished.  However, Mark insisted that they saved the windows from the old building, which cost £3,000 to restore - double the cost of replacement windows.  Due to the home\\'s unusual shape, the foundations needed 42 pillars, which came with a £150,000 bill.  The project took two-and-a-half years to complete, but the couple say they are delighted with their new house.  Mark said: \"It shows you what is possible, I think, by doing it yourself.  \"We\\'ve invested so much time and thought into all the different bits in it that when you see them, it does something good for you inside.  \"It has an internal consistency because it\\'s the story of us, the story of both of us, somehow it\\'s all in here.\"  Last year we told how a couple splashed £175,000 converting a simple 1960s bungalow into an incredible modern home - but the neighbours HATE it.  figcaptionInside incredible home transformed into giant playground on Grand Designs',\n",
       " 'DOL Officially Proposes 18-Month Extension Of Fiduciary Rule Exemptions\\' Transition Period On Thursday, August 31, 2017, the Department of Labor (DOL) published its proposal1\\xa0to extend the \"Transition Period\"2 for the Best Interest Contract (BIC) Exemption3 and Principal Transaction Exemption4 from its currently scheduled end date of January 1, 2018 until July 1, 2019. The proposal would also delay the applicability date of certain amendments to Prohibited Transaction Exemption (PTE) 84-24 for the same period. No further changes to the Transition Period were proposed. If the proposal is finalized, fiduciaries relying on the BIC Exemption may continue to comply with the current \"Impartial Conduct Standards\" (provide prudent advice that is in retirement investors\\' best interest, charge no more than reasonable compensation, and avoid misleading statements) and avoid adherence with the BIC Exemption\\'s more onerous requirements through at least July 1, 2019.  In proposing the delay, DOL cited its ongoing reexamination of the Fiduciary Rule5 and related PTEs pursuant to President Trump\\'s memorandum on February 3, 2017, as well as its desire to look for alternatives to the requirements in those exemptions. DOL stated that in the near future it might propose a new and more streamlined class exemption based on recent innovations in the financial services industry, such as the creation of \"clean shares.\"6  DOL is also seeking comment on whether other approaches to the delay would be more appropriate, in particular, the relative benefits or harms of three possible approaches: (1) a \"time-certain\" delay, such as the currently proposed 18 months, (2) a delay that ends at a specific time period after the occurrence of a defined event (such as the conclusion of DOL\\'s presidentially mandated review); or (3) a tiered approach that extends the Transition Period until the earlier or later of (a) a date certain or (b) the end of a period following the occurrence of a defined event.

       " \"Money A broken car and no cash Nicole Helps  Hi Nicole, I am a single woman aged 53 and due to some health issues, I earn very little as a cleaner working two days a week. I make enough to live on but only have $60 spare dollars each week. I'm lucky - my parents left me their house when they died so I have no accommodation issues or costs. The problem is I have virtually nothing in savings - and the Holy Sh*t fund you talk about is non-existent. I'm writing to you because the mechanic tells me my car is about to need a new gearbox and it's going to cost $1000 for a second-hand one. I just don't know what to do. I need it to get to work. - Debra, Wollongong  That's a distressing situation Debra - but by no means one without hope. You have your home and you have your $60 spare a week.  Without knowing the details of your income, you also sound like you might be eligible for an interest-free loan from an amazing not-for-profit called Good Shepherd Microfinance. In fact the staff tell me 380,000 Australians could access their loans in situations such as yours, but only 8 per cent of those who are eligible actually have.  Even so, last year 22,400 people were lent some $20 million through the No-Interest Loan Scheme (NILS). To be eligible, you must earn less than $45,000 after tax and hold a Health Care Card or pension card.  NILS will cover an essential good or service (say a new fridge or medical procedure) or pay an essential bill (a car repair) of up to $1200 and you are able to repay the debt at a manageable rate over the next 12 to 18 months.  You get the loans through more than 600 community organisations around Australia... the closest to you might be the Bulli Community Centre or Port Kembla Community Centre.  If your car ultimately lets you down, there may also be the option to access the StepUp program, which is offered by Good Shepherd in conjunction with NAB. These loans are for amounts of up to $3000 and attract an interest rate of 5.99 per cent. Again with this one you need a Health Care Card/pension card (or be in receipt of Family Tax Benefit A) to qualify. Loans are repaid over three years.  Don't beat yourself up about your situation Debra... it sounds as though you are really good with money - possibly better than a lot of people who have more of it! And one in three women have no Holy Sh*t fund, according to research by finder.com.  But as soon as you pay back your NILS debt, start putting that spare $60 into a high-interest bank account so you have the capacity to deal with it next time you need it.  nicolehelps@fairfaxmedia.com.au\",\n",
       " 'Financial Adviser: PensionBee launches non-advised drawdown service PensionBee, the fintech pension provider, has launched a drawdown service for people who do not have an adviser to consolidate and draw an income from their retirement nest eggs.  The service will be available to customers shortly before they turn 55, and allows them to withdraw their 25 per cent tax-free lump sum or another amount.  PensionBee\\'s objective is to give customers full transparency over their pension and demonstrate how easy it is to draw down, should they wish to.  The drawdown service also automatically calculates the amount of tax payable on withdrawals.  Other features include interactive risk warnings that appear at the right moment in time and name-bank account validation to protect customers, the fintech pension provider said.  Over the longer-term, the product will function like a bank account, with savers easily drawing down lump sums as the need arises.  The service works alongside PensionBee\\'s core service, which allows savers to combine multiple pots into one online pension account.  Romi Savova, chief executive at PensionBee, has become \"increasingly concerned that some savers are simply drawing down their pensions, and putting them into their bank account so that they feel the money is theirs\".  She said: \"This can result in an overpayment of tax, which is easily avoided by simply giving customers more visibility over their money.  \"We think savers are more likely to focus on better long-term outcomes if they feel control over their pensions.\"  Non-advised drawdowns\\' are one of the key concern areas of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  In a paper published in July, it noted that consumers who access their pots early without taking advice typically follow the \\'path of least resistance\\', accepting drawdown from their current pension provider without shopping around.  The FCA\\'s retirement outcomes review also revealed that savers are overwhelmingly more likely to stay with their existing provider if they are not advised.  In the meantime, the Association of British Insurers is working on a proposal for an income drawdown comparison tool.  It would allow consumers going into drawdown on a non-advised basis to compare products on the market.  Fiona Tait, technical director of Intelligent Pensions, said that \"it has been obvious since the introduction of pension freedoms that new models are required to help mass market consumers\".  She said: \"Consolidating pensions in one place can certainly make it easier for individuals to track their pensions savings, and it is very positive that the issue of withdrawing money simply because they can is being addressed.\"  However, Ms Tait has \"strong concerns about the concept of a pensions bank account\", as suggested by PensionBee with its new tool.  \"The primary purpose of pension plans is to provide an income in retirement rather than ad hoc lump sums, and withdrawals should always be considered in the context of sustainability. Taking income without financial advice could lead to more people running out of money too soon,\" she said.  maria.espadinha@ft.com',\n",
       " 'News New York Cracks Down on Student Loan Fraud, Abuse Proclaiming that he \"won\\'t allow a generation of New Yorkers to get victimized by the very system that was created to help them get ahead, \" New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman today announced an aggressive crackdown on fraud and abuse in the student loan industry.  The announcement follows a proposed settlement that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and several state attorneys general, including Schneiderman, reached last week with Aequitas Capital Management, a student loan company that saddled students of the now-bankrupt Corinthian Colleges chain with loans they couldn\\'t afford. (The proposed settlement requires the approval of a U.S. District Court in Oregon.)  (Related: CFPB Seeks $183M From Lender Over Corinthian College Loan Scheme)  The proposed settlement would provide $183.3 million in loan forgiveness and reduction to 41,000 students.  (Related: How Student Loan Companies Are Causing More Defaults)  Schneiderman\\'s office also announced last week that over 800 students of the for-profit DeVry University (now renamed Adtalem Global Education with the ticker symbol ATGE) would share in a $2.25 million settlement for deceptive ads that exaggerated the employment success of the school\\'s graduates. (That settlement was originally reached in January.)  In his announcement today, Schneiderman laid out a three-pronged attack his office will pursue against fraud and abuse in the student loan industry:  1. Pressing \"full speed\" ahead with cracking down on \"predatory for-profit colleges and the loan servicers who enable them\" and continuing to investigate potential abuses in student debt collection.  2. An inquiry it recently opened into the collection practices of the National Collegiate Student Loan Trust, which holds over 800,000 private student loans and is allegedly pursuing cases against students it says have fallen behind on their payments.  \"We\\'re going to find out whether New York students have been targeted and defrauded,\" said Schneiderman in today\\'s announcement.  3. Opposing the federal government\\'s delay in implementing a rule that would make it easier for defrauded student loan borrowers to pursue debt forgiveness. He joined 18 other attorneys general in a lawsuit suit against Education Secretary Betsy DeVos opposing the delay.  \"DeVos decided it was more important to protect predatory colleges from lawsuits ? and called it a \\'regulatory reset,\\'\" writes Schneiderman.  He concludes his statement noting that \"when a student loan company breaks the law and misleads thousands of students into taking on loans they can\\'t afford, that company should be held accountable.\"  New York student loan borrowers own on average $30,000, according to Schneiderman. Nationally more than 40% of student loan borrowers owe $20,000 or more, double the percentage of 15 years ago, according to the CFPB.  --- Related on Thinkadvisor:  * How Student Loan Companies Are Causing More Defaults  * Lawmakers Push Bill Allowing Student Debt to Be Discharged in Bankruptcy  * A Portrait of the Student Loan Borrower: Older, Deeper in Debt, More Likely Delinquent  * The Economic Costs of Swelling Student Loan Debt',\n",
       " \"Reform Of Law Surrounding Wills: From The Victorian-Era To The Digital-Era? It is estimated that approximately 40% of people over 18 die without making a Will. To try and address this alarming statistic the Law Commission has this month launched a consultation proposing an overhaul of the current law on Wills.  Key provisions governing the validity of a Will can still be found in the Wills Act 1837. The Law Commissioner, Professor Nick Hopkins, posits that these Victorian-era formalities are 'out of step' with the modern world and that they could actually be putting people off preparing a Will.  The Law Commission proposals, therefore, include updating the procedure for preparing a Will to make it compatible with the digital age. Under the new proposals it is envisaged that people would be able to use text messages, voicemails and other electronic forms to record their wills. It would then be up to the discretion of county and high court judges to validate the will as an accurate summary of the person's wishes. If a person on their deathbed has a change of heart then this could also be recorded and validated, overruling an existing valid will.  Under the present law, a Will must be written and signed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses who must also sign the Will in order for it to be valid. Whilst, this procedure might seem antiquated to some, relaxing these formal rules could have worrying implications and it presents significant challenges. For instance, it is feared that after the death of the testator a Will may be more easily contested by dissatisfied relatives and there are also concerns surrounding the protection of vulnerable testators and ensuring they are able to prepare their Wills without pressure or coercion.  The Law Commission's other proposals include updating the test for whether an individual has the requisite mental capacity to make a Will to take into account the modern medical understanding of conditions such as Dementia. The Commission is also consulting on whether the age at which people can make a will should be lowered from 18 to 16 years old.  Whilst the proposals suggest that a significant departure from the current legal framework may be imminent, responses to the Consultation will provide the Law Commission with invaluable insight into both the advantages but also the hurdles and repercussions of such changes. The consultation period runs until 10 November 2017 and professionals, relevant organisations and the general public are invited to provide the Law Commission with feedback on the proposals.

       " 'Money Unpaid internships damage long-term graduate pay prospects Study shows working for free leads to salary disadvantage  Almost every graduate taking an unpaid internship can expect to be worse off three years later than if they had gone straight into work.  That is the shock finding of the first survey of its kind of the career trajectories of tens of thousands of students over a six-year period.  The study, conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, reveals that, three-and-a-half years after graduating, former interns face a salary penalty of approximately £3,500, compared with those who went straight into paid work, and £1,500 compared with those who went into further study. Interns who were privately schooled or had parents in professional occupations also found themselves worse off, albeit by not as much.  On average they were earning £2,000 less than their counterparts. Those from more disadvantaged backgrounds were more than £4,000 worse off than their counterparts who went straight into work. The study confirmed that graduates from advantaged backgrounds were more likely to find the sought-after internships. Meanwhile, those from disadvantaged backgrounds were often compelled to take unpaid work because of limited job offers.  Dr Angus Holford, who carried out the study, said it showed that many graduates who took internships would end up disappointed if they thought it would put them on the path to success in a favoured career.  \"I expect some people will find an internship that enables them to do the job they really want to do and that will have the big labour-market return but, on average, an internship you take won\\'t lead directly to a job in the profession you really wanted or the profession you did the internship in.\"  The study also found that those who took internships were less likely to go on to professional or managerial roles or be satisfied with their career compared with those who had gone straight into work.  Compared with those who went onto further study, an internship reduced the probability of a graduate working in a professional or managerial role, or being very satisfied with their career, by 15 and 8.8 percentage points respectively.  Holford said that one reason for the earning disparity could be that graduates who took an internship were delaying the start of their careers which could often see them end up in entirely different occupations from the ones in which they did their work placements.  More than a third of graduates who took an internship - 38% - did so as an experiment to see if they would like the type of work it involved.  \"If you are not able to find a job straight away, you\\'ve missed the graduate intake, that boat has sailed and you are left behind. If you take a while to get promoted you might be a little bit behind. Or you might get side-tracked into a different career trajectory.\"',\n",

In a letter sent by U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., to 13 different banks including Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, TD Bank, PNC Bank and Ocean Bank, institutions are asked to identify how much they depend on overdraft fees for revenue.  \"I\\'m concerned that too many of our nation\\'s banks are increasingly driven to accumulate these [overdraft] fees, rather than pursue a business model that serves their communities, and are adopting certain practices to drive participation in so-called \\'overdraft protection\\' programs,\" the letter states.

Home sales are down 14.1 per cent from the record level set in March.  \"Changes to Ontario housing policy made in late April have clearly prompted many homebuyers in the Greater Golden Horseshoe region to take a step back and assess how the housing market absorbs the changes,\" CREA chief economist Gregory Klump said in a statement.  \"The recent increase in interest rates could reinforce a lack of urgency to purchase or, alternatively, move some buyers off the sidelines before their pre-approved mortgage rate expires. In the meantime, some move-up buyers who previously purchased a home before first selling may become more motivated to reduce their asking price rather than carry two mortgages.\"  Sales were down from the previous month in 70 per cent of all local markets measured by CREA, including the Lower Mainland in B.C., Montreal and Quebec City.  The Ontario government moved earlier this year to cool the Toronto real estate market, bringing in more than a dozen measures including a 15 per cent tax on foreign buyers. Since then, sales in Canada\\'s largest city have slowed.  Separately, mortgage interest rates have started to rise in recent days. That came after the Bank of Canada raised its key interest rate last week by 25 basis points to 0.75 per cent, a move that prompted the big banks to increase their prime rates. Rates for new fixed-rate mortgages also ticked up in anticipation of the central bank rate hike.  Compared with a year ago, national home sales in June were down 11.4 per cent.  TD Bank economist Diana Petramala said that after growing this year, home prices are expected to fall next year.  \"Much of that weakness will be concentrated in markets in Ontario and B.C., where households are particularly sensitive to higher mortgage rates given the stretched affordability,\" Petramala wrote in a note to clients.  \"Elsewhere in the country, the improving economic conditions should help offset some of the impact of gradual interest rate hikes, with home prices and sales expected to trend higher.\"  The national average price for a home sold in June was $504,458, up 0.4 per cent from a year ago. Excluding Greater Vancouver and Greater Toronto, the national average price was $394,660, up 5.8 per cent.  The aggregate composite Multiple Listing Service home price index for June was up 15.8 per cent compared with a year ago.',\n",
       " 'Money \\'eBay fraudster stole £1,023 and my gold coins but PayPal won\\'t refund me\\' I received payment via PayPal from a buyer of two gold coins I had sold on eBay. Shortly after, I received a message from the buyer\\'s official eBay account asking me to send the coins to a different address.  I duly sent the recorded delivery package as requested.  According to Royal Mail tracking, it arrived the next day.  Two days later, after the coins had been signed for, I received an email from PayPal stating that the buyer\\'s account had been hacked and the money I had received was an unauthorised payment.  Once I explained that there had been a change of address, PayPal promptly refunded my money back to the buyer from my account. So I have lost the money and the gold coins.  eBay has now refunded its commission to me and PayPal has paid back half of what I lost but I am still out of pocket to the tune of £1,023.  Can you get this back for me?  JJ, Warwickshire  Initially I approached eBay, which said that because you had sent the items to a different address there was nothing more it could do.  It said it is important for sellers to send items to the address provided in their buyer\\'s \"View Order Details\".  It said: \"Sending the item to another address is likely to mean the item isn\\'t covered by seller protection.\"  With PayPal, as usual there were promptings from me, calls not returned and wrong responses that I had to correct.  My involvement did lead to PayPal issuing you with a full refund \"as a goodwill gesture\", so the remaining £1,023 has been reimbursed.  Its response had been in a similar vein to eBay\\'s, with it saying: \"Our Seller Protection policy can cover the cost of unauthorised payments, if the seller can provide us with proof of postage and delivery to the buyer\\'s address as specified in the transaction confirmation. In Mr J\\'s case he sent his goods to a different address.\"  I had checked PayPal\\'s seller protection and thought that gold anyway was not eligible. PayPal had not picked up on this and only when I queried this came back saying that PayPal\\'s seller protection does not indeed cover payments made in respect of gold in any physical form.  Previously it admitted it had been distracted by the address issue.  The item had been delivered to a flat above a taxi service. I called the taxi service, which said the flats were rented independently.  I suggested that, armed with the crime number you acquired when you reported this matter to Action Fraud, the UK\\'s national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre, (0300 123 2040 and actionfraud.police.uk), you should urge the local police to pay a visit.

       " 'Sport Draw up your will in a text message Law Commission says \\'outdated\\' system of inheritance must catch up with digital age  PEOPLE will be able to use voicemail and text messages to make their wills under a radical overhaul of inheritance laws proposed by the Government\\'s legal advisers.  The Law Commission has branded the legacy system \"outdated\" and said it must keep up with the digital age.  Under laws which date back to 1839, wills need to be written and signed by the testator as well as two witnesses in order to be valid. The commission suggests those rules are unclear.  It has called for the law to be relaxed to allow notes, emails and voicemail messages to be used in place of a written will. Under its proposals, new powers would allow county and high court judges to decide \"on the balance of probabilities\" whether a recording or note is an accurate summary of a person\\'s wishes. Deathbed changes of heart could be recorded and used to overrule an existing valid will.  The Commission has admitted that the proposals could add to family arguments. It said: \"A person who is seriously ill in hospital may have more immediate access to a tablet or smartphone than to a pen and paper, and may be more able to speak than to write. On the other hand, the potential recognition of electronic documents could provide a treasure trove for dissatisfied relatives.  \"They may be tempted to sift through a huge number of texts, emails and other records in order to find one that could be put forward as a will on the basis of a dispensing power.\"  The powers already exist in Australia, Canada, South Africa and several American states.  Experts urged caution amid concerns older people could be pressured into last-minute changes. Caroline Abraham, Age UK charity director, said: \"Whilst we welcome this public consultation, any proposed changes must not create further barriers for people who wish to plan ahead, and ensure that older people are able to make their own decisions wherever possible, free from pressure and coercion.\"  Elizabeth Neale, partner in the private wealth team at the law firm Bircham Dyson Bell, said that weakening the rules could have \"worrying\" implications for vulnerable people and there could be \"pressure on people to write something down or make a voicemail\".  Prof Nick Hopkins, a member of the Law Commission, said: \"Any new law would protect vulnerable testators against possible undue influence, and certainly if there was any suggestion that that had been exercised, the court isn\\'t going to use the dispensing power. But this is a consultation, so if anyone has those concerns, they should let us know.\"  The proposals also suggest changing the law about mental capacity to make it easier to assess whether someone with dementia is able to make a will and lowering the age someone can make a will from 18 to 16.  The consultation, which launches today, will run until Nov 10.',\n",
       " 'Financial Post Investing Pension fund moves into riskier investments; Venture Capital Frustrated by poor returns, OPTrust chief executive Hugh O\\'Reilly is moving into riskier investments as contributors to the retirement fund age.  \"We can\\'t just match cash flows, we have to take risks,\" O\\'Reilly, whose company oversees $19.2 billion of investments for Ontario government workers, said in an interview. \"We don\\'t want to increase contributions or reduce future benefit accruals where the active members will bear the whole risk.\"  OPTrust is starting a $300-million venture-capital portfolio and is considering derivatives linked to insurance risk, O\\'Reilly said. The firm has allocated 1.5 per cent to these riskier assets and three per cent in hedge funds, though the latter is under review, O\\'Reilly said without elaborating. The fund more than doubled assets in hedge funds in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to the 2016 annual report.  \"We want to allocate relatively small amounts of capital into new and different investment areas,\" O\\'Reilly said. OPTrust will then \"see if they\\'re viable, see if they make sense, see if we can incubate them and bring them back and put them where they best belong on the investment team.\"  OPTrust, which manages pension assets for almost 90,000 former and current members of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, generated a return on investment of six per cent for last year. That was down from eight per cent in 2015 and was less than half the 2016 return of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country\\'s largest pension plan.  \"Investment returns are unpredictable and can result in a wide range on any one-year basis,\" O\\'Reilly said. \"We know that our portfolio can deliver on our pension sustainability objectives over the long run.\"  O\\'Reilly declined to say what OPTrust targets in returns, saying it is focused more on the amount of risk exposure it can tolerate.  The new venture-capital fund, known as the Incubation Portfolio, will target latestage startups that are mostly already profitable, O\\'Reilly said. Another large Canadian pension fund and a venturecapital firm, which he declined to name because the details are still being worked out, will help fund and guide some of the investments, he said. \"Venture capital is where the future is in terms of Canada, understanding risk and disruption,\" O\\'Reilly said. \"We\\'re going to get active in this area.\"  The strategy tweak comes as the number of workers that support the Torontobased fund is falling. Between 2007 and 2016, its retirees rose 60 per cent to more than 36,000, while its active members fell 8.7 per cent to almost 44,000, according to the pension fund.  The pension will keep outside management for most of its equity trading, some of it by RBC\\'s PH&N Investment Services and Beutel, Goodman & Co., because of attractive pricing and the ability to learn from industry experts, O\\'Reilly said.',\n",
       " 'Opinion High State Debts Beget Desperate Measures; If a thrifty, sensible legislator refuses a pension boost, another will displace him or her at the next election. Regarding your editorial \"Blue State Budget Breakdowns\" (July 5): It\\'s very easy to assail legislators when they run up huge pension bills and other expenses, but whether enacted by Democrats or Republicans those escalating expenses are a structural, inevitable feature of democracy. If a thrifty, sensible legislator refuses a pension boost, another will displace him or her at the next election. It is unreasonable for the Journal or anyone else to expect legislators to do good if they have to wreck their careers doing so. What we need is a way to relieve legislators from the personal blame for making unpopular but sensible financial choices.  One way to do this is to create an automatic feedback mechanism that ties government salaries and pension plans to reliable financial or other standard-of-living metrics such as the GDP, or a GDP for a given state or GDP per capita in any given state or city. If the metric rises or falls, pension plans and salaries would correspondingly rise and fall. That way legislators would be motivated to do everything possible to improve the standard of living or GDP per capita, rather than continually risk bankruptcy to stay in office.  John Barchilon  Los Angeles  In recent years, a number of states have failed to meet their legal, contractual and moral obligations to contribute to pension funds for their workers. In some cases, as in New Jersey, this was done to offset revenue lost due to massive tax cuts for the wealthy. The resulting \"crisis\" has been the predictable result.  Criticizing union leaders for fighting for the pension benefits their members have earned is \"blaming the victim.\"  John E. Stafford  Rye, N.Y.

       " 'Banking Equity release: read these top tips before you borrow against your home Equity release is becoming more popular among older homeowners. It allows those aged 55 or more to borrow a lump sum against the value of their home, with interest payments normally deferred until the house is sold when the owner dies or goes into care.  There are various reasons why equity release might be attractive to homeowners: they may want cash to help a grandchild buy a home, for example, or may need to supplement their own pension income - there are versions of equity release that allow you to make regular withdrawals.  If you do withdraw a lump sum, you can choose to make interest payments so that the sum repayable does not grow; if you allow interest to roll up instead, the amount borrowed can become very large should you live a long time, although equity release plans come with a \"no negative equity\" guarantee.  There are several crucial things to consider before you choose equity release.  Nigel Waterson, chairman of the Equity Release Council, the industry body, said: \"For anyone considering taking out an equity release plan, there are a number of things to consider.  \"First and foremost, it is important that you speak with a qualified adviser who belongs to the Equity Release Council. They will be able to provide you with professional guidance and will ensure that you are able to consider all your options.\"  Here are ten top tips to consider:  * Do some research. Unbiased information can be found via the Money Advice Service Guide to Retirement and at equityreleasecouncil.com .  * Consider all your options. Make sure all state benefits are claimed and think about downsizing, renting out a room or asking for help from your family.  * If you take out an equity release plan to pay off an interest-only mortgage, speak with your existing lender to discuss all the options they can offer.  * Discuss your plans with family. They may be able to help or support your decision to take equity release.  * Compile a budget planner to work out what your income requirements are and how they might change over the years.  * If equity release is needed for home improvements, check to see if the local authority offers any grants for the work required.  * Don\\'t take for granted what others tell you about equity release but make sure you speak with a qualified adviser who is a member of the Equity Release Council.  * In addition, take independent legal advice.  * Consider the type of equity release you need. An adviser will help you understand the difference between home reversion plans (where ownership is transferred to the lender at the outset), lifetime mortgages and the different types of plan.  * Don\\'t assume that the lowest interest rate is the best. The plans have various features, some of which may be more suitable. For instance, some allow you to make monthly repayments to avoid the interest rolling up.  Sign up to our emails',\n",
       " \"Getting a loan is all about risk IF YOU are thinking about applying for a home loan, it's important to gain an understanding of what the banks and lenders look for in the approval process.  The lender will assess your financial position and ability to service the loan, and based on the level of risk that you impose on them, will make a decision on how much or how little they are prepared to lend you, says Loan Market.  Let's look at some of the important key measures used by lenders to help assess your risk.  Income  Your current income will be used to determine the amount of money you can borrow.  Earning a higher income could suggest that you are able to better service your home loan.  But it's not just about what you earn - the lender will also look at your employment history and tenure.  In addition, they will assess your employment status (i.e. full-time, part-time, casual, permanent) to better understand your position.  In the case of self-employed applicants, the process may require more work and further lender scrutiny as the risk is usually higher.  Credit history  Your credit history gives the lender an indication of how you conduct your debts.  Having a clean credit history can increase your chances of borrowing a higher amount because it demonstrates that you are a responsible borrower.  You can request a copy of your credit file to ensure there isn't a black mark against your name.  The last thing you want is to be knocked back by your lender because of a telco default you incurred a few years ago.  In Australia, you can obtain your credit report from VEDA for free.  Deposit amount  The larger the amount you have for a deposit, the less risk the lender is taking when lending to you.  Having regular and consistent deposits made into your bank account will show the lender your ability to save despite having other current expenses.  Debts  Having debts can also determine your borrowing eligibility.  If you have any outstanding debts such as credit cards or personal loans, it would be beneficial to have them paid off before applying for a home loan.  If you have multiple debts, combining them into one could also help to reduce your repayments, which will look more favourable to the lender.  The lender will assess how much money you have left over (after paying your debts) and determine whether you will still be able to afford paying a mortgage.  A mortgage broker plays a key role when you're looking for home loan approval.  You can speak to them about the best way to position yourself to maximise your chances of having your home loan approved.  If you're looking to roll your debts into one, a mortgage broker can talk to you about your options when it comes to a consolidation loan.  This can not only reduce your monthly repayments but can also get you a lower interest rate.\",\n",
       " 'Business Warning on rate hikes HOME loan borrowers face a short and sharp series of interest rate hikes which threaten to add an extra $375 to the average monthly repayment bill, a former Reserve Bank board member has warned.  Highly-respected economist John Edwards says home loan borrowers should brace for eight consecutive hikes to the nation\\'s official cash rate over the next two years.  Mr Edwards said the cash rate is \"way below\" where it needs to be should the RBA\\'s own economic growth and inflation forecasts pan out.  The cash rate would need to be hiked from 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent by the end of 2019 if Australia\\'s economic growth rate return to 3 per cent in the next few years as the RBA expects, Dr Edwards said.  The average standard variable mortgage would rise from 4.44 per cent to 6.44 per cent under such a scenario, analysis from financial services firm Mozo shows.  A borrower with a $300,000 loan would need to find $375 extra per month. \"It seems to me that something like eight quarter-percentage-point tightenings over 2018 and 2019 are distinctly possible if the RBA\\'s economic forecasts prove correct,\" Dr Edwards wrote in a paper for the Lowy Institute think tank.  \"It\\'s possible the tightening could start earlier, or if not the tightening itself, at least the signalling which should precede it.  \"We may be seeing a little of that now.\" Dr Edwards said the current cash rate was outside any historic norm given it had averaged 5.2 per cent over the past 20 years and only fell to 3 per cent in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.  While the RBA would not want to increase rates \"too abruptly or unexpectedly\", Dr Edwards cautioned the inevitable lift in borrowing costs would not necessarily be \"gentle or gradual.\" Former RBA governor Ian Macfarlane hiked the cash rate 1.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent in the 10 months to August 2000 while his successor Glenn Stevens took less than two years to lift the rate from 5.5 per cent in April 2006 to 7.25 per cent in March 2008.  The Bank for International Settlements, the governing body of central banks, this week warned Australia\\'s record levels of household debt leaves it highly vulnerable to a sharp rise in global interest rates.  AMP Capital chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said Dr Edward\\'s forecast \"seemed extreme\" and noted the RBA had consistently over-estimated economic growth in recent years.  Dr Oliver said low wage growth and underemployment would keep inflation low for the foreseeable future.  \"I struggle to see much of any interest rate hikes in the coming years,\" he said.

The Trump administration being the third one to look at the rule - behind the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush (yes, at the time it was called the Investment Advice Rule) - \"shows you how incredibly important the private pension system, broadly defined, is to our safety net of this country,\" Wagner said Tuesday at the Financial Planning Association\\'s annual lobbying day in Washington.  (Related: House GOP Introduces Bill to Overturn DOL Fiduciary Rule)  \"Appropriate oversight of fiduciary activity is necessary to protect retail investors who rely on pension and IRA assets for their security in old age ? without due protections - and we can debate if the fiduciary rule goes too far or far enough - the U.S. can find itself in the unenviable position of countries where adequate protections are non-existent, and people are invariably harmed.\"  Wagner, an attorney with the Wagner Law Group who is a ThinkAdvisor contributor, gave three reasons why she believes Labor\\'s fiduciary rule will remain in \"substantially similar condition\":  * The entities affected by the rule \"have already devoted considerable time, expertise, money and resources from marketing to legal to IT in determining appropriate implementation.\"  * There\\'s really \"no clear course of action if this rule doesn\\'t go forward,\" she said. \"We really can\\'t go back to the 1976 regulation defining investment advice on that five-pronged test. That standard is ? frankly, very dated.\"  * The fiduciary law is \"going to go forward in substantially similar condition as it is right now because the opposition to the rule ? is gone. Certain areas of the industry are in favor, certain others aren\\'t. United, people can do a lot; divided, the government will get what it wants. In my view, .? the vector of this rule is the correct way to go for our country.\"  As of June 9, parts of the rule became effective - the definition of fiduciary has been \"significantly expanded\" and is in effect now, as well as the impartial conduct standard, Wagner said. Full applicability with the rule will occur, as of now, on Jan. 1.  Also in force as of June 9 is a \"non-enforcement policy\" by Labor, which the IRS will follow, that requires advisors \"behave in reasonable and good-faith compliance with the law into Dec. 31, 2017.\"  However, Wagner warned, the non-enforcement policy \"does not mean that private litigants can\\'t litigate.

The 1 retirement expense that might catch you off guard  Clients should not underestimate the impact of taxes on their income after they retire, as their tax liability could reduce substantially their net earnings, according to this article on Motley Fool. Retirees are expected to face a tax bill on distributions from their traditional 401(k) and IRAs and on a portion of their Social Security benefits. They will also owe taxes on their gains from taxable accounts.  Do you need to pay off your mortgage before you retire?  Lower-income families with less than a million dollars in total investable assets stand to gain more from paying off their home mortgage before retirement compared with wealthy households, according to this article on MarketWatch. Families with more than $1 million invested assets should treat debt the way companies do and use it to limit their risk exposure. \"You are a lot better off if you can bring more money to the table through the strategic use of debt and then target a lower, less-volatile return,\" says an expert.  Beware the impact on RMDs when reversing a Roth IRA conversion  Undoing a Roth conversion could have an impact on a 73-year-old retiree\\'s required minimum distribution from his traditional IRA for this year, according to this article on Kiplinger. Converting the IRA assets to a Roth would be excluded from RMD calculation for 2017, but recharacterizing it and getting back the money paid for taxes on the converted amount would mean an increase in the RMD amount and the subsequent tax. \"If all or a portion of the conversion is reversed, an adjustment to the December 31, 2016, balance needs to be made, thus increasing the 2017 RMD,\" says a retirement strategist.  Ask Larry: Will I get the maximum benefit at age 66?  Clients may calculate their Social Security retirement benefits based on their 35 highest years of inflated adjusted earnings, according to this article on Forbes. People who earned the maximum amount in all those years before turning 66 this year can expect the maximum benefit of $2,687 if they start collecting this year. The benefit would increase if they continue to work and earn more than the previous 35 best earning years.

       " 'Financial Services Ex-Challenger exec betting on robo-advice A long-serving Challenger executive has become a \"material investor\" in a robo-adviser and plans to use the technology to drive a new advice platform, which he says will deliver cost-effective financial advice to Australia\\'s growing cohort of retirees.  Paul Rogan, the former chief executive of distribution, marketing and research who stepped out of the role in February after 12 years at Australia\\'s largest annuities provider, is now readying to launch Retirement Essentials, an online platform that educates and assists those who are already in retirement on how to manage their money.  \"For years at Challenger we\\'ve been working on getting quality retirement income models into the market for financial advisers,\" Mr Rogan said.  \"I\\'m now looking to provide these models to the Australian retirees who are not getting support from financial advisers. My aim is to create a trusted advice brand in the retirement market to help retirees control their own finances and make them feel more confident about their life.\"  Mr Rogan has invested an undisclosed sum in SuperEd, the the robo-adviser co-founded in 2012 by Vanguard Australia founder Jeremy Duffield and Westpac executive and technology entrepreneur Hugh Morrow.  SuperEd will provide a \"digitally enabled adviser\" to the Retirement Essentials website which Mr Rogan says will provide guidance to Australians who cannot afford traditional advice.  In January, Mr Duffield told The Australian Financial Review that he was looking to raise up to $6 million to roll out its platform to some of Australia\\'s largest profit-for-member funds.  SuperEd currently has relationships with Challenge and insurer AIA, but has a number of deals with industry superannuation funds in the pipeline.  \"We think it\\'s important for them [superannuation fund members] to establish a dialogue with their fund and have a conversation about their financial issues. So when they have a problem there is a way to resolve that without having to pay,\" SuperEd chief executive Hugh Morrow said.  Keeping their members at retirement is a big concern for Australia\\'s super funds, when many choose to leave, and Mr Morrow said that providing \"highly personalised and goals-based financial advice\" was key for retention.  Currently the bank-owned funds dominate the post-retirement space, as Chanticleer wrote recently.  Digital advice is widely seen as way to keep members at the critical moment of retirement, with Coredata research that robo-advisers are more trusted than both bank-aligned financial advisers and independent financial advisers. \"The game is to build confidence and understanding so that they can put in place a retirement plan,\" said Mr Morrow.  \"So that might be someone in their 40s or 50s, and bit by bit they can build that into a plan in their late 50s.\"  \"It\\'s a very different conversation to have with the consumer, than a simple, short process. It\\'s a discussion that is going to happen over years rather than a one-off session.\"\\xa0',\n",

       " 'Markets PNC, in Fiduciary Move, Offers \\'Clean\\' Mutual Fund Shares; Broker-dealer\\'s product to charge fee only to manage, operate funds to help comply with Labor Department rule PNC Investments LLC has begun offering mutual-fund share classes stripped of any distribution fees in its tax-qualified brokerage retirement accounts, a move that coincides with the deadline for initial implementation the Labor Department\\'s fiduciary rule.  Such lower-cost shares are now being launched by many fund companies in part to help advisers and brokers comply with the new retirement-savings rule, which is aimed at curbing conflicted advice on retirement accounts. The rule will require that financial advisers who make recommendations on assets in individual retirement accounts receive compensation that doesn\\'t offer them an incentive to choose one product over another for a client.  The new \"clean shares\" offered by PNC Investments, the broker-dealer subsidiary of PNC Financial Services Group Inc., will charge only the fee to manage and operate the funds. The shares won\\'t include any fees to compensate brokers for providing advice or 12b-1 fees, which pay for marketing, printing and prospectuses and other shareholder services.  With the new shares, broker-dealers and other distributors will have to charge directly for their services, as PNC Investments plans to do, which will make it clear to investors how much they\\'re paying to whom and for what. Firms that wish to continue to receive commissions can sell clean shares, then set their own commissions that are the same across products, as PNC Investments plans to do.  \"Charging a direct commission helps to bring more transparency to the clients on what they are paying for,\" said Robert Santillo, PNC Investments\\' managing director of product management and research. The new share classes also remove complexity because one share class can be used rather than numerous different types, which can be confusing to investors, he says.  PNC Investments plans to offer the new clean shares in its brokerage retirement accounts as well as to clients in its fee-based advisory business-which charges a fee based on a client\\'s assets under management. It has already converted more than half of the existing assets in its fee-based advisory business to the new shares, and it plans to convert the remaining assets to the shares by year\\'s end.  In the next few months, PNC Investments also plans to offer the clean shares in its taxable accounts.  The fiduciary rule remains under review by the Trump administration, but should it be altered or rescinded, that will have no bearing on PNC Investments\\' use of the clean shares, Mr. Santillo said.  PNC Investments services about $50 billion in client assets through its bank broker-dealer model, part of its investment and retirement businesses. Mutual funds account for nearly 40% of PNC Investments\\' assets under management, and about half of those assets are invested in commissionable brokerage accounts today.

       " 'Financial Adviser: Tata Steel pension scheme transfers double Senior managers with Tata Steel transferred their pensions out of the company pension fund as the steelmaker negotiated a deal to cut the retirement incomes of the scheme\\'s 126,000 members, according to a Financial Times report.  The trustees of the British Steel Pension Scheme, BSPS, confirmed to FTAdviser\\'s sister newspaper that senior managers were among current and former unretired employees of Tata Steel to have cashed in their final salary pensions.  The numbers transferring out of the BSPS fund have more than doubled as employees have been attracted by the rise in the value of transfer values made to those leaving defined benefit schemes over the past two years.  Speaking to the Financial Times, the BSPS trustees said: \"The number of transfers completed during the year to 31 March 2017 was 482 (the comparative figure for the previous year was 170).  \"Included within the figure of 482 would be a very small number of current and former senior managers, consistent with the numbers overall.\"  Details of the transfer activity came a month after Tata announced it had reached a deal with BSPS to decouple the £15bn retirement fund from the business, after more than a year of intensive talks with The Pensions Regulator.  The trustees have backed the plan to separate the scheme from Tata, which would involve benefit reductions for tens of thousands of members but keep members out of the pensions lifeboat fund, where compensation could be lower for some.  Writing in a trustee update to members on 16 May, the BSPS trustee chairman, Allan Johnston, said: \"Although the Pension Protection Fund is an important safeguard for pension schemes generally, the trustee believes that the BSPS has sufficient assets to offer members the potential for better outcomes by enabling them to transfer to another scheme offering modified benefits.  \"For most scheme members, these modified benefits are expected to be of greater value than those they would otherwise receive by transferring into the PPF.\"  John Ralfe, an independent pensions expert, told the Financial Times: \"BSPS has improved its cash transfer values in the last few months, to reflect the scheme\\'s lower risk investment strategy.  \"The fact that a member transferring now gets more cash, may explain the marked increase in the number of people transferring.\"  Tata declined to comment.  Last year, the trustees wrote to members setting out proposals to separate the pension plan, with an estimated £400m deficit at the time, from the business with the fund seen as a financial drag on the company.  Under the terms of the deal announced last month, both unretired and retired members of BSPS will see lower payouts.  The 482 members who had opted to quit the scheme by taking their future pension as a lump sum will not be affected by the arrangement, yet to be approved by the regulator.  About 33,000 of the scheme\\'s 126,000 members had been potentially eligible to cash in their pensions.  stephanie.hawthorne@ft.com',\n",
       " \"Business Figure out what you'll need to save for retirement in five simple steps; Here's one way to arrive at a ball park figure for your own circumstances Financial planners dread being asked how much money people need before they can say good-bye to work. It depends, planners say, and so it does - on how much you make, on what age you want to retire, on your current standard of living, on your workplace pension (or lack thereof) and on your tolerance for risk, just for starters.  So let's acknowledge that there is no simple one-size-fits-all answer to this question. That said, here's one way to arrive at a ball park figure for your own circumstances.  1) Start by figuring out how much of your working income you're going to need to replace in retirement. Most people find 50 per cent to 70 per cent is adequate. You can get a more precise idea by visiting our replacement ratio calculator.  For subscribers: The surprising truth about how much you need to save for a happy retirement  2) Consider how much you can expect to receive from government programs such as Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security. The combined payout for a lifelong resident of Canada who has worked steadily for decades and is just beginning to collect now, at the age of 65, would typically be around $15,000 a year but could be significantly lower or higher depending on salary history and other factors. You can see what you will receive by visiting the federal government's retirement income calculator.  3) Do the math. Start by figuring out what your replacement ratio means in dollars. If your household income is $120,000 a year, and you need a 60 per cent replacement ratio, your target retirement income will be $72,000 a year. To calculate how much of this must come out of your own pocket, subtract government stipends from the target figure. In this example, if CPP and OAS will pay you and your spouse a combined $30,000 a year, that reduces the amount you must generate from private sources to $42,000 a year.  4) Your workplace pension may cover most of this gap. If not, or if you don't have a workplace pension, you can figure out what it would cost to generate $42,000 by looking at how much it would cost to purchase an annuity that would pay you that amount every year. You can find annuity rates here.  5) Stuff happens. Maybe you'll get a divorce. Maybe you'll wind up in a long-term care facility. If it helps you sleep better, you may want to add a buffer of $100,000 or so to the previous total to help cushion such contingencies.

       " 'Most employees fail to understand basic retirement concepts Working Americans of all ages are plagued by widespread misconceptions and procrastination that could undermine their retirement readiness - unless they devote enough time to learning basic concepts, Fidelity Investments\\' first-ever Retirement IQ Survey finds.  Most notably, as many as two-thirds of the respondents underestimated what they will need to save for retirement.  \"While we know from previous studies we\\'ve conducted that Americans have made progress in covering essential expenses in retirement, we wanted a better understanding around what people comprehend when it comes to retirement basics,\" says Ken Hevert, SVP of retirement at Fidelity Investments.  While noting that progress has been made to move the needle on retirement readiness, he says the survey\\'s knowledge gaps point to the need for better education. Hevert believes employers, along with their advisers, are positioned to help educate, inspire and motivate employees to be proactive and start saving early.  \"We recognize how important it is for employers to engage with their plan participants as early as possible because it\\'s often in the workplace where people first learn about what they need to do to prepare for retirement,\" he says.  Also see: \"16 areas where employers most want help from their broker.\"  The survey identified procrastination as a serious concern. More than half of respondents confessed to putting off an important financial decision such as creating a budget, paying bills on time or saving for retirement.  Failing grade  Many people surveyed, including those age 55 and older, gave wrong answers to questions in nearly every category, even though it was a multiple-choice format, according to Hevert. He says the average grade was 30% (the equivalent of an F), no one answered all 14 questions correctly and 1% got all of the questions wrong. Fewer than 0.5% of respondents received a 79% (C+), which was the highest grade.  The question most people answered correctly concerned the age of Medicare eligibility (77% got it right), while there was a three-way tie for toughest question, which only 14% answered correctly. Those results included:  · Number of years out of the past 35 with a positive market return (about 60% thought it was half the time or less, whereas the correct answer was 80% of the time).  · Future value of $50 a month earning market average return (half underestimated it).  · Largest expense for most retirees (most wrongly guessed healthcare, whereas the correct answer is housing).  Despite these poor test results, Hevert emphasizes that by spending just a few hours on the subject, working Americans can boost their Retirement IQ scores dramatically and develop a good grasp of the essentials needed to make smarter decisions that can put them on the path to a secure retirement. The employer-based system can encourage plan participants to think about the goals they want to achieve and develop a plan to get there, which he says starts with knowing where they stand in order to identify opportunities to improve.',\n",
       " 'Pro Bankruptcy Scurria\\'s Take: Puerto Rico\\'s Descent Into Bankruptcy Divides Wall Street Puerto Rico\\'s creditors are preparing for a lengthy fight to maximize their recoveries after its slide into bankruptcy. But other Wall Street investors are rooting for the U.S. territory to succeed in driving down its $73 billion debt load.  Creditors holding Puerto Rico\\'s municipal bonds argue the territory won\\'t regain access to the high-yield credit markets if a court writes down the value of its bonds too deeply, according to court filings and congressional testimony. Puerto Rico was cut off from the credit markets in 2015, and restoring market access is a must for the federal oversight board handling its financial restructuring.  But investors who don\\'t have bonds at risk in the court-supervised process are advocating aggressive debt restructuring to free up taxpayer resources for other purposes-such as infrastructure investments-and to pave the way for island\\'s bonds to begin performing again.  Dave Hammer, head of municipal bond portfolio management at Pacific Investment Management Co., said Puerto Rico needs to give investors confidence in its ability to meet its obligations by scaling down its debt to levels its economy can sustain. That means cutting the value of most bonds below their current trading prices, he said.  PIMCO holds no Puerto Rico general obligation or sales-tax bonds, which together represent $30 billion in debt, although the firm said it recently bought some agency bonds backed by earmarked revenue streams.  \"We think a bigger haircut is required than what is currently implied by market prices,\" Mr. Hammer said. \"The key is to get investors like PIMCO off the sidelines.\"  John Ceffalio, vice president and municipal credit analyst at AllianceBernstein LP, said his firm would like to invest in Puerto Rico again but would first need to see a restoration of economic growth, a sustainably balanced budget and \"a reduction in liabilities to an affordable level\" through debt restructuring.  The more Puerto Rico is able to shrink its debt burden, the more money presumably will be available to pay back its restructured bonds, improving those securities\\' performance in the market.  Current creditors, on the other hand, say Puerto Rico should repay as much of its $73 billion in debt as it can to placate investors, reaffirm its willingness to pay and entice them to lend again.  Hedge funds, mutual funds and bond insurers with billions of dollars in Puerto Rico claims on the line have also warned of contagion effects in the U.S. municipal marketplace if deep losses scare investors and make financing more difficult for other issuers struggling with pension funding gaps, junk bond ratings and collapsing infrastructures.  But the municipal marketplace has outperformed other asset classes even as Puerto Rico\\'s credit quality deteriorated, Mr. Hammer said. Puerto Rico\\'s benchmark securities are also virtually unchanged from before its placement under court protection, which was widely expected.  Write to Andrew Scurria at Andrew.Scurria@wsj.com',\n",

Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) and Dan Lipinski (D-Ill.) today visited Aon apprentices and announced their bipartisan bill to reinvigorate America\\'s apprenticeship programs in our skilled industries. Davis and Lipinski recently reintroduced the LEAP Act (H.R. 2399), which uses tax incentives to encourage more companies to offer apprenticeship programs.  \"Reducing college debt has been a focus of mine since coming to Congress and apprenticeships can help with this,\" said Davis. \"For example, the apprentices at Aon learn valuable workplace skills while also attending college classes to complete an associate\\'s degree. At the end of the program, these young men and women have a job and a college degree that didn\\'t require any student loans. We want more companies to utilize apprenticeships, not only to help reduce college debt, but also to help retrain our workforce. The LEAP Act will help us accomplish this important, bipartisan goal.\"  \"Apprenticeships provide highly valuable opportunities to combine learning in the classroom with learning on the job while earning a paycheck,\" said Lipinski. \"If we can get more people into apprenticeships, we can make a great difference in their lives while also helping businesses find the skilled employees they need. I am very impressed with Aon\\'s apprenticeship program and their apprentices, and the LEAP Act will help more businesses to follow Aon\\'s lead.\"  \"Apprenticeships are a proven model for training and building a career- now it\\'s time to make apprenticeships look more like today\\'s economy,\" said Bridget Gainer, Vice President of Global Affairs at Aon.  Key details of the LEAP Act include:  * Offering a federal tax credit for hiring new apprentices that are registered with the U.S. Department of Labor or a state apprenticeship agency.  * Addressing the fact that the average age of apprentices is currently as high as 29 by offering a tax credit of $1,500 for apprentices under 25. The tax credit for apprentices over 25 is $1,000.  * Being fully paid for through an offset: cutting printing waste by barring the federal government from producing publications that are available online with an exception for seniors, Medicare recipients and in communities with limited internet access.  Aon apprenticeship details:  * Aon created an apprenticeship program and has urged peers across the industry to follow their lead in order to close that training gap.  * Apprentices are trained in account management, client support, financial analysis, and technology.  * Aon will hire 25 apprentices each year for the next four years.  * Apprentices are paid for full-time work, even though some of their time is spent in class.  * Participants get an education - graduating with an associate\\'s degree from Harold Washington College, which Aon covers the cost.  * Apprentices will graduate with an industry-recognized apprenticeship experience, in addition to an associate\\'s degree.

       " 'Participant Understanding of Fees Improves Only Slowly The Department of Labor has enacted a number of initiatives in the last decade to increase retirement plan fee and pricing transparency, but participant awareness of what and how they pay continues to lag. \\xa0\\xa0  Mandatory fee disclosures under 408(b)(2) and 404(a)(5) were put in place to boost transparency and communication regarding retirement plan provider fees, services and potential conflicts of interest.  However experts widely agree that, while the regulations certainly made much more information available to plan participants, relatively few retirement plan investors take full advantage of the increased disclosures.\\xa0  \"I suspect that some plan participants use the disclosures as best as they can, and probably a lot of participants just throw it away,\" says Aron Szapiro, director of policy research at Morningstar. \"Or they don\\'t look at the disclosures until there is some big decision point coming, but then they need a little extra help to contextualize it.\"  Jim Sampson, director of retirement advisory services at Hilb Group Retirement Services, believes that fee disclosures have benefited the small group of participants who are drawn to make the effort to understand retirement plan fees, but \"this is clearly not every participant.\"  \"That\\'s what the plan fee disclosures have done, opened the eyes of people who pay attention,\" he says. \"Unfortunately, not everybody pays attention.\"  Will Hansen, senior vice president of retirement and compensation policy for the ERISA Industry Committee (ERIC), agrees that promoting understanding of fee disclosures is a big challenge right now. He says he believes transparency and awareness \"start with genuine engagement between a plan sponsor and participant, especially through financial wellness programs.\"  \"If you engage an individual at the very basic level of even doing some simple budgeting types of exercises, hopefully you can build off of that foundation and get to the point where you then get a little further into the weeds of explaining to a person what and how they pay for the plan,\" Hansen suggests. \"In addition, many plan sponsors say they would benefit from more transparency around what other plan sponsor are paying. Anything you can do to sort of contextualize what these fees mean overtime is going to be valuable.\"  Although education on fee disclosures is essential, to Sampson, just as important is to ensure participants can understand the overall value of their plan in a simplified manner. Whereas fee disclosures highlight the charges participants pay for each part of the plan, Sampson urges plan sponsors and participants to weigh this information against \"the real value associated with the plan.\"  \"There\\'s an awful lot of emphasis on fees within 401(k) plans, where, maybe instead there should be a little more emphasis on the value side of the equation,\" he says. \"What are you getting for those fees?\"  Szapiro agrees, and emphasizes the \"imperative role plan sponsors play in interpreting fees and value and providing the best options, and keeping the participants\\' interest in mind.\"  editors@assetinternational.com',\n",
       " 'Lifestyle Expert help needed to navigate way through estate law COUPLES in a second (or subsequent) relationships with children from previous relationships often have wills that leave everything to each other. They agree that when the second partner dies, they will leave half their assets to the children of the first partner to die.  However, when one partner dies, it is very common for the other partner to eventually change their will to exclude the other\\'s children. It is only natural that you want your estate to benefit your own children, who support you in your later years. The survivor rarely has a close continuing relationship with their stepchildren after their partner dies. It is very common for people to form new relationships after a partner dies - often surprisingly quickly.  You might take the \"don\\'t worry about it\" approach and expect your partner not to exclude your children from their will, after you die. In reality, you are making the choice that: \"My children should not expect to receive anything if I die first.\" Your partner will inevitably change their will after you die, as they move on and their life circumstances change. The more time that passes after the first dies, the more certain it becomes that the survivor will change their will.  Even if the surviving partner does not change their will, there is every possibility they will end up in another relationship. That may make it impossible for them to honour any agreement not to change their will. Remarriage would void the current will. A new de facto partner could challenge their will, even if they honour the agreement not to change their will.  You could enter into a contract with each other not to change your wills after the other dies. However, there are significant difficulties with this. If the survivor nevertheless changes their will, the new will is valid. Your children would have the right to sue the estate of your partner, if they do change their will. That requires expensive litigation. The disappointed beneficiaries may not be able to afford to pursue litigation. Lawyers may end up with more of your estate than your beneficiaries.  A testamentary trust can be used to preserve interests of children of the first to die.  This may be the only option that can work without unacceptable side effects. They are however by their nature complex and as a result easy to get very wrong and usually relatively expensive if done well.

       " 'Money A feel-bad factor as npower break into my late granny\\'s home They removed the gas and electricity meter for non-payment, despite me telling them she\\'d died a year before  Npower broke into my grandmother\\'s house and removed the gas and electricity meters, despite having been told a year ago that she\\'d died. It justified the forced entry by claiming she owed £1,300, a bill it admitted had been wrongly estimated. In fact, £300 was owing but was only unpaid because npower hadn\\'t updated its systems when we reported her death.  It told us that it had tried to phone prior to breaking in, causing £100-worth of damage. It turns out it had not logged her death on the system.  Over two months, I and several other relatives had to take annual leave to keep appointments with npower, several of which were missed without explanation. I had to spend four hours waiting in the unheated house on the first anniversary of her death, only to be told that npower had no note of the appointment, despite me confirming it with them that morning. I\\'ve also had to chase third-party contractors on npower\\'s behalf to reinstate the meters.  After offering £50 to repair the damage and £120 for the missed appointments and stress, npower has closed our complaint and accused us of \"chasing compensation\". It\\'s ironic that \"get the feel-good factor\" is one of its slogans. We don\\'t feel good. HS, Ilkley, Yorkshire  When npower writes to you again it makes no bones about the fact that it was prompted by The Observer. It\\'s wondrous how the media spotlight can cause the blindest companies to see clearly, and what npower suddenly sees is that it had been advised of your grandmother\\'s death but has no record of it, and that it broke in to fit a pre-payment meter despite also being told by a neighbour that the owner had died and it had missed \"several\" appointments. It ups its compensation offer to £500 and candidly admits this is \"following a discussion with our press office\".  Its contrition, or rather its fear of a damaging headline, would seem more plausible if it didn\\'t then send your late grandmother a letter asking her to set up a direct debit. It says it will raise this as a \"query\" rather than a complaint because, following its burst of largesse, it considers the case closed.  After more to-ing and fro-ing, however, it agrees to pay £970 for the stress, distress and the expenses you\\'ve been put to. Npower says: \"We have been in contact with the customer to apologise and resolve the issues. The account has now been updated as required.\"  If you need help email Anna Tims at  your.problems@observer.co.uk  or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

One in eight households in England are failing to take \"the most basic\" fire prevention measures in their properties because they don\\'t have a working smoke alarm, according to new research.  figcreditAlamy  More than a fifth of households in England have never tested their smoke alarm to see if it works[/caption]  With more than 90 per cent of domestic fires accidental  ,  having a fully functional smoke alarm could make a huge difference in the event of a fire.  Research by Direct Line Home Insurance found that 12 per cent of properties across the country do not contain a working smoke alarm, amounting to around 2.7million households.  And more than a fifth of households - just under five million homes - have never tested their smoke alarm to see if it works.  Direct Line said people were putting themselves at risk by not having working smoke alarms in their properties.  When looking at the causes of accidental domestic fires, it found that cooking appliances accounted for nearly a third of all incidents across England, with 16,549 out of a total of 53,725 fires.  Of this number, more than half of incidents involved cookers, while other cooking appliances responsible for domestic blazes include microwaves and barbecues, while grills and toasters are responsible for around a tenth of all fires.  figcreditAlamy  Cooking appliances account for nearly a third of all domestic fires across England[/caption]  According to Direct Line\\'s research, in half of all fires in 2014/15 there was either a smoke alarm that was broken (20 per cent) or no smoke alarm at all (30 per cent).  It also found that a quarter of accidental fires take place between the hours of 5pm and 8pm, with almost a third occurring on the weekend.  One in ten fires take place overnight, the insurer said.  You should:  liTest your smoke alarm when the clocks change  liGently remove dust from the sensors using a soft brush twice a year  liOnce a year change the battery (unless it\\'s a ten-year alarm)  liReplace your alarm after 10 years  liTest your alarm once a month to ensure it\\'s working properly  Rebecca Clapham of Direct Line, said: \"This research shows that fires can happen at any time.

       " 'Back Page Protect yourself from politics Investors must go global as a shield against uncertainty  POLITICAL uncertainty is one of the worst things that could happen to your investment portfolio. Unlike risk - which can be measured up to a point - the impact of uncertainty requires a wait-and-see approach.  Karin Richards, an independent trader, says it\\'s for these moments you should have stocks that hedge against rand movements: companies with a diversified geographical presence.  \"Look for well-managed companies with hard currency earnings,\" says Richards. Her picks for long-term hedging are British American Tobacco, property group Hammerson, mining company Glencore, retail group Steinhoff and paper and pulp manufacturer Mondi.  Richards says it\\'s important to look at the company\\'s geographical split of revenue and earnings.  Many companies provide a table of sensitivities to the currencies that impact them most in the \"analyst fact book\" section or in the company\\'s results presentation booklet, she says.  Investors should ensure that foreign-denominated debt is matched by revenue in percentage terms. \"If 10% of debt is in euros, check that roughly 10% of revenue is also in euros.\"  Exchange traded funds that track international indices are a great way to venture into international markets without having the worry of having to pick individual stocks.  Choosing an ETF like DB-X Eurostoxx 50, which Richards says is an \"excellent rand hedge\", along with the DB-X US, might make sense.  The Eurostoxx tracks the top 50 companies in the eurozone, while the DB-X US tracks the MSCI USA index, which measures the performance of the US economy.  However, she cautions that \"after an eight-year bull market, investors should stagger their buying and keep some cash for the inevitable dips\".  Kristia van Heerden, CEO of investment education platform Just One Lap, says some of her picks for international exposure are the CoreShares S& P Global Property and CoreShares S& P500 ETF.  The property fund tracks top property companies across eight countries. The CoreShares S& P500 ETF tracks 500 US shares.  As the rand had been strong recently (but is now rapidly weakening), pay attention to your timing.  Buying foreign stocks when the rand is on a downward spiral could lose you money.  Local stocks tend to be affected by rand movements and political noise. For example, since the recall of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan from Europe on Monday last week, the JSE Banks index has fallen by around 13%.  But beware of being tempted to sell in a panic: such a move would be rash, says Van Heerden.  Instead of succumbing to your emotions, snap up some stocks that are good value, or simply hold on to what you have and ignore the noise.  As an investor, you can never be certain what elements - be they political, economic or industry specific - could affect your portfolio.  Taking well-thought-out safety measures now could end up saving you a lot of money.  & x95;Follow Tsamela on Twitter @DineoTsamela  Cap',\n",
       " 'Real Estate Saskatoon housing market stable despite downturn Home sales in some areas surrounding Saskatoon fell off a cliff in the first quarter of 2017, but the city\\'s real estate market appears to be holding on amid a commodities downturn that has led to layoffs, soaring vacancy rates and deep government cuts.  Saskatoon recorded 723 sales worth a total of $246 million in the first three months of the year, compared to 714 sales totalling $245.8 million in the same period last year, according to the Saskatoon Region Association of Realtors (SRAR).  \"We\\'ve got a very diverse economy, and there\\'s a lot of other industries that aren\\'t directly impacted by the commodity prices that are doing well, and that trickles down to other businesses,\" SRAR CEO Jason Yochim said.  At the same time, stable sales figures and prices - the average price of a home in Saskatoon declined just 1.2 per cent from the first quarter of 2016, to $340,303 - could also be a result of people choosing to hold onto their properties, he said.  \"I think (people will avoid selling) as long as they can afford to keep the payments going, even if they\\'re underwater. It\\'s usually a pretty stable place to keep your money parked.\"  Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) officials came to a similar conclusion earlier this year, noting that a 0.97 per cent year-over-year decline in the city\\'s home price index suggests financial distress is not at a level where people are choosing to sell.  \"People, even if they\\'ve lost their job, they\\'ll run through their savings, they\\'ll take on part-time jobs, they\\'ll do things they\\'re not proud of to pay the mortgage,\" CREA chief economist Gregory Klump said in a February interview.  SRAR statistics released this week paint a bleaker picture of real estate sales in the communities surrounding Saskatoon, where 167 properties worth a total of $56.2 million changed hands in the first quarter, down 12.6 per cent from the first three months of 2016.  Yochim said the bulk of that decline is attributable to small towns, acreages and farms, because home sales in Warman and Martensville - the two largest communities in the region - remained relatively flat year-over-year.  Martensville\\'s population ballooned by 25 per cent over the last five years, but growth has since slowed to more sustainable levels, allowing commercial and industrial development to catch up, according to Mayor Kent Muench.  While housing prices have shot up over the last decade, sales remain steady, largely due to a wide variety of amenities that have moved into the city over the last several years, Muench said.  \"I think the trend overall in Martensville and other places is the market is definitely (leaning) more toward smaller houses, smaller lots - not what they were before 2007.\"  amacpherson@postmedia.com( mailto:amacpherson@postmedia.com )  twitter.com/macphersona( http://www.twitter.com/macphersona )',\n",

The firm - which also owns Halifax and the Bank of Scotland - and caters for over 30 million UK consumers, has revealed a reform of its current branch network - replacing \\'key\\' locations with \\'micro\\' style branches and in some cases boarding up the old counter sections.  The news comes just one year after the group announced plans to axe 400 of its branches around the UK , with 9,000 job losses.  Under the \\'transformation\\', medium-sized existing branches will become \"community\" branches - in rural areas - or \"anchor\" branches in towns and cities.  Thousands of Halifax customers owed up to £100 over \\'missing\\' rewards payments - how to check if you\\'re due cash back  The new \"micro branches\" will be staffed by just two people, who will help customers use machines and pay-in devices.  Around 25 new \"micro\" stores will open - with many smaller town branches being refit to match this model. Lloyds is yet to release the full list of branches affected.  They will be counter-less - and staff will carry tablet computers to help customers.  There will also be video links for customers to talk to mortgage advisers, but for complex transactions they will have to visit a bigger branch.  A micro trial already exists at a Lloyds Bank branch in Paternoster Square, London, which uses less than 1,000 square feet of space.  Lloyds said under the reform there will be just one flagship branch per brand.  The first, a Lloyds branch, will open in the centre of Manchester this summer. That will be followed by a flagship Halifax branch in central London.  It also confirmed plans to open a fleet of \\'mobile\\' branches across the Lloyds Bank and Bank of Scotland networks with 20 new branches being introduced by the end of the year.  This will start with branches in South Wales, Devon and Gloucestershire over the new few weeks.  In the past two years, HSBC, RBS, Barclays and Lloyds have collectively shut down more than 1,046 banks as consumers turn to \"digital banking\".  Defending its decision, the group said the changes are part of plans to \"to ensure we give our customers the choice they are looking for\".  A spokesperson for Lloyds Banking Group told Mirror Money: \"Branches are a vital part of our strategy, and we\\'re investing in our network to make sure it\\'s right for the future.  \"We\\'re transforming branches, responding to customers and giving them choice, including new flagship branches in city centre locations, and introducing some smaller micro-formats alongside our community and mobile branches.\"',\n",

Tyler Mears looks at how to find out  HEN people die they leave behind everything they owned - whether that's money, property, businesses or cars.  WThis becomes known as the person's estate. This can range from a few thousand pounds to potentially millions.  But what happens to these estates when someone dies without leaving a will? If someone dies without leaving a valid or effective will (intestate) their closest living relatives are entitled to the estate.  If no entitled blood relatives come forward to make a claim in 12 years, the money will automatically be passed to the state.  ¦ How to check if you're an heir You can check if any of your family members have died and left a valuable estate to which you may be entitled online.  A list of unclaimed estates is held by the Treasury Solicitor.  Among other things, the Treasury Solicitor's Department collects, manages and disposes of bona vacantia (ownerless property and other assets) in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.  This includes the estates of people who die intestate and with no entitled relatives.  The Division publishes a list of unclaimed estates which have been recently referred, but not yet administered, and historic cases which have been administered but not yet been claimed within the time limits for doing so.  The list is updated every working day. ¦ How to make a claim Check your entitlement. If someone dies without leaving a valid or effective will the following are entitled to the estate in the order shown below: Husband, wife or civil partner; children; grandchildren; great grandchildren and so on; mother or father; brothers or sisters who share both the same mother and father, or their children (nieces and nephews); half brothers or sisters or their children (nieces and nephews of the half blood or their children); uncles and aunts or their children (first cousins or their descendants); half uncles and aunts or their children (first cousins of the half blood or their children).  If you are, for example, a first cousin of the deceased, you would only be entitled to share in the estate if there are no relatives above you in the order of entitlement, for example, a niece or nephew.  ¦ Make a claim If an entitled relative survived the deceased but has since died, that relative's personal representative (the person legally entitled to deal with their estate) must make a claim to the deceased person's estate.  If you believe you are entitled to claim an estate, send a family tree which shows how you are related to the person who has died, and include the dates of birth, marriage and death of all those on the tree.  If it appears that you may be entitled to claim the estate, you will then be asked to supply documentary evidence that proves your entitlement.

Less stuff gives the impression of more space and allows buyers to imagine their own belongings in your home.  It\\'s relatively easy to get rid of excess sofas, chairs, bicycles and other big stuff. But sweating the small stuff can be a whole lot more difficult.  Don\\'t be fooled that you can hide the clutter. Open home viewers open cupboards and drawers to imagine where their own stuff would go. Jam-packed drawers give the impression of no space. And that\\'s a real no-no.  \"Buyers like storage room,\" says Martin Cooper, managing director of Harcourts Cooper & Co on the North Shore. \"So let them see you have plenty of room by not having it all full.\"  Declutter your drawers, shelves, wardrobes, linen cupboards, kitchen surfaces, garages, and anywhere else you can to stop even the slightest impersonation of a hoarder. The more you can get rid of, the easier and cheaper your move will be. Don\\'t expect to do this all in one weekend. Give yourself a few months if you can and do a bit every night.  Start with your wardrobe. That\\'s an area where many Kiwis have clutter blindness.  \"When you wear an item and return it to your wardrobe, turn the hanger around the other way,\" Daniel Coulson, national residential manager at Bayleys says. \"After a couple of weeks of this, you will pretty quickly see what items you can do without.\"  Cooper\\'s cure is for vendors to interview every item in their wardrobe. \"If you have not worn it for a year get rid of it. Set a goal number like 20 items get fired today.\"  Do the same with pantry, linen cupboard, kitchen cabinets and anywhere else you\\'re hoarding excess stuff, says Cooper.  Other tips to declutter include:  ?Give one item away a day or at least list it on Trade Me if it\\'s worth something and you couldn\\'t otherwise part with it. That\\'s 90 fewer things in your house after three months.  ?Fill pink bags. Use a five-minute slot to fill a pink charity bag or bin liner. Don\\'t sit down until it\\'s stuffed full with items to donate to charity. Then take that bag to the Op Shop quickly before you change your mind. Or fill the bag with items that you can sell in one bulk lot on Trade Me.  ?Take the 12-12-12 challenge. Find 12 items to donate, 12 to throw away or recycle and 12 to return to relocate. Another such numbers challenge is the 1-2-3. Every time you decide what to do with one item, pick up number two and then three and deal with that as well.  ?Ask yourself , \"Do I really need this\"? Or use other psychological approaches such as \"If I had to buy this today would I be willing to pay money for it?\"',\n",

See Also: 5 Things You Should Never Put In an E-mail  What if you\\'re writing to a general in-box that starts with \"info@\" or the like, rather than to a specific person? \"To Whom It May Concern\" makes for a cold greeting, even to a stranger, says Gottsman. Instead, acknowledge that there\\'s a human on the other end and go with \"\\'Dear Hiring Manager\" or \"To the Customer Service Team.\"  I was looped into a group e-mail discussion on a topic that\\'s not my expertise. Should I respond? If your e-mail address appears in the \"To\" line, yes, says Rosanne Thomas, president of Protocol Advisors, an etiquette consultancy. If you\\'re included in the \"cc:\" box or as part of a large preset e-mail group, you\\'re usually off the hook, and recipients might even appreciate your keeping the thread uncluttered. One exception: If the request comes from a superior or client, send a short, private note back so he or she doesn\\'t think you are being unresponsive.  Can I send a formal sympathy or thank-you note by e-mail rather than regular mail? Write condolence cards by hand: This personal touch is more comforting and meaningful than an e-mail and better conveys the gravity of the loss. Plus, the recipient might appreciate being able to pull out the card to reread it in the future. A thank-you message via e-mail is often sufficient, especially when you want to thank someone quickly. But in cases in which someone has done you a special favor, such as helping you out in an emergency or nominating you for an award, send a handwritten letter.  One situation in which it pays to do both: following a job interview. Interviewers expect to hear from you within 24 hours, says Thomas, so send a brief thank-you e-mail right after the interview that also reaffirms your interest. Immediately follow up with a written note repeating your thanks and reminding the interviewer of the assets you can bring to the job.  Copyright 2017 The Kiplinger Washington Editors',\n",
       " 'S2 MP backs fight for fair pensions A PETITION has been presented to the House of Commons calling on the Government to help women who have taken the burden of the rise in pension age.  Sir Bill Cash presented the petition, which had been signed by many residents of his constituency last week.  The petition asked the Government to make a fair transitional arrangements for all women born in the 1950s (on or after 6 April 1951) who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase to the State Pension Age.  The petition said: \"That as a result of the way in which the 1995 Pension Act and the 2011 Pension Act were implemented, women born (on or after April 6, 1951, have unfairly borne the burden of the increases to the State Pension Age; further that hundreds of thousands of women have had significant changes imposed on them with little or no personal notice; further that implementation took place faster than promised; further that this gave no time to make alternative pension plans; and further that retirement plans have been shattered with devastating consequences. The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to make fair transitional arrangements for all women born in the 1950s (on or after April 6, 1951), who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase to the State pension Age.\"  Women from Leek and the Staffordshire Moorlands recently joined a national demonstration in London over the way the new pension age has been brought in by the Government.  Women Against State Pension Inequality (WASPI) is leading a campaign to contest the way the rise in pensionable age has been implemented, and is asking for transitional payments to be made to those women affected.  Changes to the female state pension age of 60 were first put forward in 1995 to bring women in line with men, starting in 2010.  This would gradually rise in stages to 65, the \\'normal\\' male retirement age, by 2020.  Then in 2011 the Coalition Government decided to quicken the pace of the rise so that a woman\\'s state pension age would be 65 by November 2018. Then there would be a further rise to 66 over the following two years. Last December members of Staffordshire Moorlands District Council voted to support calls urging the Government to reconsider changes to the state pension paid to women born after April 6, 1951.  One of the Moorlands campaigners, Valerie McGrath, who helps run the Staffordshire Moorlands branch, said: \"We welcome the petition presented by Sir Bill Cash. We have also joined 7,000 women for the national demonstration in London.  \"Members of the group have also attended the Annual General Meeting of Unison at Hartshill, where we were presented with a £200 donation for our fight.  \"The group are also going to get some business cards printed and attend events in Leek as we still believe that some women do not realise that they will not get their pension at 60.\"',\n",
       " 'Ontario urging Ottawa to change tax rules in bid to curb real estate speculation TORONTO - Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa is urging Ottawa to address speculative investing in the country\\'s housing markets by changing how such profits are taxed.  Currently, a capital gains tax is charged on 50 per cent of the profits on the sale of a home unless the property qualifies for a principal residence exemption.  In a letter to federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau dated Friday, Sousa says that boosting the taxable amount above 50 per cent could reduce the incentive for people to purchase homes on speculation.  Morneau is set to release his latest budget on Wednesday amid speculation that the Liberals may increase the capital gains tax.  Jack Mintz, a tax policy expert at the University of Calgary, says that doing so could harm innovation by discouraging people from making risky investments.  Mintz also noted that increasing the capital gains tax charged on homes may not have a big impact on speculative activity.  \"Will it stop speculation? I\\'m not sure,\" says Mintz. \"It may not entirely change it.\"  Speculative investing in the real estate market - buying a home in the hope of turning a profit rather than to live in - is believed to be one of the culprits behind soaring house prices in certain markets, particularly in Toronto, Vancouver and their surrounding areas.  A TD Bank report published Monday says that the combination of strong demand for homes and the lack of available supply have created the \"perfect eco-climate\" for speculators.  \"The continued escalation in home prices may have generated a greater tendency towards flipping homes for a profit,\" the report by TD economists Beata Caranci, Diana Petramala and Katherine Judge says.  Sousa says curbing speculative real estate purchases could help address dwindling housing affordability so that first-time buyers are able to get into the market, while also generating tax revenue to put towards other housing affordability initiatives.  \"My primary focus is to address the concerns of middle-class Canadians who are worried about buying their first home,\" Sousa says in his letter to Morneau.  \"Additionally, it is important that the housing market remains stable, meaning that borrowers and lenders are resilient and able to withstand economic shocks.\"  Sousa has also floated the idea of implementing a tax on foreign buyers, similar to the one that the B.C. government introduced in Vancouver last summer, in a bid to cool the red-hot real estate market in Canada\\'s largest city.  However, the Toronto Real Estate Board opposes the idea, saying it would do little to curb rising home prices.  When asked Monday if the foreign buyer tax was still on the table, Sousa emphasized that the government is considering a myriad of possible options to tackle housing affordability.  \"We are looking at a number of opportunities, a number of options,\" Sousa said.  -With files from Andy Blatchford in Ottawa and Allison Jones in Toronto.

       " 'Trump Reverses Obama-Era Protections on Student Debt According to a Tuesday analysis from the Consumer Federation of America (CFA), millions of Americans have fallen behind on their student loans. The data, obtained from the U.S. Department of Education, reveals 42.4 million people in the U.S. owed $1.3 trillion in federal student loans by the end of 2016. Since 2013, the average amount owed per borrower increased by 17 percent.  Back in 2015, the Obama administration issued a memo that prevented debt collectors from charging high interest rates on overdue student loans. So long as the borrower entered the government\\'s loan-rehabilitation program within 60 days of defaulting, agencies of the old, bank-based Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP) were forbidden from charging up to 16 percent of personal and accrued interest. Still, some lawmakers argue that debt collectors continue to impose these fees, despite the Obama regulations.  As part of an ongoing legal case, the U.S. District Court gave the Trump administration until March 16 to decide whether to uphold the Obama-era guidelines.  Senator Elizabeth Warren and Representative Suzanne Bonamici, both Democrats, penned a letter Monday asking Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos to uphold the previous memo. \"We urge the [Department of Education] to stand by its previous guidance and give borrowers in default a chance to rehabilitate their loans and successfully repay their debt without being charged massive collection fees,\" the letter reads.  This request was short-lived. The Department of Education revoked the Obama guidelines on Thursday and instructed guarantee agencies (companies that issue government-backed student loans) to collect on defaulted debt.  As MarketWatchpoints out, a relatively small share of borrowers will be impacted by the new regulations. Starting in 2010, all new federal student loans were issued by the Department of Education, which doesn\\'t charge collection fees to borrowers who quickly agree to make good on their defaults. As a result, students who have taken out federal loans in the last few years need not worry about an increase in fees.  But those who received loans from the FFELP-which discontinued new loans in 2010-have cause for concern. The Washington Postreports that nearly half of America\\'s outstanding debt in default comes from this bank-based federal lending program, while Tuesday\\'s CFA analysis finds that 16 million Americans are liable for bank-based federal student loans.  Rohit Chopra, a senior fellow at CFA, told The Post the new policy \"will do nothing to stop the tidal wave of defaults that is sweeping across the nation.\" In fact, he fears that the roll back of the Obama memo \"just adds insult to injury.\"  One of the main criticisms from the Trump administration, as stated Thursday in a \"dear colleague\" letter, was that the Obama memo lacked public input. Only time will tell what the public has to say about the new administration guidelines.Read Trump Reverses Obama-Era Protections on Student Debt  on theatlantic.com',\n",
       " 'Financial Post Oilpatch losses to top $1B in 2017: study; \\'Survival Mode\\' The Canadian oilpatch is expected to collectively bleed more than $1 billion from its balance sheets in 2017, a sign that oil producers continue to struggle despite optimism that crude prices will gradually rise through the year.  A report released Monday by the Conference Board of Canada expects oil companies to remain, in total, in the red until the fourth quarter of 2017. Total losses are expected to reach $1.1 billion for the year.  Losses reached their peak in the first quarter of 2016 when prices had plummeted, leading to a collective loss of $11 billion.  The Conference Board report forecasts a gradual return to past profitability, with companies raking in a total of $13 billion in profits by 2021. That figure is roughly equal to 2010 levels.  \"In summary, as Canada\\'s crude extraction industry will remain in survival mode from a financial perspective in the near term, investment levels will remain relatively low,\" the report said.  Capital investment in the sector is also expected to remain low, after reaching $27 billion in 2016 - down 43 per cent from the 2014 peak of $62 billion.  The report serves as a reminder that oil companies remain in a defensive financial position despite substantially lowering their operating and capital costs in recent years.  It said \"investment levels are not anticipated to reach previously observed peaks any time soon\" as capital flows toward nimbler oil plays with faster return cycles.  \"Following three consecutive years of oversupply, global crude oil markets are finally moving back into balance. Global demand is expected to increase in coming years, suggesting that prices will continue the upward trajectory that began late last summer,\" said Carlos Murillo, economist at the board. \"Despite recent positive developments, however, we do not expect the industry\\'s bottom line to return to positive territory until the fourth quarter of this year given that it started from such a weak position.\"  Oil prices have risen from their 2016 lows and have continued to hover around the US$50 level. However, rapidly growing output from U.S. shale basins threatens to keep prices depressed, analysts say, and last week higher-than-expected storage levels of American crude sent prices on their longest tumble since late 2016.  U.S. crude settled down 0.2 per cent at US$48.40 a barrel.  Like other forecasts, the Conference Board\\'s report expects oilsands output to grow as expansion projects come online. Investment in the oilsands is expected to grow by 11 per cent, partly due to increased maintenance and repair costs. Conventional crude producers are expected to see investments increase at a rate of two per cent annually.  Global demand for oil, meanwhile, is expected to grow. The report estimates demand will increase by two per cent per year over the next few years, higher than the 1.3-per-cent growth estimates from the International Energy Agency forecast.  jsnyder@postmedia.com',\n",

Last-minute IRA contributions before filing your taxes  IRA investors have until the end of the tax season to make last-minute contributions and claim the tax deductions on their 2016 return, according to this Yahoo Finance article. Clients should max out the contributions to reduce their taxable income, says one adviser.  \"If you have a non-working spouse, you can also make a contribution on their behalf which can double the amount of contributions for your family,\" the adviser told Yahoo. \"Spousal contributions can be made as long as you file a joint tax return and have income greater than both IRA contributions.\"  Retirees, maximize your income from dividends  Despite stock market swings, dividend growth remains a good source of income, even for retirement investors, according to this article on Kiplinger. The challenge is to find the right dividend stocks or funds. Those that offer steady dividend growth are particularly good candidates, the Kiplinger\\'s article suggested. Clients should then hone in on the stocks with low expense ratios to maximize their dividend income.  Avoid these mistakes with discretionary income in retirement  Contrary to what some experts say, investing assets earmarked for discretionary expenses in risky investments such as stocks may not be a smart move, according to this article on MarketWatch. That is because those discretionary expenses could turn out to be a necessity after your clients retire. Advisers recommend that clients take a conservative approach, such as putting funds in a low expense, no-load mutual fund that holds short-term government bonds.  The right way to get the retirement income you need  Buying an immediate annuity can be a good strategy to secure guaranteed income in retirement, but it also means that clients have to give up access to their money for good, according to CNNMoney.  To decide whether an immediate annuity suits their retirement needs, clients should estimate their expenses in retirement and account for Social Security benefits, plus income from other sources. Getting an annuity is recommended if their retirement income is not enough to cover these expenses, as its guaranteed income will enable them to feel more secure about their golden years.  Q&A: Same-sex union, foreign residency don\\'t preclude getting Social Security  A 65-year-old American retiree who enters into a same-sex union in a country that recognizes gay marriage can have his or her significant other apply for Social Security spousal benefits once they meet the one-year requirement, according to this article on USA Today. The spouse qualifies for the benefits even if they are a foreigner who has never worked in the U.S. \"As a spouse, (your) partner will be eligible for a benefit equal to 50% of (your) gross monthly amount. If (you) were to pass away, then the payment amount would jump up to 100% of what (you were) collecting,\" an expert says.',\n",

       " 'Business The piper must be paid Student debt no t so easily forgiven Owing to a serious misconception, almost half of college students recently polled believe they won\\'t be saddled with student loans soon after graduation.  According to a survey of 500 current college students conducted by LendEDU, a private firm that connects students and their families with student loans and loan refinancing, 49.8 percent believe they would be able to receive federal forgiveness on their student loans after graduation.  This belief is hardly justified, given the limited circumstances in which these loans can actually be forgiven.  The US Department of Education says that federal direct student loan borrowers can get off the hook if they enter public service jobs for a specified period of time, agree to teach in an underserved area, die or become permanently disabled, or if the school they attended shuts down while they are enrolled or within 120 days after they leave.  \"The biggest exemption is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and very few students go into public service,\" said Nate Matherson, who co-founded LendEDU in 2014.  \"With maybe 14 percent of the American workforce in a public service job, the actual numbers of those who may qualify for student loan forgiveness or discharge is maybe below 10 percent.  \"The fact that many students do not understand this means that they may be significantly underestimating the cost of financing a college education,\" he added.  Many students polled said they would rely on financial aid to make up the difference in reduced debt load. So while 90 percent knew of FASFA (Free Application for Federal Student Aid), 84 percent did not know the correct filing deadline for the application.  Mark Stephens is financial aid director at Pace University, where the \"sticker price\" annual tuition is $42,354 for the 2017-18 academic year, a figure that he says is on the average \"about 50 percent discounted\" through a combination of gift scholarships, other freebies like Pell Grants, and loans.  Given the high degree of dependence today\\'s students have on this aid, he said he and other financial aid professionals are aware of the need to make sure students and their families understand how the process works.  He said Pace conducts 25 or 30 financial aid workshops in high schools each year as well as online tutorials.  \"It\\'s not very realistic at all to expect loan forgiveness,\" he said. \"We try to tell students to understand your loan and manage your spending.\"  \"Generally students are pretty well aware about financial aid by the time they come,\" says MJ Knoll-Finn, vice president for enrollment management at NYU, where 2017-2018 tuition and fees before financial aid come to $49,062. \"There\\'s a lot of information out there for students.\"  \"We consider college an investment,\" Knoll-Finn said. \"We want them to go into this with their eyes open.

The WSJ Dollar Index, measuring the U.S. currency against 16 others, fell 0.3% to 91.02. The index had been up as much as 0.1% earlier in the day.  Minutes from the Jan.31-Feb.1 meeting showed officials believed it might be appropriate to lift U.S. interest-rates \"fairly soon.\" Several policy makers also raised the possibility of moving more aggressively than expected should inflation surge and the unemployment rate fall too much.  But the minutes didn\\'t offer a clear sign about when the Fed will next raise rates, disappointing some investors.  \"What would have helped the dollar was a strong indication of a March rate-increase, and they\\'re not conveying that,\" said Vassili Serebriakov, a currency strategist at Crédit Agricole.  Mr. Serebriakov said the minutes also didn\\'t offer much new information on the Fed\\'s plans for shrinking its $4.5 trillion portfolio, a move that analysts say could lead to a stronger dollar.  Fed officials also raised concerns during the meeting about how the strong dollar could weigh on inflation and the uncertainty surrounding President Donald Trump\\'s fiscal stimulus proposals.  Federal-funds futures, used by investors to bet on the Fed\\'s interest-rate policy, showed a 18% chance that the Fed will raise rates at its next meeting in March, according to data from CME Group. Investors assign a 50% chance that the Fed raises rates by May.  Higher rates typically support the dollar by making U.S. assets more attractive to yield-seeking investors.  Since the meeting, several Fed officials have sounded optimistic that interest-rates will rise this year, citing the strength of the labor market and firming inflation.  Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said Tuesday, \"I would not take March off the table.\" Dallas Fed chief Robert Kaplan said earlier this month that the central bank should move \"sooner rather than later.\"  In other currencies, the euro recovered 0.3% against the dollar to $1.0564.

The spread between French and German 10-year government-bond yields widened to 0.74 percentage point on Friday from 0.66 percentage point Thursday. French bonds are now trading in the same direction as those of the southern European countries, whose debt was hit hardest by the euro sovereign-debt crisis.

       " 'Legislation Introduced to Expand Social Security; Sen. Sanders, Bernard (I - VT) News Release WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced legislation Thursday to expand Social Security benefits and strengthen the retirement program for generations to come. Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) introduced a companion bill in the House.  \"It is time to expand Social Security, not cut it,\" Sanders told Social Security Works, The Alliance for Retired Americans and other organizations at a meeting on Capitol Hill.  The legislation would ensure that Social Security could pay every benefit owed to every eligible American for the next 61 years, according to a new analysis Thursday by the retirement system\\'s chief actuary.  \"Anyone who tells you Social Security is going broke is lying,\" Sanders said. \"We can increase Social Security benefits for millions of Americans and extend the life of Social Security if we have the political will to tell the wealthiest Americans to pay the same rate as everyone else.\"  The bills would increase benefits by about $1,300 a year for seniors now making less than $16,000 annually. \"At a time when more than half of older Americans over the age of 55 have no retirement savings, our job is to expand Social Security to make sure that every American can retire with the dignity and the respect that they have earned and deserve,\" Sanders said.  The legislation also would make the wealthiest Americans - those with incomes of more than $250,000 a year - pay the same rate into the retirement system as everyone else already pays. Current law now caps the amount of income subject to payroll taxes $127,200. Under the proposal, only the top 1.6 percent of wage earners would pay more under the proposal, according to the Center for Economic Policy Research.  Strengthening and expanding Social Security enjoys widespread support: 72 percent of Americans, including 51 percent of Republicans, \"support increasing - not cutting - Social Security benefits by asking millionaires and billionaires to pay more into the system,\" according to an October 2016 survey by Public Policy Polling,  \"This is not a radical idea. In fact, it is supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike,\" Sanders said.  The measure also would increase cost-of-living adjustments by more accurately measuring the spending patterns of seniors. Under current law, the consumer price index used to calculate annual benefit adjustments does not accurately reflect how inflation in health care costs and prescription drug prices impact seniors. Despite the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, seniors and disabled veterans received no cost-of-living-adjustment for three out of the last six years. Under the legislation, a typical Social Security recipient would see a $43 per month increase at age 80 and a $73 a month increase at age 90.

       " \"News Pensioner, 71, could be forced to sell his home after being ordered to repay the £37,000 he claimed in benefits while secretly working on a £35-a-week paper round * Roy Taylor received benefits for years on basis he was medically unfit to work  * But he was videoed doing an early morning paper round by DWP after a tip-off  * He was convicted of dishonestly claiming pension credits and disability benefits  * He will have to sell off half-share in house in Weston-super-Mare to pay off debt  A pensioner faces having to sell his home after he claimed more than £37,000 in benefits while secretly working - on a £35-a-week paper round.  Roy Taylor, 71, of Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, had received benefits for years on the basis that he was medically unfit to work.  But he was videoed doing an early morning paper round by Department for Work and Pensions investigators, following a tip-off.  He was convicted of dishonestly claiming pension credits and disability benefits and was hit with a confiscation order to hand back the money.  Taylor told London's Appeal Court he will have to sell off his half-share in a house in Weston-super-Mare to pay off the debt.  The court heard he had been earning £35 a week delivering papers, despite being a long-term benefit claimant.  Taylor was caught on film after surveillance was taken over 11 separate days between April and May 2012.  He pleaded guilty to making a dishonest representation to obtain benefits and failing to notify a change of circumstances at Bristol Crown Court.  Taylor was handed a seven-month suspended sentence in May 2013.  Later the same year, however, he was hit with a £37,201.79 confiscation order, to claw back the money he was overpaid.  Lord Justice Hamblen, at the Criminal Appeal Court, heard his bid to get that order overturned.  The court heard Taylor will have to sell the house he jointly owns with his wife in Weston-super-Mare in order to pay off his debt.  Taylor had claimed his mother-in-law put up the bulk of the money to buy the house - and denied owning half of it.  But the judge, sitting with Mr Justice William Davis and Sir David Maddison, dismissed his appeal.  Lord Justice Hamblen said that Land Registry records showed Taylor and his wife were joint owners of the property, and made no mention of the mother-in-law having any interest.  An application for permission to appeal against his convictions was also refused.  A DWP spokesman said: 'Only a small minority of people try to cheat the benefits system, but cases like this show how we are rooting out those who are stealing taxpayers' money and diverting it away from the people who really need it.  'People convicted of fraud shouldn't be able to benefit from their crimes, so we will always try to get back the money they stole.'\",\n",
       " 'New Zealanders at risk of sexually transmitted debt Love might be in the air, but research from credit score company CreditSimple.co.nz shows it doesn\\'t necessarily translate to the bank account. A recent survey shows almost 28 per cent of New Zealanders have been burnt financially by a partner, sparking warnings this Valentine\\'s Day to tread carefully when it comes to dating, finances and maintaining credit health. Women bear the brunt of this, making up nearly 64 per cent of those adversely affected.  The most common examples include New Zealanders who racked up secret credit card debt behind their partner\\'s back, partners who refused to pay their share of debt after a relationship ended, partners who said they were paying bills but weren\\'t, and even those who forged their partner\\'s signature on loan documents. For many, the financial woes are discovered too late, leaving their credit scores in tatters and making it almost impossible to get a loan or mortgage until they\\'ve built their credit score up again.  Credit Simple New Zealand boss Hazel Phillips says it\\'s important New Zealanders keep an eye on their credit scores and work quickly to repair any damage.  \"Many people don\\'t bother checking their credit health until they need to apply for a loan or credit card, then it comes as a shock when there\\'s a default on their file and the loan is denied,\" Ms Phillips said.  \"The number of Kiwis uncovering secret debt or finding out joint bills in their name haven\\'t been paid is surprisingly high. Knowing your credit score, and checking it regularly, is the best way to know if you\\'ve contracted sexually transmitted debt, and work to repair it.\"  Research also suggests honesty isn\\'t always the best policy when it comes to love and finances either. Almost 18 per cent of New Zealanders admit to having money or debt their partner isn\\'t aware of. Of these people, women lie the most often about finances at nearly 64 per cent compared with men at 36 per cent. The majority of people keeping finances secret from their partner were hiding private bank accounts or cash reserves (67.3 per cent), while almost 18 per cent had secret debt.  However, those funds and debt might not be as well-hidden as Kiwis think. Nearly 12 per cent of people suspect their partner of hiding finances from them. Sixty-five per cent think this is a hidden bank account or savings, and nearly 10 per cent think their partner has hidden debt.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, people who have secret accounts are more likely to argue about finances with their partner. More than 44 per cent of people with hidden finances admit to arguing about money, yet of those with no hidden finances just under 30 per cent argue about money.

       " 'Ecology Research - Ecology and Society; Findings from University of Leeds Yields New Findings on Ecology and Society (Flow and rent-based opportunity costs of water ecosystem service provision in a complex farming system) 2017 FEB 17 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Ecology, Environment & Conservation -- Current study results on Ecology Research - Ecology and Society have been published. According to news originating from Leeds, United Kingdom, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Unsustainable land uses present many challenges for securing ecosystem service provision. It is also difficult to estimate the cost of a transition to more sustainable land-management practices for individual landholders.\"  Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from the University of Leeds, \"The main cost to landholders is the opportunity costs, the income foregone when changing land use for continued or enhanced ecosystem service provision. Thus accurate estimation of opportunity costs and understanding their distribution are crucial starting points for determining the economic viability and design of any payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme. We compare two opportunity cost approaches and examine the distribution of these costs for improving drinking water quality in a complex farming system in a Honduran forest catchment. Data for both approaches was collected through a survey applied to upstream catchment landholders. Our results indicate that the direct flow approach and the proxy rent approach provide comparable and consistent opportunity cost estimates. The mean net flow return ha(-1) was US$1410, but this estimate was skewed, mainly by exceptionally high coffee returns and negative returns of land uses making a loss. This estimate would imply spending over US$ 2 million per annum for water conservation, but a revised estimate comes to US$ 257,057 per annum. Opportunity costs were found to vary according to differences in land use and landholder characteristics. High value cash crops upholding the local economy, such as coffee, entail much higher opportunity costs than for example cattle grazing. These results suggest that discriminate PES payments, that vary according to opportunity costs and thus discriminate between land uses and landholders, are essential.\"  According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Water quality at our case study site could be managed sustainably by a scheme focusing on high-impact land uses with lower opportunity costs and closer to water sources.\"  For more information on this research see: Flow and rent-based opportunity costs of water ecosystem service provision in a complex farming system.

       " 'Regional Ongaonga residents face huge water costs Some Ongaonga residents struggling with water shortages in their bores and wells again this year are having to bite the bullet and spend thousands of dollars on new pumps to reach the lower water table.  Ian Franklin has lived in the village for three years, and had a 33m deep bore, a standard depth for most of the bores in the area operating with surface pumps, as when they were built this was sufficient to reach water.  He said he started having problems with his existing pump about two years ago, but on January 10 this year it stopped working completely.  After spending $1500 on investigations to see whether a submersible pump could be put in, it was discovered this would not work in his situation, so he forked out nearly $8000 for a jet pump, which works by pushing the water down one pipe, then forcing water up another pipe to which is pumped to the house.  Another resident, Shona Pye, a single mother who has lived in Ongaonga for 13 years, also had to find $4500 this year to pay for a submersible pump to be put in - this on top of $12,000 she spent on a bore to replace the existing well about eight years ago.  \"About 10 days ago that bore stopped working so in the last week I had to find the finance to get the submersible pump and it\\'s not finished yet.  \"I was told once I had the bore in I would have no further problems - finding this kind of money is not easy.\"  Both she and Mr Franklin found the situation hard to swallow when they saw irrigators in the area operating day and night.  \"I would like to see the irrigators limited as well and financial support given to residents having to buy extra equipment to cope,\" she said.  Mr Franklin said the situation was unacceptable considering how much irrigation was happening.  \"The experts have to come in and advise in light of the changing land use and changing weather patterns.  \"We have to be planning for the future - there needs to be a national discussion so the right decisions start being made - we have to get our acts together.\"  He said he made the decision to install his pump, as well as a 10,000 litre holding tank at the back of his property, for future owners of his house.  Long-time resident Bill Stevenson, who had a new pump installed this year, after being hit with water shortages in previous summers, said the problems began in Ongaonga in 2004 when the irrigators started operating. \"Where did the money go that was paid for those resource consents? Why can\\'t that money come back to the community to subsidise people who are having to buy water or put in new pumps?\"  Meanwhile, Hawke\\'s Bay Regional Council chairman Rex Graham could not be contacted for comment yesterday.',\n",
       " 'Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards, Inc. Make a Plan to Get Financially Fit 2017 FEB 11 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Obesity, Fitness & Wellness Week -- Year after year, getting healthy is a top New Year\\'s resolution for Americans, while saving more and spending less typically ranks lower on the list of priorities. Although many people will purchase gym memberships they may never use, taking steps to improve financial wellness is a resolution worth pursuing, and sticking to.  In the latest contribution to HYPERLINK \"http://www.letsmakeaplan.org/\" \\\\nLetsMakeaPlan.org, CFP Board Ambassadors - CFP(R) professionals who help to support CFP Board\\'s consumer advocacy and mission to benefit the public - offer the following tips to help you become and stay financially fit.  Create a budget: Creating a budget is a simple way to determine how best to spend your money. Start by reconciling last year\\'s expenditures and creating a list of necessary payments. Giving yourself a \"cheap month,\" such as spending $100 a week, can help define your needs. In addition, working with your spouse or partner can help identify a realistic budget and prevent overspending.  Put yourself first: Spending too much on adult children, parents and other family members can jeopardize your long-term financial situation. Having children live within a budget will force more careful spending while teaching a valuable lesson. For adult dependents, spend carefully; you can\\'t take care of others if you haven\\'t taken care of yourself.  Maximize benefits: Take full advantage of your existing benefits package, such as your 401(k) or retirement plan. For a 401(k), make sure to maximize your investment by matching your employer\\'s contribution. If you operate within individual funds, rebalance your 401(k) account periodically. Establishing a dollar cost averaging arrangement - investing set amounts at regular intervals regardless of the financial climate - for a new account, such as a Roth IRA or 529 plans, can also increase your savings.  Know yourself: Many people have chronic issues of overspending or mismanaging debt. Developing smart habits can improve your finances. If you fail to prudently spend with credit cards, cut them up. If you struggle to meet basic payments, round up to the nearest whole number on larger expenses. For example, if your car payment is $375, plan on spending $400 per month.  Big or small, everyone can take steps to improve their financial well-being. This year - while you\\'re working on your physical fitness - get you finances in shape by scheduling a meeting with a CERTIFIED FINANCIAL PLANNER(TM) professional who can help you take action to improve your financial situation.

       " 'Administration announces thirty-eight layoffs, reinstitution of student loans Dartmouth College ; Hanover, NH - news  By  Thirty-eight current employees and full student grants for families with incomes over $75,000 will be the first specific casualties in the College\\'s efforts to mitigate its $100-million budget shortfall, the College Office of Public Affairs announced in a press release Monday afternoon. The budget plan, which College President Jim Yong Kim submitted to the Board of Trustees over the weekend, also finds $25 million in savings in \"administrative reorganization and restructuring,\" the largest single segment of the proposed cutbacks.  Administrators will go forward with 38 layoffs beginning Tuesday, to be followed by a second round of layoffs that will reduce the workforce by a \"comparable number\" by the end of April, when the \"most intensive phase of the budget-reduction process\" draws to a close, according to the release. Thirty-three employees will be asked to work reduced hours, the release stated. While faculty will not be affected by the layoffs, jobs will be eliminated at \"all levels\" of employment and will affect both union and non-union employees.  The new budget will also require students with family incomes over $75,000 to take on loans of $2,500 to $5,500 each academic year, beginning with members of the Class of 2015, according to the release. Financial aid packages for current students will not be affected by the change in policy. Tuition, room and board and other fees will also be increased 4.6 percent, to $52,275 per year.  Benefits packages for College employees are also under review, although specific details of changes in benefits will not be announced until April, according to the release. Administrators expect to find $13 million in savings from projected changes to benefits and salaries.  In an e-mail message to the Dartmouth community, Kim announced that he will, along with acting Provost and Dean of the Faculty Carol Folt and Senior Vice President Steven Kadish, donate 10 percent of his salary, to be split between the Dartmouth College Fund and a separate hardship fund.  The budget also calls for the sale of College properties that are \"not core to the College\\'s mission or strategic plan\" as a way to raise revenue, according to the e-mail.  No athletic teams will be eliminated as part of the budget reduction measures, Kim, Kadish and Folt said in a press conference held Monday. The College will seek increased support from alumni as a way of funding athletic teams, they said.  College administrators will also work to consolidate and streamline administrative departments as a way to provide cost savings, the group said. The College administration has been as efficient as administrative structures at other academic institutions, they said, but the administration could be made more efficient by looking to businesses for leaner operational models.

       " 'Money Curious incident of the watchdog that didn\\'t bite I must confess I had never heard of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) until a few hours before I rang it last week to inquire about the former chancellor George Osborne and his good fortune in getting another well-paid job in the City.  Better still, from the point of view of Osborne\\'s constituents in Tatton, Cheshire, it will take him only one day a week to earn the reputed £200,000 annual salary for his services to the asset manager BlackRock, so the MP should have plenty of time left to deal with parliamentary stuff.  Acoba, as I\\'m sure you know, was set up to advise former ministers and senior civil servants who take up jobs in the private sector, lest they feel tempted to put their pay from the latter ahead of their obligations to the former. With the best will in the world, I told Acoba the BlackRock appointment raised serious questions about conflict of interest.  During his time at No 11, Osborne\\'s biggest reform by far was \"pensions freedom\". This removed the legal requirement to spend at least three-quarters of our retirement funds on an annuity - a guaranteed income for life - bought from an insurance firm, such as Standard Life.  Instead, savers can now do as we wish with our money, which, in most cases, means leaving the majority of it invested with fund managers - such as, er, BlackRock. As a result of the new rules, the insurers\\' £12bn-a-year annuities market has collapsed by more than 40% while inflows at fund managers - including BlackRock - have soared.  That\\'s why I asked Acoba to justify its decision to wave through Osborne\\'s new job. Specifically, I queried the letter in which the watchdog told him it \"was reassured by confirmation from your former department, Her Majesty\\'s Treasury, that there were no specific policy decisions from your time in office that would have specifically affected BlackRock and the permanent secretary had no concerns about you taking up this post\".  No specific policy decisions? No concerns? How about upending a £12bn-a-year market? What about the risk of pensioners\\' savings expiring before they do? After I put these points to Acoba, the committee admitted: \"We can see the point you are making.\"  Shortly after that, Acoba amended the letter (above) to emphasise that although his decisions had affected fund managers, none related to BlackRock specifically.  Given the billions of pounds involved, I don\\'t think tweaking the text cuts it. Nobody is a bigger fan than I of pensions freedom - I campaigned for it for many years - but this watchdog is fast asleep.  For the good of George Osborne\\'s reputation, and any hopes he may have of returning to the cabinet, Acoba must wake up and bare its fangs.ian.cowie@sunday-times.co.uk or follow on Twitter @iancowieRead a breakdown of Ian Cowie\\'s \\'forever\\' fund',\n",
       " 'UC Board of Regents approves 2.5 percent tuition increase University of California - Los Angeles; Los Angeles, CA - news  By  Students will have to pay $282 more in tuition after a vote by the governing board of the University of California.  The UC Board of Regents approved the 2.5 percent tuition increase, the first in six years, as part of the budget for next year at its bimonthly meeting Thursday at UC San Francisco. The budget also increases the student services fee by $54 and nonresident supplemental tuition by 5 percent, or $1,332.  This means that starting next year, students will have to pay $11,502 in tuition, $1,128 for the student services fee and other campus-specific fees.  Nathan Brostrom, UC executive vice president and chief financial officer, said the tuition increase would accommodate increased undergraduate enrollment, hire additional faculty and expand mental health services.  He added financial aid will cover the increase for two-thirds of students. However, that number also includes students who receive funds from the Middle Class Scholarship, which Gov. Jerry Brown proposed phasing out in his January budget proposal.  Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Student Regent Marcela Ramirez, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson and Regent John Perez voted against the increases.  Newsom said he laments the tuition increase and added he thinks it will give the state legislature an excuse to not increase funding for the UC.  \"While New York is moving towards free tuition, we are increasing the cost of education,\" he said. \"Even Tennessee, yes Tennessee, is working to decrease the cost of education.\"  Perez said he was disappointed more students did not attend the meeting to protest the tuition hike. UC Student Association President Ralph Washington Jr. gave a presentation to the regents on visiting campuses and state incarceration levels, but no protesters attended.  \"It is incumbent upon us as regents to be more student-centric and hear the real life impacts of our decisions,\" Perez said.  Several regents expressed concern about the governor\\'s proposal to phase out the Middle Class Scholarship, which provides scholarships to cover up to 40 percent of tuition and fees. Current students who receive the Middle Class Scholarship would be able to to renew scholarships, but no new ones would be awarded.  Regent Sherry Lansing said she thinks the University needs to work with the legislature to ensure that the Middle Class Scholarship continues.  \"We really need to be better with our messaging to the legislature,\" she said. \"The reality is tough for many families.\"  Other regents said they think there needs to be an effort to increase transparency on what the tuition increase revenue will fund.  Ramirez said she thinks the UC and campus administrators need to get more input from students on what each campus\\' funding priorities are.  \"Students have a genuine desire to be heard,\" she said. \"We want to work with you and have a say in how these funds are allocated.\"  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))',\n",
       " 'Wyoming Delegation Reintroduces Bill to Increase Water Storage in Southwestern Wyoming; Approves the Expansion of the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s Fontenelle Reservoir; Sen. Michael B. Enzi (R-WY) News Release Today, U.S. Senators John Barrasso and Mike Enzi and U.S. Representative Liz Cheney, all R-Wyo., reintroduced legislation to approve the expansion of water storage at the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s (BOR) Fontenelle Reservoir in Lincoln County, Wyoming.  \"After years of delay, this bill will help move the much needed Fontenelle Reservoir expansion project forward,\" said Barrasso. \"Expanding water storage will give our farmers, ranchers and communities a reliable supply of water in order to keep their livestock and crops healthy. More water storage capacity also provides an economic incentive for new businesses to grow and create jobs in southwest Wyoming.\"  \"Access to a good source of water in Wyoming doesn\\'t always come easy, but it\\'s vital to our livelihood,\" said Enzi. \"This legislation would allow for the expansion of the Fontenelle Reservoir to ensure Wyoming can finally take advantage of the project\\'s full potential. As the former mayor of a booming city, I know how important water storage projects like this are, both to meet today\\'s water needs and keep water supplies secure and flexible into the future.\"  \"Wyoming\\'s agricultural industry is crucial to our economy and our way of life. I am proud to introduce legislation with Senator Barrasso and Senator Enzi that will ensure more of the precious water coming from the Fontenelle Reservoir can be stored and used by our farmers, ranchers and local communities. This increase in active storage capacity will mean more water to our local communities which can lead to more economic growth and jobs. The reliable storage of our water is an ever-present infrastructure priority in Wyoming, an arid Western state,\" said Cheney.  Background:  The bill allows for the expansion of water storage at the Bureau of Reclamation\\'s (BOR) Fontenelle Reservoir in Lincoln County. This would be accomplished by completing the \"rip rap\" around the reservoir. \"Rip rap\" is a foundation or sustaining wall of stones or chunks of concrete connected together around the reservoir to prevent erosion.  The bill directs the State of Wyoming and the BOR to reach an agreement to allow Wyoming to complete the rip rap around the reservoir. The state of Wyoming would pay for the cost of completing this project. Wyoming would also have a right to the water stored in the reservoir if the reservoir is completed by building the rip rap.  Despite multiple requests by the state of Wyoming in 2011 and 2014, the Bureau of Reclamation has not completed the needed National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) compliance in order to move forward with the expansion of the Fontenelle Reservoir in Lincoln County.

The Mexican peso was the strongest currency of the day, rallying about 1.7% against the dollar.  Mr. Trump struck a populist tone in his inauguration speech, reiterating promises to build new infrastructure and bring jobs back to the U.S.  \"We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs,\" he said. \"Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.  The dollar oscillated during the 16-minute speech but ended lower. Some investors had hoped for more clarity on his tax reform and fiscal spending plans.  \"Markets are going to be very cautious moving forward and will be looking very closely at policy versus expectations,\" said Sireen Harajli a foreign-exchange strategist at Mizuho Bank. \"We need to see concrete policies going forward to support the strong dollar.\"  The dollar had soared to 14-year-highs after Mr. Trump was elected in November, amid hopes that his plans to boost fiscal stimulus, reform taxes and loosen regulation would propel U.S. growth and inflation higher.  But the dollar\\'s rally has lost steam since the start of the year amid uncertainty over Mr. Trump\\'s priorities. Comments from Mr. Trump indicating he would prefer a weaker dollar prompted a sharp selloff in the U.S. currency earlier this week.  Investors will be watching for action on key issues such as trade in the weeks ahead. Many investors fear that a focus on trade protectionism would dent the economic benefits of policies such as infrastructure spending.  For now, weakness in the dollar is supporting the battered Mexican peso, said Ms. Harajli. The Mexican currency had plunged to record lows since the November election as investors worried about how Mr. Trump\\'s plans to renegotiate key trade deals will impact the Mexican peso. Despite Friday\\'s rebound, trading in the peso is likely to remain volatile until \"we get more concrete policy moves,\" said Ms. Harajli.  Other emerging-market currencies were mixed. The dollar fell 1.5% against the Turkish lira, which also plumbed all-time lows after the election, but rose 0.2% against the South African rand.  The greenback was down 0.1% against the Chinese yuan in offshore trading after mixed economic data. Data showed China notched a 6.7% gain in economic growth last year-the weakest rate in a generation-despite a surge of easy credit and state spending. Fourth-quarter GDP growth came in at 6.8%, slightly above economists\\' expectations.  Write to Chelsey Dulaney at Chelsey.Dulaney@wsj.com',\n",
       " 'What baby boomers need to know about RMDs Our daily roundup of retirement news your clients may be thinking about.  What baby boomers need to know about required minimum distributions  The oldest baby boomers will turn 70 1/2 this year, which means they will have to start taking required minimum distributions from their 401(k) plans and IRAs, according to this article on Forbes. IRA investors who turn 70 before June 30 are considered to have turned 70 1/2 before Dec. 31 and should draw their first RMD by April 18, 2018. Those with assets in 401(k) plans and other qualified retirement accounts should check their plan documents to determine when they should start taking their RMD.  Qualifying for the retirement savers\\' tax credit  Retirees who receive a small income from a part-time job are entitled to a retirement savers\\' tax credit for contributing to a Roth IRA, according to this article on Kiplinger. The tax break is based on their adjusted gross income and the amount of savings that they put into the account. For example, the retirement savers\\' tax credit last year would be 10% of the contributions for joint filers with an AGI between $40,001 and $61,500, and single filers whose AGI is between $20,001 and $30,750.  After retirement, clients may find a \\'second career\\' as a volunteer  Some seniors find meaning and purpose in life after leaving the workforce for good by helping others through volunteering.

An expert with the Transamerica Center for Retirement Studies offers a five-step strategy to help develop a backup to prepare for unexpected retirement. The strategy includes updating their professional skills and personal network, keeping a financial plan, reviewing their insurance policy, sharing their plans with trusted family members and staying healthy.  Just retired and inheriting $1 million: Is there a downside?  A new retiree who just received an inheritance is advised to consider their overall goals and financial resources to ensure that their nest egg will last through retirement, in this article on Money. Hiring an advisor, possibly a certified financial planner, is recommended, as the expert has the expertise to provide guidance on developing a more sustainable retirement plan. The client, however, should be wary of any financial product that the adviser offers, as well as other those who may take advantage of their fortune. \"This is tantamount to winning the lottery, when cousins come out of the woodwork, and children want cars,\" says an expert.',\n",
       " 'Money We planned a dream honeymoon, but Thomson turned it into a nightmare First our flight to Mexico was delayed, then our resort was ridiculously busy. Now Thomson won\\'t acknowledge our complaint  Last March we flew from Gatwick to Cancún in Mexico for a 10-day honeymoon (booked with Thomson at a cost of £5,200) for which we had saved hard. Close to our destination we were told the plane was running out of fuel and could not wait around for the airport\\'s broken radar to be fixed. We were diverted 100 miles to Mérida airport.  For five hours we sat on the runway while the pilot gave unhelpful updates. My husband, who is diabetic and which was made clear on the booking, had no water or food as there was none left. Despite ringing the call button nobody came, and all we were told was that the airport would not refuel us because Thomson had no contract with it.  We finally took off for Cancún, where our honeymoon went further downhill. The five-star Moon Palace resort was wonderful for three days until the masses arrived, when we had to queue for almost everything. No sunbeds unless we got up at 4am, no breakfast unless we ate at 10.30am when there was little left. There were long queues for dinner every night. We complained upon our return and have tried unsuccessfully to get a response from Thomson. Any help would be appreciated. KA, Horley, Surrey  A disappointing occurrence since you explicitly said you were booking your honeymoon. You also did the right thing in lodging a complaint as soon as you got home, as many package holiday companies have a deadline. By law you have the right to expect that the holiday matches the brochure or website description - and if not, under the terms of the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992, you would probably have a claim against Thomson.  Your complaint was made slightly more complicated by the fact it involved a flight delay (due to local radar problems and therefore not triggering automatic compensation under EU rules); while the second part related to the resort and what you considered to be services that were vastly inferior to a five-star hotel, boasting 14 restaurants and seven swimming pools.  After our intervention Thomson agreed to investigate (although it did not say why it failed to respond to your complaint), and you were contacted by a customer service representative who initially offered you £200, subsequently raised to £1,200 after further investigation. This was its final offer, which you accepted. Thomson said: \"We are sorry to hear of KA\\'s experience. We have been in direct contact and the situation has been successfully resolved.\" Hardly a dream honeymoon, however.  We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

PUT BUS PULLOUTS ON MONROE  My family quizzed a good friend of ours after retirement from the city as to his most important project to benefit Spokane during his tenure. He cited bus pullouts added during the Division Street upgrade to improve traffic flow.  If this upgrade on Division Street proved so valuable, why is it completely off the table for Monroe Street? The deletion of bus pullouts for the Monroe Street project has already tagged it as a \"told-you-so\" mistake.  RICH KAPELKE  SPOKANE  DRIVERS IGNORING RULES  I feel that many will attest to studying the driver\\'s manual to obtain their licenses, and afterward ignoring the basic rules of the road once they have license in hand. Many disregard the fact that they must give the pedestrian the right of way at a crosswalk. Many do not, as they seem to be in a hurry to get where they are going.  I see this a lot on East Trent in the area of the Union Gospel Mission. Just because a person might be homeless doesn\\'t mean they deserve less respect than if someone was trying to cross a street in any other neighborhood.

Funding such a company wouldn\\'t be hard as George Soros, the Clinton Foundation and, of course, the Hollywood \"intelligentsia\" have millions if not billions of dollars available that I am sure they would gladly use to fund such an endeavor. But this will never happen.  Why, you ask, would such a \"noble\" ideal not be brought to life by those who so fervently support it? The answer sadly is really basic and simple. Most of those who want to \"save the world\" want someone else to pay for creating their ideas. They just want to take the credit for having such \"noble\" intentions.  To be fair there are examples of individual idealists who use their own money to support and implement their own egalitarian ideals but these are usually at the local individual level not at the \"save-the-world\" national level. Perhaps the people that want to \"save the world\" should be more like these people. They might actually be able to accomplish something other than their personal glorification.

       " 'Prudential, Captrust win 401(k) lawsuit PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL and Captrust Financial Advisors have defeated allegations of fiduciary breach in a 401(k) lawsuit against the two companies and the employer sponsoring the retirement plan.  Connecticut District Court Judge Victor A. Bolden granted the defendants\\' requests to dismiss the class action lawsuit because the plaintiff, a plan participant, failed to state a claim, according to a decision filed Dec. 30 in Rosen v. Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co. et al.  Plaintiff Richard A. Rosen argued that Prudential, the record keeper for the $1.3 billion Ferguson Enterprises Inc. 401(k) plan, breached its fiduciary duties by engaging in self-dealing when servicing the plan.  Prudential allegedly did this through its receipt of revenue-sharing payments and by including its GoalMaker asset-allocation product in the plan, which supposedly steered participants into \"high-cost investment options to the benefit of Prudential,\" according to the court document.  Prudential argued it couldn\\'t be held liable for fiduciary breach under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 because it wasn\\'t acting as a fiduciary with respect to the alleged conduct, an argument Mr. Bolden supported.  \\'MAINSTREAM\\' DECISION  \"Prudential cannot be held liable under ERISA for breach of fiduciary duties or prohibited transactions with respect to its selection of investment options, determination of compensation, administration of the GoalMaker program, or alleged securities lending activities,\" the judge wrote. \"Plaintiffs have failed to plausibly plead any ERISA violations with respect to these activities, and any related claims are dismissed for failure to state a claim.\"  Laura Burke, a Prudential spokeswoman, declined to comment on the lawsuit. Ronald Kravitz, an attorney at Shepherd Finkelman Miller & Shah who represented the plaintiff, didn\\'t return a request for comment.  The lawsuit was originally filed in December 2015. In May, the case was consolidated with a similar action, Muir v. Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Co.  Duane Thompson, senior policy analyst at fiduciary consulting firm fi360 Inc., said the judge\\'s decision is largely \"in the mainstream\" when looking at decisions from similar cases involving insurance companies.  ADVISER TO FERGUSON PLAN  CapFinancial Partners, which does business as Captrust, was the investment adviser to the Ferguson Enterprises retirement plan that selected Prudential as the record keeper.  The plaintiff claimed that CapFinancial and the employer had breached their fiduciary duties by choosing \"an overly expensive menu of investment options and by failing to monitor Prudential in its administration of these various plans and investments,\" according to the court document.  However, the judge dismissed these allegations, essentially saying they \"were too vague,\" Mr. Thompson said.  Prudential and Captrust are among several financial services companies that have been sued in the past year or so for alleged fiduciary breach in 401(k) plans. Others include Voya Financial, Fidelity Investments, Neuberger Berman, Franklin Templeton, New York Life Insurance Co., American Century Investments, Edward Jones and Morgan Stanley, some of which were sued for conduct within their own company plans.

He seems to have lost all interest in work, pays me below market rate and has essentially cut me adrift on my final project  Twice a week we publish problems that will feature in a forthcoming Dear Jeremy advice column in the Saturday Guardian so that readers can offer their own advice and suggestions. We then print the best of your comments alongside Jeremy's own insights.  I work for a two-man consulting company - my boss is a friend from university and owns all of the business. Over the past 12 months he seems to have lost all interest and has not been performing at all. He has had many problems in his personal life, involving a bereavement, and hasn't been interested in winning new business or seeing to it that our current client work is done properly.  I've always been paid an extremely low salary, way below market rate, on the understanding that future business success could make up for this. However, now I feel that I've been taken advantage of, with my boss taking our client fees at market rate and using my low wage to subsidise himself. I have no proof of this, however.  We don't have an office, so we work from home, and I very rarely see my boss, and he doesn't always answer my calls or reply to my texts. We'll meet and allocate tasks, then they just won't get done.  I have been offered a good, stable job at another company and have decided to go full-time with them in March. However, until the end of February I've got one client for whom I need to do a report, but I need the help of my boss and, try as I might to communicate with him, nothing gets done. I feel completely isolated with the responsibility for a project I know will fail. Should I just leave and let him sort out the mess by himself, knowing that I'll be fine as I start with my other company soon?  Alternatively, is there anything I can say to my boss to give him that burst of motivation needed at least to get this project over the finishing line, after which we can wind up the company and go our separate ways? I don't want to let down a friend but this is becoming a nightmare, and by failing on this project I'll be letting down a high-profile client.  I'm also considering informing the client about our problems, although it will be very embarrassing at this late stage. Any help in this difficult situation would be really appreciated.

       " 'Search Summary Barbara Shecter  Financial Post 504 words 5 January 2017 The London Free Press LNDNFP Final N7 English Copyright © 2017 The London Free Press   The number of residential property sales in the greater Vancouver region fell by 5.6 per cent in 2016 - including a nearly 40 per cent yearover-year plunge in December alone - as governments took steps aimed at reining in redhot real estate markets in parts of the country.  Figures released by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver on Wednesday, however, showed that house prices have cooled by only 2.2 per cent during the past six months, with the MLS Home Price Index composite benchmark price of all residential properties in Metro Vancouver ending the year at $897,600.  \"The spate offederal and provincial measures has seen the Vancouver market temporarily freeze in its tracks, as buyers and sellers both try to assess the implications for valuations ahead,\" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC Capital Markets.  The interventions include a 15 per cent land transfer tax imposed on foreign buyers by the government of British Columbia. The federal government also made changes, including tightening qualifications for mortgage default insurance with the aim of ensuring homebuyers could manage their monthly payments at higher interest rates.  In addition, the Canada Revenue Agency is hoping to curb speculation and foreign buying by auditing tax forms to ensure house sellers who claim a principal residence tax exemption actually lived in those homes.  Shenfeld said sales volumes in greater Vancouver are likely to revive at some point this year. However, prices are expected to show \"at least some lasting impact\" from new tax measures aimed at foreign buyers, as well as government intervention designed to tighten the mortgage market, he said.  Still, he cautioned that market watchers shouldn\\'t read too much into the short-term trends, noting that Vancouver has experienced previous pricing dips that didn\\'t last.  \"And its market has historically been more volatile than, say, Toronto,\" Shenfeld added.  Dan Morrison, president of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, said the full impact of government and regulatory intervention taken in the latter half of last year won\\'t be fully understood \"for some time.\" However, some market watchers expect this year to be pivotal.  \"The macro-prudential moves taken by various levels of government to slow the acceleration of housing prices in Vancouver and other major market in Canada are expected to have the desired effect in 2017,\" said David Beattie, senior vice-president in the Financial Institutions Group at Moody\\'s Investors Service.  The numbers released Wednesday by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver showed a marked decline in sales volume in December from both the preceding month and a year earlier.  Residential property sales in the region totalled 1,714 in December, a decrease of 39.4 per cent from the sales recorded in December of 2015, and down 22.6 per cent from November of last year.  Last month\\'s sales were also 8.1 per cent below the 10-year sales average for the month.',\n",

For house buyers, the search for a home is getting more complicated.  If you want to purchase an affordable home, there are a few neighborhoods to avoid.  New York County and San Francisco County predictably top the list, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureaucomparing median home values against median household income. The median home price in New York County was 11.6 times the median income ($849,000 versus $73,000) and 9.8 times in San Francisco Count ($800,000 versus $81,000). Several of the other least affordable places were in California, including Marin County, San Mateo County and Santa Clara. Arlington, Va. Honolulu, Hawaii where the median home value is 7.78 times larger than the median income of $74,000 at $580,000 also topped the charts for least affordable homes.  Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors (NAR) said the organization\\'s numbers are consistent these findings. The highest growth seen this past quarter was in Titusville, Fla., Tampa, Fla., Boulder, Colo. and Wichita Falls Texas. Some newcomers to its list of least affordable homes include Austin, Seattle, and Denver - places that may once have been affordable but have seen home values skyrocket in recent years. \"Cities that were considered unaffordable a couple years ago have become even more so now because this is where prices are rising at the strongest rates,\" he said.  Don\\'t miss:The 10 most expensive places to raise a family in the U.S.  Pricing trends can also push homeowners back and forth between neighborhoods. For example, people used to move to Brooklyn because Manhattan was too expensive, but U.S. Census data found Brooklyn has now become less affordable than Manhattan after the influx of new inhabitants. When it comes to affordability ratings, Yun said, home prices are a larger determinant than average income level - the most expensive home in San Francisco, for example, is likely higher in price than expensive homes in Indianapolis.  This is making the climate difficult for first time home buyers. Despite the federal government\\'s efforts to boost homeownership, more millennials are currently living with family than have been in the past 75 years. As young people are push off the age they buy a first home further, Yun suggests they look to the middle of the country. \"Generally speaking the Midwest tends to be more affordable because there is more possibility to build housing,\" he said. \"Any coastal regions or mountainous regions space where is more limited for development possibility, that\\'s where the prices to shoot up really fast.\"  Also see: The $72,000 question you should be asking your real estate agent  Ultra-rich Americans own an average of 9 homes - here\\'s where they are  7 ways to keep your smart home from being hacked',\n",

Navnoor Kang, 38, the former director of fixed income and head of portfolio strategy at the New York State Common Retirement Fund (NYSCRF) and Deborah Kelley, 58, a managing director of institutional fixed income sales at a New York-based broker-dealer, have been charged\\xa0 with participating in a \"pay-for-play\" bribery scam involving the NYSCRF.  Kang was arrested yesterday in Portland and will be presented later before a US Magistrate Judge.  Kelley is expected to surrender to authorities in San Francisco, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara said.  Bharara also announced unsealing of charges against Gregg Schonhorn, a vice president of fixed income sales at a New York-based broker-dealer who pled guilty and admitted to his participation in the scheme.  Bharara said Kang allegedly steered billions of dollars of business to broker-dealers who bribed him with luxury vacations, high-priced watches, drugs and cash.  \"The hard-earned pension savings of New Yorkers should never serve as a vehicle for corrupt, personal enrichment. The intersection of public corruption and securities fraud appears to be a busy one, but it\\'s one that we are committed to policing,\" he said.  The NYSCRF was a pension fund administered for the benefit of public employees of the State of New York and is third largest pension fund in the US, holding approximately USD 184 billion in assets in trust for a total of more than one million retirees and other beneficiaries.  From January 2014 through February 2016, Kang served as Director of Fixed Income and Head of Portfolio Strategy for the NYSCRF.  In that capacity, he was responsible for investing more than USD 53 billion in fixed-income securities and was entrusted with discretion to manage those investments on behalf of the NYSCRF.  From 2014 through 2016, Kang and others participated in a scheme to defraud the NYSCRF and its members and beneficiaries that involved an agreement to pay Kang bribes - in the form of entertainment, travel, lavish meals, prostitutes, nightclub bottle service, narcotics, tickets to sports games and other events, luxury gifts and cash payments for strippers and Kang\\'s personal expenses - in exchange for fixed-income business from the NYSCRF.  Such bribes - which totaled more than USD 100,000 - were strictly forbidden by the NYSCRF, and were paid secretly and without any disclosure to the NYSCRF and its members and beneficiaries concerning the conflicts of interests inherent therein.  In exchange for the bribes paid by Kelley, Schonhorn and others, Kang used his post in the NYSCRF to promote the interests of Kelley and Schonhorn and their respective brokerage firms.

The firm calculates that of over £1trn invested in funds in the UK, £924bn sits in active funds, around three quarters of which failed to beat their benchmarks. The assets sitting in these underperforming funds amount to around £690.2bn, for which investors are paying £10.2bn in fees every year. An actively-managed fund costs investors on average 1.48%, while a passive fund charges only 0.5% on average. The firms argues investors are overpaying for these active funds, that should be charging passive prices. It calculated the total amount overpaid by investors for these underperforming active funds comes to £6.7bn a year, compared to if they charged the 0.5% passive fee. Cass professor: Your grandma could do better than 20% of active funds The report comes at a time when active managers are under increasing pressure to justify their fees. Back in November, the FCA released a scathing assessment of actively-managed funds within its Asset Management Market Study. The FCA said at the time: \"Our evidence suggests that actively-managed investments do not outperform their benchmarks after costs and that some active funds offer similar exposure to passive funds, but charge significantly more.\" Tim Holmes, managing director at Salisbury House Wealth, commented: \"When it comes to savings, ambivalence can cause serious harm - and the figures are testament to this. \"It is dangerously easy to invest money and to then forget about it for several years.

       " 'Pioneer proposes T pension shift A Boston think tank is proposing an overhaul of retirement benefits the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority offers new employees in a bid to cut costs and bring the transit workers\\' pensions in line with those of other state employees.  A Boston think tank is proposing an overhaul of retirement benefits the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority offers new employees in a bid to cut costs and bring the transit workers\\' pensions in line with those of other state employees.  In a report released Thursday, the right-leaning Pioneer Institute proposes moving management of retirement funds for new employees from the $1.5 billion MBTA Retirement Fund to the state pension system.  The authors also recommend the MBTA study leaving the federal Social Security system. While Massachusetts is one of seven states in which public employees do not contribute to Social Security, transit workers and the MBTA do contribute to it, as well as to a pension plan. In fiscal year 2016, the MBTA contributed $34 million to Social Security, according to the report.  But pulling out of Social Security may not be legally possible, and even if it is, the Boston Carmen\\'s Union, Local 589 -- which represents MBTA workers -- says it would oppose the move.  \"The union believes this is an issue now precluded by federal law,\" said Cayenne Isaksen, a spokeswoman for the local, in a statement. She said the design of the pension plan presumes additional benefits from the federal program.  A spokesman for the T declined to comment. A spokesman for the MBTA pension fund was not immediately available to comment on the Pioneer report.  The transit system\\'s pension fund is under pressure from Governor Charlie Baker to move its management to the larger state pension fund.  In July, when Baker first floated the idea publicly, pension fund spokesman Steve Crawford said the board was \"willing to examine anything that might improve performance.\"  Gregory Sullivan, Pioneer\\'s research director and coauthor of the new report, said reworking benefits for new employees would help address the MBTA\\'s growing liabilities. In the last 10 years, the pension system\\'s unfunded obligations have surged from $49 million to more than $1 billion, Pioneer said.  \"As the [MBTA pension\\'s] financial condition continues to worsen, state taxpayers are on the hook even though there is little transparency and no state oversight of the fund,\" Sullivan said in a statement.  State public employees contribute between 9 and 14 percent of their paychecks to their retirement funds, while the state kicks in 12.1 percent, according to Pioneer.  MBTA employees contribute about 12 percent of their salaries toward retirement, including both pensions and Social Security, Pioneer said; the MBTA contributes 22.2 percent.  Pioneer has been a regular critic of the MBTA pension fund, citing its lack of transparency, deteriorating finances, and generous benefits.  Beth Healy can be reached at beth.healy@globe.com.

       " 'Almost 57,000 student loan borrowers found in Australia MIL OSI New Zealand -  Source: New Zealand Government  Headline: Almost 57,000 student loan borrowers found in Australia  A new information sharing agreement between Inland Revenue and the Australian Tax Office has led to the contact details of almost 57,000 student loan borrowers being located across the Tasman, two thirds of whom are in default.  The agreement came into force in October and the details of around 10,000 New Zealanders were found in the first data match. The process has since been refined and a total of 56,897 people have now been located.  \"These borrowers have a combined loan balance of $1.2 billion and $430 million of that is in default. Inland Revenue will now start chasing up these borrowers and taking action to get their student loan repayments back on track,\" says Mr Joyce says.  Mr Woodhouse says \"The data shows that more than half of these borrowers left New Zealand over five years ago, with nearly a quarter having been away for more than 10 years. A third of them have not returned to New Zealand in the past four years. One third of the group has had no contact with Inland Revenue, and 43% have not made a payment since they left New Zealand.  \"It\\'s time these people did the right thing and met the obligations they signed up to when they took out their student loan,\" Mr Woodhouse says.  There will be further data matches in the coming months.  Inland Revenue has also revealed than more than 500,000 borrowers have now repaid their student loan in full since the scheme began in 1992. Over that period just over a million people have taken out a student loan.  The Student Loan Scheme Annual Report also shows that annual level of student loan repayments is increasing significantly.  \"The loan payments through PAYE were 6.1 per cent higher than in 2014/15 and the amount repaid directly by borrowers increased by 14.6 percent on the previous year. Since 1992 Inland Revenue has collected $11.5 billion in repayments. In the last quarter total loan repayments were 7.3 per cent higher than the same time last year,\" Mr Woodhouse says.  \"Since the overseas-based borrower programme was established in 2010, it has prompted an estimated $348 million in additional repayments in the period to October, including an increase of more than $100 million in the past financial year. This has contributed to total repayments of more than $1.2 billion in the last financial year, an 8.5 per cent increase in 12 months,\" says Mr Joyce.  \"Borrowers that stay in New Zealand after their study are the best at paying off their loans, with the latest projections showing half of these borrowers will complete repayment in less than six and a half years.\"  A copy of the Student Loan Scheme Annual Report can be found at http://www.educationcounts.govt.nz/publications/tertiary_education/annua?',\n",
       " 'Living BONUS CULL Nationwide scraps travel insurance perk for package bank account customers NATIONWIDE is scrapping its free annual European travel insurance perk for new FlexAccount switchers from next week.  New customers have until 11.59pm on Wednesday December 14 to apply for a new FlexAccount if they want to get the travel insurance perk before it disappears, MoneySavingExpert said.  Since the Bank of England cut UK interest rates from 0.5 per cent to 0.25 per cent in August, a host of banks and building societies have been axing rates and perks on their accounts.  Existing Nationwide customers who already have a FlexAccount will continue to get their free travel insurance cover, provided they continue to meet the building society\\'s eligibility criteria.  A spokesperson for Nationwide told The Sun Online the travel insurance perk was being axed in order to \"simplify our current account range.\"  The building society\\'s spokesperson added: \"Although the FlexAccount current account remains popular, only a very small number of new customers go on to take the benefit.\"  Helen Saxon, MoneySavingExpert\\'s chief product analyst, said: \"The Nationwide free travel insurance offer has been around as long as I can remember.  \"But from next week it\\'ll be added to the long casualty list of banks cut or canned in 2016.  \"Completely free travel insurance is a rare perk, and it\\'s an especially good deal for older account holders between 65 and 75, when travel insurance starts to get expensive.  \"But, if you\\'re paying Natiownide to upgrade the insurance to family or worldwide insurance or you\\'re paying the 75-and-over premium, it\\'s always best to compare if you could get separate travel insurance more cheaply.  \"It\\'s also a good idea to look at other bank account perks that give you £100 to switch to them, and ongoing rewards - that could pay for several years\\' travel insurance. Decide what\\'s most important to you.\"  New customers looking to open a FlexAccount with the travel insurance perk will need to activate the travel insurance by sending back a form from Nationwide detailing any medical conditions, even if they don\\'t have any.  Anyone using the official current account switching service will be able to send the medical declaration form back to Nationwide straight away.  Customers who don\\'t use the official switching service have to send the medical form back to Nationwide after paying in at least £750 a month into the account for three months.  To continue getting the free travel insurance perk, FlexAccount customers have to pay in at least £750 into their account every month and send in a medical declaration form every year.  Nationwide FlexAccount customers aged 75 or over will need to purchase an \\'age upgrade\\' policy every year to continue getting travel insurance cover.We pay for your stories!

       " 'REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial) Obama\\'s Giant Student-Loan Con Democrats devised the government takeover of student loans as an entitlement that might never be repaid, though they sold it as a money saver. New evidence of this giant con arrives courtesy of a report this week by the Government Accountability Office that estimates the taxpayer losses at $108 billion and counting.  To help pay for ObamaCare, Democrats simultaneously federalized the student loan market and projected fictitious savings, all while adding more than $1.2 trillion to the federal balance sheet. The amount keeps increasing like the debt clock. Liberals then cited the government \"savings\" to peddle the fallacy that the feds make money off student loans -- a pretext they then used to sweeten debt forgiveness plans that have helped keep default rates artificially low.  The Education Department claims the national student loan default rate is 11.3%, yet only half of all debt is in repayment. Borrowers can seek forbearance or deferment if they are unemployed, return to school or claim financial difficulties. Or they can enroll in income-based repayment plans that let them discharge the debt after making payments equal to 10% of their discretionary income for 20 years. Those who work in \"public service\" -- government or a nonprofit -- can wipe out their debt in 10 years without a tax penalty.  Initially, only students who borrowed in 2014 or later were eligible for these generous loan forgiveness plans. Then President Obama retroactively extended the benefits to buy millennial votes. Over the last three years the share of outstanding federal direct loan dollars in income-based repayment plans has doubled to 40%. Costs have exploded.  GAO estimates that 5.3 million borrowers, or 24% of former students, have enrolled in income-based repayment plans. They collectively owe $355 billion, $108 billion of which will eventually be forgiven. But this sum covers only loans through the current school year and will likely grow as more borrowers exploit the entitlement. In April the Administration announced a goal of adding two million to the debt-forgiveness rolls over the next year.  The agency scores the Education Department for repeatedly low-balling the cost, which has made its loan forgiveness look more affordable. Over eight years the Administration\\'s budget estimates for income-based repayment plans have more than doubled to $53 billion. The department now forecasts that taxpayers will pick up about 21% of the cost for loans in these plans.  GAO warns that the department may still be undershooting the actual cost since it \"assumes no borrowers will switch into or out\" of the plans. The department\\'s \"quality control practices do not ensure reliable budget estimates,\" GAO concludes, with hilarious understatement. A company that was this sloppy with its accounting would be prosecuted.  To sum up: The Obama Democrats used student loans and loan forgiveness to buy votes and dissembled about the cost. Now as they leave town they are handing Republicans the bill. As for millennials, they\\'ll pay in the end with higher tax rates.',\n",
       " 'Law Judges go to war with the government over pensions [CORRECTED] Correction: We incorrectly stated (Law, Nov 17) that the salary of a High Court Judge is £183,328 a year. The correct figure is £179,768.  It is unprecedented for the judiciary to take legal action against the government  Yet this week 106 judges did just that. They began a claim in the employment tribunal alleging unlawful discrimination over a new pension scheme that they were forced to join last year.  This scheme, they say, penalises them on ground of age and, in some cases, of race and sex. Michael Beloff, QC, representing six High Court judges, told the tribunal hearing this week that while the judges could have expected a 68 per cent drop in earnings when they went onto the bench, they could not have anticipated that their pensions would be altered \"to their substantial financial detriment\" by the government, reducing their take-home pay and their long-term benefits. \"They were the victims of a deliberate double whammy,\" he said.  All the judges, he said, were \"high flyers\" appointed at a relatively early age. While older judges within ten years of retirement were protected from the changes, the younger set were exposed to the \"highly disadvantageous\" scheme.  High Court judges receive a salary of £183,328 a year. Take-home pay has dropped to £72,357 - some £25,000 less than before the pension changes. Why, Beloff asked, is one group of High Court judges (the younger ones), doing exactly the same kind of work, being treated less favourably than another, \"simply because of their date of birth?\"  Nor can the judges return to practice: a career as a judge is \"a one-way street\" and they are barred from going back to the Bar or being a solicitor. \"They are all, in a real sense, in a trap,\" the QC said.  The case goes wider than pay. The judges also claim a breach of a long-held constitutional principle, dating back at least to the Act of Settlement 1701, that neither the legislature nor the executive should subject judges to a reduction in pay (including deferred pay such as pensions) when in office. This principle is \"designed to protect the independence of the judiciary, a key element of the rule of law\".  It emerged at the hearing that ministers are proposing a 12-15 per cent pay offer to High Court judges. That offer in itself, Beloff argues, \"fatally undermines - or at least severely damages\" ministers\\' case that the changes were justified - and is in effect to compensate them for the losses they have suffered. Nor will it remove the discrimination between older and younger judges.  Martin Chamberlain, QC, for the lord chancellor and Ministry of Justice, disgrees that any constitutional principle requires judges to be insulated from adverse pension changes when other public servants are not. And a transitional protection period for those older judges closer to retirement is legitimate. In other words, judges are not a special case.  The hearing will last two weeks. It may well be that judgment coincides with another constitutional clash: the Supreme Court case on Brexit.',\n",
       " 'Concerned with Running Out of Money in Retirement? New MassMutual Annuity Option Helps People Secure Their Future Nov. 16 -- Running out of money is the number one fear of many people approaching retirement, according to the LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute.[1] The average American retiring at age 65 today can reasonably expect to spend the next 20 to 30 years in retirement, meaning retirement savings may have to last longer than ever before.  This is one reason why deferred income annuities - also called \"longevity annuities\" - have become so popular with consumers in recent years. Deferred income annuities can help solve for some of the risks associated with longevity - like increased health care costs - by providing a stream of future income that can last a lifetime.  There\\'s been a catch-22, however, for owners of qualified assets, such as those in a traditional IRA or 401(k) plan, who wanted to use those assets to fund a deferred income annuity. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) generally requires that distributions from these qualified assets must begin no later than age 701/2. Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) rules make it difficult for owners of qualified assets to plan for late-retirement income needs.  In response to the need for greater flexibility for owners of qualified assets, Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company (MassMutual) recently expanded its deferred income annuity product offering by making it available as a qualified longevity annuity contract (QLAC).  A QLAC is a deferred income annuity offered by an insurance company that allows distributions to begin after age 70 1/2. Approved in 2014 by the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, new rules allow owners of qualified assets to delay receiving distributions from the assets in a QLAC up until a maximum age of 85; once distributions begin, all standard RMD rules apply.  Because of strict IRS limits on how a QLAC can be established and funded, this option isn\\'t right for everyone. However, when it is set up and maintained correctly, a QLAC may help the owner to:  * Supplement Social Security retirement benefits or pension benefits with a predictable stream of future income.  * Transfer some of the risks associated with longevity to the insurer. Future income is guaranteed, no matter how long the owner lives or what happens in the financial markets.  * Manage RMDs and plan for expenses that may become a priority later in retirement (such as increased health care costs).  \"No matter how you envision retirement, having the freedom to live life your way will depend, at least in part, on having a secure source of income you cannot outlive,\" said Craig Waddington, actuary and head of retail solutions deployment at MassMutual. \"Although no one can predict the future with 100% accuracy, there are steps you can take today to prepare for a more secure and comfortable future, no matter how long your retirement lasts.\"  Footnote:  [1] LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute, The Retirement Income Reference Book 2015  Source: Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance',\n",
       " 'Economy ECB\\'s Constâncio Sees Heightened Uncertainty Following U.S. Election; Comments indicate the ECB might be wary of slowing or stopping its bond-purchase program FRANKFURT-A top European Central Bank official said the world economy faces \"an abnormal degree of uncertainty\" in the wake of U.S. elections, warning that rising protectionism and political risks in Europe could derail economic growth.  While investors have so far reacted positively to Donald Trump\\'s unexpected victory, policy makers \"should be cautious in drawing hasty, positive conclusions,\" ECB Vice President Vítor Constâncio said, speaking at a financial conference on Monday.  Stock markets surged last week as investors bet that Mr. Trump would fulfill campaign promises of spending more money on infrastructure and the military. Bond prices fell and yields rose amid expectations that greater spending by the U.S. government would boost inflation.  \"So far, [market] developments point to a U.S. rise in economic growth, but in the context of an \"America first\" policy,\" Mr. Constancio said.  He warned that Europe\\'s export-dependent economies could suffer if the U.S. tilts toward greater protectionism. Mr. Trump has indicated he favors tearing up some trade deals.  \"World trade, already quite weak, may continue to collapse, hurting all open economies dependent on exports,\" Mr. Constancio said. In emerging-market economies, capital outflows and currency depreciation are already under way, he said.  The comments indicate the ECB might be wary of slowing or stopping its ?1.7 trillion ($1.85 trillion) bond-purchase program soon.  ECB policy makers are currently preparing for a key meeting on Dec. 8, where they are expected to decide on the future of their ?80 billion a month bond-purchase program. The program, known as quantitative easing, is to end in March.  Mr. Constancio stressed economic forecasts for the eurozone are \"predicated on the current supportive financial conditions persisting.\" He expressed concern about the weakness of core inflation, which strips out volatile energy and food prices.  \"Core inflation?is not recovering, which may affect the dynamics of headline inflation going forward, affecting our monetary policy,\" Mr. Constancio said.  The ECB aims to keep inflation just below 2%, but it has missed that target for more than three years. Most economists therefore expect the central bank to extend its bond-purchase program by at least six months.  Mr. Constancio said the eurozone\\'s inflation rate would likely rise well above 1% by next spring. But he warned of a range of political risks in Europe that could cause economic shock-waves. Italy\\'s government has scheduled a referendum early next month on overhauls to the nation\\'s constitution, on which Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has staked his political future.  Mr. Constancio urged European governments to help out the ECB by boosting government spending and carrying out economic overhauls.  \"Europe must endeavor to work together to face a more challenging world that threatens European values of open and tolerant societies,\" he said.

       " \"Should you top up your nest egg? Should you top up your nest egg?  A lthough the relevant legislation is yet to be passed by the Senate, it's likely super fund members will be able to contribute up to $180,000 (age 65 to 74) or $540,000 (under 65) this financial year as non- concessional contributions. For those with more than $1.6million in super already, it's the last opportunity to boost their superannuation account by making personal non-tax-deductible contributions. For those with lower account balances, there'll still be further opportunities to contribute up to $100,000 (64 to 74) or up to $300,000 (under 65) after July 1, 2017, when the new rules apply. The incentive to make a large additional contribution this year is thus greatest for those with larger account balances or already in retirement or soon to retire. For younger and middle aged people, making large super contributions is less attractive because since 1999 all new contributions are untouchable until age 60. Even for those where gaining access is not an issue, funding a large contribution can be a problem especially when it involves the sale of assets or borrowing against those assets. Selling existing assets triggers any attached capital gains tax liability as well as the risks of achieving comparable after-tax rates of return in the super fund. In today's low interest rate environment, the interest costs of borrowing aren't high but the taxation rules don't allow a tax deduction for interest payments incurred. Borrowing is thus likely to be a viable option only when the loan can be repaid quickly. The biggest incentive to make a large super contribution this year is that from July 1, 2017, those with existing balances of $1.6 million or more won't be eligible to make further non-concessional contributions to their fund. This $1.6million cap will include the notional lump sum value of defined benefit pensions received by the super fund members. This gives defined benefit pension recipients a special reason to investigate the benefits of making a large additional lump sum contribution this tax year while they still can. In evaluating the merits ofadding to superannuation balances by making voluntary contributions, the key consideration is the taxation savings. Given that comparable pre-tax investment returns are available from investments inside and outside super, moving money into super makes sense only if the tax burden on personal investments exceeds that in the super fund. In pension phase, superannuation provides tax- free income after age 60 while in accumulation funds, the maximum income tax rate is 15 per cent with tax-free withdrawals after age 60. In practical terms this means that higher income retirees are most likely to benefit from what for a considerable number will be their last chance to move a large amount into their super fund.

       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING Foreign gilt buying soars in September; Capital markets Overseas investors made their heftiest purchases since October 2015  International investors bought the most UK government debt in almost a year in September, as turbulence in the pound failed to dent overseas appetite that has helped keep a cap on Britain\\'s borrowing costs.  Investors from outside the UK increased their holdings of gilts by £13.3bn in September, data from the Bank of England showed yesterday, a sharp rise on the £1.8bn added in August and the heftiest purchases since October 2015.  Since the vote for Brexit in June, overseas demand for gilts has been closely tracked given international investors own roughly a quarter of the £1.6tn market that sets the government\\'s borrowing costs and is a benchmark for companies. Before the EU referendum, the Treasury warned a vote for Brexit could spur heavy selling of gilts from outside the UK.  Gilt prices did fall in the first half of September before closing out the month up from their lows, with the 10-year benchmark yield ending at 0.74 per cent. Yields move in the opposite direction to a bond\\'s price. The pound weakened 1.3 per cent in the month.  But October has proved much more brutal as Brexit-inspired weakness in the pound rattled the sovereign debt market.  The pound has slumped 6 per cent to below $1.22, helping to send the yield on the 10-year gilt to 1.24 per cent, as the faltering currency raises fears of inflation among bondholders.  Gianluca Salford, senior European fixed-income strategist at JPMorgan, cautioned that BoE data that looked positive may not have captured the full extent of international investor positioning, pointing out the fresh weakness in the pound will have widened losses for anyone converting returns into another currency.  The pound and gilts have been under fire since the start of October, when Britain\\'s prime minister, Theresa May, used the Conservative party conference to signal the government was pursuing a hard Brexit that prioritised control over migration, and attacked the BoE\\'s stimulus policies for harming savers.  Bondholders say the shift in political rhetoric towards the BoE and governor Mark Carney has contributed to this month\\'s selling. \"The political and market consensus in support of central banks doing whatever it takes to support the economy is fracturing,\" said David Riley, head of credit strategy at BlueBay Asset Management.  \"The low interest rate policies and quantitative easing - large-scale asset purchases - by the world\\'s major central banks are increasingly under attack from politicians,\" he added.  In the wake of the Brexit vote, the Bank of England opted to cut interest rates to a 322-year low and restart a £70bn quantitative easing programme to bolster the economy, encouraging a rally in gilts.  But the move has drawn loud complaints from pension funds that argue low rates widened deficits, while banks say that ultra-low interest rates obstruct their business models.',\n",
       " 'Pro Bankruptcy Stech\\'s Take: U.S. Bankruptcies Cite Weak Canadian Dollar; Exchange rates deter cross-border tourists Fewer Canadian tourists are crossing the border to spend money in U.S. stores and stay overnight in hotels. And that has been a financial killer for businesses that have historically relied on that spending to survive.  Two Maine hotels-the 94-bed Country Inn Bangor and the 75-bed Comfort Inn Brunswick-that counted on Canadian visitors are quieter these days. Their owner, Austin Hotels LLC, filed for chapter 11 protection on Oct. 24.  \"The last three years have seen the Canadian economy take a significant downturn, caused in large part by the global decrease in the price of oil, and the value of the Canadian dollar has dropped against the U.S. dollar,\" Austin Hotels lawyer George Marcus said in documents filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Portland, Maine. \"The impact on Canadian tourism in Maine was immediate and punishing.\"  The same pressure was felt by Total Hockey Inc., the sport\\'s largest U.S. equipment retailer, which filed for bankruptcy on July 6. The retailer\\'s stores had been profitable until last year.  In court papers, Chief Restructuring Officer Lee A. Diercks said the retailer\\'s troubles worsened as warmer winter weather affected the outdoor skating scene in Minnesota and Michigan and as the Canadian dollar\\'s value fell against the U.S. dollar.  \"Because of this, many of the [chain\\'s] retail locations that are strong host cities for youth tournaments...saw many fewer Canadian teams enter events and, if they did attend, they spent far less because of adverse exchange rates,\" Mr. Diercks said in a filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in St. Louis, adding that the chain also had a messy expansion to blame.  Total Hockey lawyers looked for buyers for the 725-worker chain. It was eventually purchased by the Massachusetts-based parent company behind the Pure Hockey and Commonwealth Lacrosse chains in a deal valued at $22.5 million.  The value of the Canadian dollar began falling in 2014, mimicking the drop in natural gas and oil prices. At the current exchange rate, the Canadian dollar is worth just 75 U.S. cents.  The two currencies were near parity for several years before 2014, making trips across the border particularly attractive for Canadian shoppers and tourists.  The Wall Street Journal previously reported on a Washington state dairy farm that had laid off about a dozen of its 110 workers after seeing fewer British Columbia tourists for customers. The report, published in March, noted that the number of Canadian residents traveling to the U.S. fell by a fifth from a year earlier.  Beyond tourism, the strength of the U.S. dollar has hurt the appetite for many American products, from auto parts to vegetables, the Journal noted.  Economists don\\'t see the currency strengthening anytime soon.  Kim Mackrael contributed to this article.  Write to Katy Stech at katherine.stech@wsj.com',\n",

Hayman and some partners scored a success developing TFC (The Franchise Company) into a major corporation, selling out to the majority shareholder.  He later gained a background in housing, working with a Texasbased think-tank trying to deal with communities facing widespread vacancies after the housing crash in 2008.  Hayman formed fivewalls in partnership with Lee Piccoli, chief executive of Guelph-based Fusion Homes.  Home buyers and sellers often hooked up with agents by wordof-mouth or meetingthem at open houses, Hayman said.  But with the real estate market moving online, there was a need for people to research real estate agents online, along with homes, he said.  \" From the estimates we had, about 10 per cent of the market was already doing that and we thought we could build a business on that .\" More recent research shows 30 per cent of consumers are finding real estate agents online, Hayman said.  The London-St. Thomas real estate market has been hot for months and is on track to hit record sales this year.  But the downside for realtors is that competition for listings is intense.  Agents from major brokerages including ReMax, Royal LePage and Sutton Group have joined fivewalls, Hayman said.  / (See hardcopy for photo);',\n",
       " 'Money Maternity leave - What happens if the baby\\'s born early Every woman working in the UK is allowed 52 weeks\\' leave after they have a baby - but what happens if the baby is premature? These are your rights  For some mothers, everything is straightforward. Their baby returns home with them from hospital straight from the labour ward and their maternity leave continues for the next 52 weeks if they want.  For others, things are less simple.  That\\'s because maternity leave automatically starts from the day you give birth, not the day your child\\'s strong enough to come home with you.  \"An employee can choose to start her maternity leave on any day, provided that it is not longer than 11 weeks before the week the baby is due,\" explained Aye Limbin Glassey, employment law partner at Shakespeare Martineau.  \"However where a baby is born prematurely her maternity leave starts automatically on the day after the date of the birth, no matter whether born prematurely or not.\"  Statutory Maternity Pay explained: How to get it, how much money you can claim and how long it lasts  \"When workers have children prematurely, they are under an enormous amount of strain dealing with the baby and even when their child is well enough to leave hospital care, they will have to face the stark reality that a significant chunk of their statutory leave and pay has been used up,\" Limbin Glassey explained.  \"This seems harsh and it is understandable that parents in this position would feel that they need more flexibility and support.  \"However, under current laws, maternity leave and pay automatically starts the day after a premature baby is born and employers are under no obligation to extend this,\" she added.  The good news is that this week an amendment to the law is being debated in Parliament that would change things if passed.  \"If the amendment ... is made law, employers could be obliged to delay the start of maternity leave and pay to begin only after the period for which the premature baby is under hospital care,\" Limbin Glassey said.  Meet the mum campaigning for more maternity leave for mothers of premature babies  While things could soon change, that\\'s of little help to people having children before then.  So what can you do now?  \"We advise that parents facing this situation start discussions with their employer at the earliest opportunity to enable the employer to put necessary arrangements in place and limit disruption,\" Limbin Glassey said.  \"The more time an employer is given to be able to fully consider the options and plan, the more likely it is that an agreement can be reached.  \"This is understandably unlikely to be the parent\\'s top priority, so they may want to consider nominating someone like a family member to maintain communication with their employer on their behalf.  \"This will allow for a mutually-beneficial working relationship throughout the maternity period and beyond.\"  Was your baby born too soon?

       " 'Australia : New data highlights the flaws in failed VET FEE-HELP scheme New statistics released today reveal the full extent of the failure of Labors VET FEE-HELP scheme that has seen unscrupulous providers prey on vulnerable students and the cost to taxpayers blow out from $325 million in 2012 to $1.8 billion in 2014 and $2.9 billion in 2015.  Minister for Education and Training Simon Birmingham said the issues with VET FEE-HELP are why the Turnbull Government will shut it down at the end of 2016 with the new VET Student Loans program starting in January with course restrictions for providers, loan caps and student engagement requirements.  The 2015 data is littered with even more examples of rorting and shonky behaviour from some providers who continue to take advantage of students and taxpayers and tarnish the reputation of the vocational education and training sector, Minister Birmingham said.  The Turnbull Governments new VET Student Loans program will return integrity to the vocational education sector and deliver a win-win for students and taxpayers through a range of protections.  Minister Birmingham said the new data showed the number of enrolments had increased from just 5,300 in 2009 to around 321,000 in 2015, highlighting the runaway growth in the scheme before our initial reforms started to fix it in 2016.  Minister Birmingham said that the structure of VET FEE-HELP scheme meant there were too many students being signed up for courses simply to boost providers enrolment numbers or to provide lifestyle choices that dont lead to work.  Australians rightly expect that any subsidies students get are focused on areas of study most likely to improve employment outcomes, Minister Birmingham said.  Vocational education is a key feature of post-school learning in Australia and it is fundamental to our future success as we transition to a 21st century economy. But that means we also need to ensure that taxpayer support for students is targeted at skills that are in high demand and valued by employers.  These new statistics highlight that up to one in five students were doing VET FEE-HELP courses not to improve their job prospects, but to pursue lifestyle interests. While I understand some people may want to broaden their experiences, we need to ensure precious taxpayer money is used to support students doing courses with strong employment outcomes, which also increases the prospects of people paying back their government loan.  All diploma level courses were eligible under VET FEE-HELP, which meant we had a list of more than 800 courses being subsidised by taxpayers despite many being lifestyle focused with little relevance to employment outcomes.  With our new VET Student Loans program we will ensure providers go through a rigorous application process and extensive monitoring and evaluation to ensure they are delivering education that students and employers value and that taxpayers are willing to continue supporting.  VET Student Loans will only support legitimate students to undertake worthwhile and value-for-money courses at quality training providers.',\n",
       " 'Business Bond fund warning as sell-off fears increase BONDS Savers may find they cannot withdraw cash if the market hits trouble, says James Connington  Turmoil in bond markets and a spike in the number of investors wanting to withdraw money \"raises questions\" about the suitability of popular bond funds, leading analysts have warned.  Bond funds - where savers\\' cash is pooled and then invested in loans issued by governments and companies - are among the most popular holdings in savers\\' Isas and pensions.  Many savers view them as a supposedly lower-risk source of income.  But analysts Manuel Arrive and Alastair Sewell of Fitch, the ratings agency, this week questioned whether these funds could withstand a rush to the exit by investors alarmed by a fall in bond prices. They have suggested some funds restrict withdrawals to weekly intervals.  They argue that while these funds allow withdrawals to be made on a daily basis, their managers may struggle to sell holdings quickly enough to be able to pay out.  One outcome could be the forced sale of holdings at poor prices into an already falling market. Another could be the decision by fund managers to temporarily restrict withdrawals.  The warnings are reminiscent of the difficulties facing commercial property funds earlier this year, when a sharp increase in withdrawals forced funds to stop dealing until they could raise cash by selling buildings.  With \"open ended\" funds, such as unit trusts, investors buy units. There is no limit to the number of units that can be issued.  When withdrawals occur, the fund needs to have the cash to meet them and the units are then cancelled.  If there is little or no market to sell holdings to at the time, managers can battle to put a value on the portfolio and individual units.  With property funds, this dilemma could be seen in the \"temporary value adjustments\" that applied to many over the summer.  Mr Arrive said: \"We haven\\'t seen the same reaction from investors in bond funds as was seen in several UK property funds following the Brexit vote. Some fund types are going to be more exposed to liquidity risk if investor sentiment turns quickly.\"  According to Fitch\\'s report, the need to meet redemption requests at all times has pushed open-ended bond fund managers to maintain higher cash balances, hindering performance.  While Fitch acknowledged that managers have \"taken steps\" to better manage the risk posed by liquidity, the report claims \"there have been few evolutions in the redemption terms and conditions for open-ended funds\".  By comparison, investment trusts, or \"closed-ended\" funds have a natural release mechanism built in.  Investors buy shares in the investment company itself from a limited issue, and the share price can swing to a premium or a discount compared to the value of the underlying holdings.  In July, Muna Abu-Habsa, an analyst at investment data firm Morningstar, suggested that unit-trust type funds should be limited in the level of illiquid holdings they contain.',\n",

Their responsibilities include the Multi Asset Fund (MAF) Strategic, which is open to investors with a lump sum of at least ?5,400 or those who agree to invest ?100 a month.  Philosophy The MAF Strategic invests in a selection of different asset classes including cash, bonds, equities, property and alternatives such as commodities. It\\'s designed for investors looking for a balanced mix between investments that offer potential for growth but are more defensive in nature.  \"We\\'re trying to create an investment solution that ensures ongoing suitability for investors,\" said Wells. \"It\\'s not just finding a solution that is appropriate for an investor at a single point in time, but one that is an appropriate solution on an ongoing basis.\"  Performance The fund is up 3.4% over a year, while over three years the fund is up an average of 7.6% a year. The fund\\'s five-year annualised return is 7.4%.  \"Last year was a challenging period but we invest for a three-year time horizon and on that basis our performance has been very good,\" said Wells.  Buying and selling The fund classifies its holdings under three broad categories: growth assets such as equities and high yield bonds; defensive assets which include government and investment grade bonds; and uncorrelated assets such as property.  The fund has recently taken profits on some of its growth asset holdings including North American, European and emerging market equities.  \"There\\'s been a very strong rally in the last number of months so we took some money of the table,\" said Wells. \"We will go back in at more attractive levels if there is any sort of correction.\"  Wells said that over the past nine months the fund had increased its holding of global high yielding bonds as well as emerging market currency bonds of countries such as Indonesia and South Africa.  \"These positions have done particularly well,\" he said. \"Performance of emerging market local currency debt has been in double digits.\"  About 7% of the fund is currently held in cash, higher than its historical average. Wells, pictured, said it was part of the fund\\'s current strategy of \"building up its dry powder\".  Outlook Wells sees a sustained period of volatility ahead but he believes markets will stay \"range bound\".  \"None of the sources of volatility such as fears over China, American interest rate hikes, or Brexit have left us,\" he said.  \"Markets are volatile and they\\'re going to stay volatile.\"  Wells intends to use any sell-offs to build on the fund\\'s current strategy of holding income-paying assets.  \"If there are market corrections we will be adding risk and adding to emerging market debt local currency and global high yield.

       " 'Residential Customers Seeing Lower Electric Bills Thanks to NatGas, EIA Says Besides helping to lower carbon emissions, the continued growth of cheap natural gas-fired power generation in the United States in 2016 seems to be lowering residential electric bills as well.  Based on data collected through the first half of 2016, U.S. residential electricity prices are trending down for the first time in over a decade, according to the Energy Information Administration\\'s (EIA) \"Today in Energy\" note published Thursday.  Through six months \"residential customers paid on average 12.4 cents/kWh, or 0.7% lower than the same period last year,\" EIA wrote. \"If this trend continues for the rest of 2016, annual average residential electricity prices would decline for the first time since 2002. Over the past five years, nominal residential prices have increased an average of 1.9% annually, about the same rate as overall inflation.\"  Residential ratepayers \"in most areas of the country are seeing lower retail electricity prices this year compared with the same time last year,\" and the availability of cheap natural gas has been one of the main catalysts, EIA said. \"Over the first six months of 2016, the weighted average cost of natural gas delivered to electricity generators was $2.58/MMBtu, 28% lower than the first half of 2015.\"  The New England region, coming off higher retail and wholesale power prices between 2013 and 2014, has seen residential prices fall by 6% through the first six months of 2016, averaging around 19.2 cents/kWh, EIA said. \"Improved supplies of natural gas into the region, along with lower natural gas prices, have contributed to the region\\'s declining retail electricity rates so far in 2016.\"  Noting a recent uptick in natural gas prices, EIA said its latest projections expect the average delivered cost of natural gas to be 27% higher in 2H2016 compared to 1H2016, with prices continuing to trend upward in 2017. Consequently, U.S. residential electricity prices are also expected to increase in 2017 by 3%, EIA said.  \"Not all recent declines in electricity prices can be attributed to developments in natural gas markets,\" EIA said. Hawaii, for example, uses petroleum in a number of its generating units, \"and the falling cost of crude oil has contributed to a 12% decline in retail electricity prices so far in 2016.\"  After natural gas overtook coal\\'s monthly share of U.S. electric generation for the first time in decades in 2015, power sector demand for gas has continued to increase in 2016 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 2).  The increased role of gas in the power stack has helped drive down greenhouse gas emissions, with U.S. carbon dioxide emissions falling below 2005 levels last year (see Daily GPI, May 9).  Even President Obama on Monday defended the role natural gas and unconventional shale development have played in addressing climate change (see Daily GPI, Oct. 4).

       " 'Help clients get the most from Medicare: Retirement Scan Our daily roundup of retirement news your clients may be thinking about.  Medicare recipients: Tips on getting what\\'s yours  Many seniors fail to make the most of Medicare, as they don\\'t understand how the program works, and they make the wrong decisions when choosing the coverage and timing their enrollment, according to this article in USA Today. \"People are used to employer health insurance and are surprised when they need to make all these complicated decisions for themselves when they move to Medicare. There often is no one to help them,\" says the expert. \"Medicare is so needlessly complicated that people often are paralyzed, cannot make a decision and thus do nothing.\" One mistake people make is not switching their Medicare plans during the annual open enrollment period, which runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7 each year. Research shows that millions of people could find better coverage at lower cost if they took advantage of this \"terrific do over\" opportunity, an expert said.  How to defuse the tax bomb in your retirement plans  To minimize the tax bite on their savings and maximize after-tax income in retirement, clients may want to use a portion of their traditional IRA to buy a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract, according to this article on Forbes. They may also consider purchasing fixed and variable deferred annuities and investing in stocks, as dividends are taxed at a lower rate or not taxed depending on their tax bracket. Another option is to tap their home equity by applying for a reverse mortgage for tax-free income, or home equity line of credit with a tax-deductible interest.  Should you try to market-time your dollar-cost averaging strategy?  Retirement savers may want to consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy, which requires clients with a fixed amount of funds to follow a certain schedule for investing the money, according to this article on Motley Fool. \"I believe in dollar-cost averaging, rather than just waiting to have a huge lump sum and dumping it in, because what if then the market falls two weeks after that?\" says an expert. \"You\\'ve basically treated your entire savings as that one investment, rather than waiting until right after or right before and splitting it in half.\"  Using \\'brokerage window\\' to expand 401(k) options  401(k) participants who want to manage their own investments may want to use their employer\\'s brokerage window, which allow employees to choose their investments from a broader menu of individual stocks and mutual funds, according to this article on CNBC. More employers are offering brokerage window to their workers. \"About 15 to 20% of our overall book of plans uses these, but 45 to 50% of the very large firms offer them,\" says an expert with Fidelity. \"The large plans have a level of sophistication from an administrative standpoint. They have educational programs and oversight that allows them to take that responsibility on.\"',\n",
       " 'News Landlords will face tougher tests from mortgage lenders Landlords will face tougher stress tests from mortgage lenders next year as the Bank of England attempts to bring the booming buy-to-let sector into line with the rest of the housing market.  For the first time, the Bank\\'s Prudential Regulation Authority has implemented regulations that a landlord must meet to be given a mortgage.  The rules have been introduced to ensure landlords do not get into mortgage payment difficulties if interest rates were to climb sharply or if a landlord\\'s income fell sharply.  However, some brokers have criticised the changes, arguing that they are an attack on small landlords who may struggle to pass the affordability tests.  \"This feels like the regulator is looking to, if not prosecute, then certainly rein in the buy-to-let market very, very hard,\" Simon Collins, at the mortgage broker John Charcol, said.  Richard Donnell, research director at the property analyst Hometrack, said that the regulations would require some landlords to find as much as £35,000 more of their own money to receive a mortgage.  Mr Donnell said: \"That\\'s a lot of money. If you take it alongside the extra stamp duty costs for buy-to-let and the tax relief changes, then buy-to-let has gone from being a no-brainer for investors to forcing people to put more money in and minimise the risk. This may mean a slowdown in the buy-to-let market.\"  The sector has enjoyed a boom in the past ten years. Some two million people are now private landlords, together renting out five million properties, according to Paragon, a mortgage lender.  Yet the Bank of England has been concerned for some time that the unregulated lending boom was a threat to the economy, arguing that a sudden sell-off of landlords\\' properties in an economic downturn would have a drastic effect on the housing market.  Landlords have already faced a tough year from regulators. In April, the government introduced an additional 3 per cent stamp duty surcharge on second homes and buy-to-let properties. George Osborne, the former chancellor, also reduced the tax relief landlords will be able to claim on mortgage payments from 2017.  Under the changes from the Bank of England, banks and specialist buy-to-let lenders will also be required to make sure that a landlord could still afford to meet their mortgage repayments if interest rates were to rise to 5.5 per cent over a minimum of five years.  The Bank\\'s financial regulator will also ask lenders to assess whether a borrower\\'s monthly rental income from a property is enough to cover their mortgage payments, or whether the landlord has enough of their own money to be able to keep paying the mortgage. This ratio will be 125 per cent so if a landlord\\'s monthly mortgage costs are £1,000, then the rent they must receive is £1,250 a month.',\n",
       " 'News Long-term care delay post-fire frustrates seniors The leadership of Fort McMurray\\'s leading seniors\\' advocacy group says further delaying a planned longterm care facility during the rebuild \"goes beyond common sense.\"  During a Monday meeting of the municipality\\'s Land Planning and Transportation Committee, it was announced development of the long-term care facility was stalled.  Council is willing to commit $10.5 million to the project as soon as the province reaches out to the advisory committee on aging. The municipality is still awaiting a response, and administration says the delay is an example of the wildfire\\'s fallout slowing bureaucracy.  Joan Furber, president of the Golden Years Society, said in May she hoped the project would not be forgotten during the rebuilding process. Now, she says many seniors are back to wondering when any progress on the project will be made.  \"When I read what happened, my mouth jus t dropped,\" she said. \"Is the message that people have to work here for decades then leave town when they\\'re old?  How much of a priority do we have to be?\" Last November, the province announced the long-term care facility planned for Parsons Creek would be moved to Willow Square, the site seniors had said they preferred. Consultation would be held over the next year to influence the design phase.  At the time, the province estimated a four-year wait for a Willow Square facility to open, factoring in time for consultation, design and construction.  \"This is the year they should have been consulting overtime with our community,\"  says Tany Yao, Wildrose MLA for Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo. \"We know they have the money for it in the provincial budget, there\\'s no reason why they can\\'t still be doing those meetings with us right now.\"  Shortly after the city reopened, Furber says the message from municipal and provincial officials would be that development of Willow Square could be delayed up to a year. She says few seniors had an issue with that and understood the circumstances. Yet, there was still an expectation that consultation would continue in some form.  \"So much has happened in the last few months, we get that things are going to be a little late,\" she says. \"It\\'s just there seems to be an excuse for everything. When I was told things would be slower, and again I understood that, we were also told not to worry.\"  The bureaucratic fallout of the wildfire has also delayed construction and consultation for several other capital projects, the committee was told. These include the Conklin Multiplex and the redevelopment of expropriated land in downtown Fort McMurray.  vmcdermott@postmedia.com  Olivia Condon, Fort Mcmurray Today, Postmedia Network / The large sign promoting an aging in place facility, what would have been Willow Square, sits vacant more than three years since the sign was erected on the corner of Franklin Ave. and Hospital Street in Fort McMurray Alta., September 27, 2016.;',\n",
       " 'Business On the Money: How to protect against law-breaking landlords Don\\'t let your landlord harass you - the law could well be on your side  One in five private tenants in London has been a victim of law-breaking landlords, with renters having gas and electricity supplies cut off, deposits left unprotected, and possessions thrown out illegally.  That\\'s according to YouGov research for housing charity Shelter, that found some 350,000 renters in the capital have suffered from landlords\\' unlawful behaviour, such as entering homes without permission and making threats.  Yet London\\'s housing capacity problems, and soaring rents, makes tenants more willing to tolerate bad landlords. So if a private landlord threatens you with eviction, enters your flat or house without asking consent, or discriminates against you, what can you do?  If you\\'ve been faced with eviction  First, check the threat is legal: landlords have to follow specific rules, especially for tenants with a fixed-term contract.  Most landlords will have to issue a Section 21 notice with two months\\' warning of eviction, and apply for a court order - they can\\'t just turn up at your door threatening eviction. Landlords also need to have placed your deposit in a government-backed tenancy deposit scheme. If not, their eviction efforts may be illegal.  If a mortgage lender is trying to evict you because the landlord has missed payments, there may still be a way out. If, for example, you were living in the property when the mortgage was granted, you may be able to avoid being evicted. If not, and the property is being repossessed, new rules allow you to delay this process by up to two months. Contact your local CAB (citizensadvice.org.uk) for help, or Shelter\\'s advice line on 0808 800 4444.  If your deposit isn\\'t protected  Any landlord offering an \"assured shorthold tenancy\" (the most common type) beginning after April 6, 2007,has to put the deposit into a government-backed tenancy deposit scheme.  If yours hasn\\'t done so, you can take the landlord to the small claims court to reclaim the deposit, and a penalty.  Landlords and harassment  Clearly there\\'s a difference between an annoying landlord with over-strict rules and a harassing one.  The latter disturbs or removes your belongings, cuts off your energy or water, is violent, or enters your home without permission. \"It could also be harassment if your landlord tries to take away your legal rights as a tenant,\" says Shelter.  If you are being harassed, keep written records or photos of incidents, ask them to contact you only in writing, and only see them with a witness.  Shelter advises that if their harassing behaviour continues even after you write them a complaint, write saying you will take legal action.  Contact your local council\\'s tenancy relations officer to speak to your landlord on your behalf. If you feel the council doesn\\'t deal with it properly, contact the Local Government Ombudsman (lgo.org.uk).',\n",

His responsibilities include the Horizon Asian Dividend Income Fund, available to Irish investors through RaboDirect. The minimum investment amount is ?100.  Philosophy The Horizon Asian Dividend Income Fund seeks to achieve an abovebenchmark dividend yield from a portfolio of Asian stocks with a focus on value and long-term capital appreciation.  The fund adopts a bottom-up investment strategy, picking stocks based on their individual attributes rather than the focusing on the wider macroeconomic environment.  \"We think dividend growth in Asia will be way in excess of developed markets,\" said Kerley. \"The fund is designed for people who want to diversify their income stream by looking at other parts of the world.\"  Performance The fund is up 13.1% over the past 12 months. Over five years it has risen by an average of 8.5% a year.  \"We aim for a higher dividend yield but with lower volatility, and I think we have managed to achieve that,\" said Kerley.  Buying and selling The fund had a broadly positive view on China\\'s A-share stock market, said Kerley, recently adding shares in China Yangtze Power.  \"The company owns and operates a dam on the Yangtze river which produces hydroelectric power,\" he said. \"The dam has been built and the company is now very cash flowgenerative. We think its dividend yield will grow in excess of 20% per annum over the next three years.\"  The fund has also added shares in bus maker Zhengzhou Yutong Bus.  \"Zhengzhou Yutong is the largest global producer of electric buses,\" said Kerley. \"Not only is there great demand for these buses in China, but they\\'re also being sold into Europe.\"  Kerley was also positive about the dividend prospects for Korean stocks. The fund recently added shares in Korean oil company SK Innovation, Korean bank KB Financial and utility company Korea Electric Power.  \"Korea was a bit like Japan in that it never really embraced dividends, but we think a real sea change is taking place,\" he said. \"The government is putting pressure on companies to increase dividend payouts, which we are starting to see.\"  The fund has sold holdings in Australian stocks such as energy utility company Duet and real estate investment trust Scentre Group. According to Kerley these companies had been overvalued, with investors bidding up their share prices in the chase for yield.  Outlook Having underperformed in recent years, Asia-Pacific equities are trading at a discount and are poised to re-rate, said Kerley.  \"After disappointing for the past three or four years, company earnings are recovering in Asia while valuations are at a decent discount relative to the rest of the world,\" he said.  Kerley is \"hugely positive\" about the dividend prospects of Asian companies.  \"Dividend payout ratios are a lot lower in Asia than in the rest of the world, so the potential for dividend growth is a very compelling,\" he said.',\n",
       " 'Student Loan Debt Has Minimal Impact on Retirement Savings Even though Americans are looking at record high student loan debt, graduates may be compensating through means other than cutting retirement saving, according to new research.  Americans are looking at record-high student loan debt. According to a study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, 70% of graduates have student loans averaging $30,000. In 1993, 47% of students graduated with loans averaging $10,000. This trend raises questions about how student loan debt is affecting retirement savings for employees and to what extend they may compensating by either cutting savings or consumption.  The CRR pursued some of these questions by focusing on 30-year-old working graduates in employer-sponsored retirement plans. However, the firm found that the estimated relationship between student loans and plan participation is small and \"statistically insignificant.\"\\xa0  CRR\\'s research indicates that the value of median retirement assets for participants with student debt at age 30 is $10,075 and the same for those without student loans is $10,680, according to a new report.The study also found that 55% of respondents with student loan debt are plan participants, while 42% of participants don\\'t have student loans.  Furthermore, the research indicates that individuals with larger loan balances are more likely to accept employer-sponsored retirement plans.  The CRR says, \"This lack of a relationship between student loans and retirement plan saving suggests that the detrimental effect of student debt manifests itself either through reduced consumption or other reductions in net worth, such as credit card debt.\"  According to their research, participants with student loans have higher levels of debt from other sources. The CRR points out that 30-year-old graduates with loans have median debt levels of $7,500. For those without student loans, the level is $3,000.  The research also examines student-loan holders who aren\\'t graduates.  The CRR reports that among non-graduates who attended college, those with student loans had a median non-student debt of $4,500 at age 30, compared to $1,750 for non-graduates without student loans. The research also found that 40% of respondents who have student debt but no degree are retirement plan participants, while 31% of non-degree holding respondents with student debt are not.  The median level of retirement assets for respondents with student loans and no degree is $5,874. The median level of retirement assets for those who attended college but have no student loans or degrees at age 30 is $7,252.  \"How Does Student Debt Affect Early-Career Retirement Saving\" by the CRR uses the \"National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort,\" a large sample of workers turning 30, which includes detailed controls including school quality, parental background, and the underlying ability of the college attendee. The CRR analysis focuses on participation in an employer-sponsored retirement plan and retirement assets as of age 30. It can be found online\\xa0here.  editors@plansponsor.com',\n",
       " 'Quasi-Testamentary Dispositions: A Lesson From The Insurance Act Few would be surprised to hear that Canada\\'s aging population has created challenges for many professionals, particularly those who do estate planning.  Recent changes to Ontario\\'s Insurance Act respond to some of those challenges and will be of interest to insurers, financial planners and insurance agents in Ontario. On July 1, 2016, amendments to sections 221 and 322 of the Insurance Act took effect. These amendments provide that where it appears to an insurer that a representative of a beneficiary who is a minor may accept payments on behalf of the beneficiary under the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary resides, the insurer may make payment to the representative and the payment discharges the insurer to the extent of the amount paid. Previously, these sections only applied to representatives of beneficiaries under legal incapacity. You can read a more in-depth review of the amendments here.  Sections 221 and 322 of the Insurance Act are important for two reasons:  In today\\'s globalized world, it is not uncommon for people who purchase insurance in Ontario to have beneficiaries elsewhere: e.g. an Ontario grandfather has designated his mentally incapable son in British Columbia and a minor granddaughter in New York as the beneficiaries of his life insurance. Under the amendments to the Insurance Act if the son has a guardian under British Columbia law, and the grand-daughter a custodian under New York State law, each of whom has the authority to accept payments, the insurer may pay the funds to the guardians and be discharged to the extent of the amount paid.  The Insurance Act provides clear direction on what is required by an insurer to obtain a discharge where benefits are to be paid out under a life and accident and sickness insurance policy.1 In contrast, the Succession Law Reform Act (\"SLRA\"), which governs the designation of beneficiaries to, among other things, RRSPs and RRIFs, does not offer the same guidance as the Insurance Act does for how payment to a beneficiary of a pension or RRSP is to be made upon the death of the plan participant. One can only hope that the SLRA will eventually be amended along the lines of the Insurance Act.  The Insurance Act is an excellent example of how well-crafted legislation can help facilitate payments to beneficiaries upon the death of the policy owner.

       " 'News Morrison softens stance on super rules Retirement savings Treasurer holds talks with Senate powerbrokers  Treasurer Scott Morrison has confirmed plans to water down some of the superannuation changes announced in the budget, but says he\\'ll hold the line on the most important elements.  Speaking on Macquarie Radio, Mr Morrison said while the proposed $500,000 lifetime cap on top-up contributions out of post-tax income would remain, he was prepared to write in exemptions for \"major life events\".  \"One of them, if you get a pay-out as a result of an accident or something like that, then that is exempted from the $500,000 cap,\" he said. \"If you have entered into a contract before budget night to settle on a property asset out of your self-managed super fund and you are using after-tax contributions to settle that contract - well, that won\\'t be included.\"  Other measures would be in the exposure draft of the legislation that would be released shortly.  Labor says it will oppose the $500,000 lifetime cap if it is found to be retrospective. But its superannuation spokesman, Jim Chalmers, says he will consider supporting it if an independent review finds in its favour.  Mr Morrison said he would be most unlikely to lift the $500,000 limit. \"I don\\'t know too many people out there who are sitting there with a bag of $500,000, which they want to put in their superannuation fund,\" he said. \"They are on higher incomes, have higher balances, have already benefited significantly from the generous tax contribution and other concessions, and the argument they are making is: \\'I want to put more in so I don\\'t have to pay as much tax as someone else is on those earnings\\'.  \"I am saying we should be getting rid of the Family Tax Benefit supplement payments every July, and that is to people who earn a lot less than those who are able to put half a million dollars after tax. How can I look them in the eye and at the same time say: \\'Oh no, I am going to protect this interest over here who is sitting on half a million bucks\\'.\"  Mr Morrison spoke with Senate powerbroker Nick Xenophon and his team in Adelaide last week and would be meeting with new senators Pauline Hanson and Derryn Hinch. He would impress on them that every savings measure the new Senate rejected would make it harder to retain Australia\\'s AAA credit rating and get the budget back in to surplus.  \"The facts of the Senate are that if Labor and the Greens are blocking government legislation then it only takes the Xenophon party or the One Nation party to side with Labor and the Greens and it is blocked,\" he said. \"Senators will be in a position where they really do have a balance of power. They won\\'t have the option to say that this is their view and move on.\"',\n",

Investments in mutual funds carry risks and investors may lose principal value. Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. It is important to remember that there are risks inherent in any investment and there is no assurance that any investment or asset class will provide positive performance over time. Value style investing presents the risk that the holdings or securities may never reach our estimate of intrinsic value because the market fails to recognize what the portfolio management team considers the true business value or because the portfolio management team has misjudged those values. In addition, value style investing may fall out of favor and underperform growth or other style investing during given periods. Non-U.S. investing presents additional risks, such as the potential for adverse political, currency, economic, social or regulatory developments in a country, including lack of liquidity, excessive taxation, and differing legal and accounting standards. Non-U.S. securities, including American Depository Receipts (ADRs) and other depository receipts, are also subject to interest rate and currency exchange rate risks.  Fixed income securities are subject to interest rate, inflation and credit risks. Lower rated bonds, convertible securities, and other types of debt obligations involve greater risks than higher rated bonds. Mortgage securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are subject to prepayment risk and the risk of default on the underlying mortgages or other assets; such derivatives may increase volatility. Convertible securities are generally not investment grade and are subject to greater credit risk than higher-rated investments. High yield securities can be volatile and subject to much higher instances of default.

       " 'BOE Policy Worsens Pension Funds\\' Headache --Update LONDON--The Bank of England\\'s interest-rate cut Thursday buoyed stock markets here, but for some big British corporations, the move--the central bank\\'s first rate cut in seven years--is likely to translate into widening pension shortfalls.  Many of the U.K.\\'s defined-benefit plans, which promise to pay out fixed benefits to retirees, have fallen deep into deficit. The value of contributions in many of the plans hasn\\'t kept up with expected outlays to pensioners in years to come. That is largely due to falling bond yields and lackluster returns in other markets such as equities. Retirees are also living longer.  The total gap in U.K. pension funds stood at roughly GBP850 billion ($1.13 trillion) before Thursday\\'s rate cut, according to pensions consultancy Hymans Robertson. That is expected to widen after the BOE\\'s rate cut Thursday.  A slew of British companies report pension deficits on their balance sheets. As of June 30, BT Group PLC, for example, reported pension liabilities of GBP52.8 billion and a deficit of GBP7.6 billion, wider than the GBP6.4 billion deficit it reported as of March 31. BT declined to comment on any potential impact to its pension plans from U.K. monetary policy.  The BOE\\'s move on Thursday to lower its benchmark rate to 0.25% from 0.5%, its lowest lending rate ever, will make it even harder to make the sort of returns needed to put those plans back in balance. The central bank also said it would buy up government and corporate bonds, a maneuver aimed at keeping long-term rates low.  The measures will put pension schemes under even greater pressure and the impact of quantitative easing on gilt yields will be an additional burden for many schemes already struggling, the U.K. Pensions and Lifetimes Savings Association said.  \"While we recognize the need to protect the U.K. economy, strong consideration needs to be given to the negative impact this will have on the 6,000 private defined-benefit pension schemes helping some 11 million savers,\" the association said.  \"Major losses for pension funds are very real possibilities\" in the wake of the rate cut, said Daniel Mahoney, analyst at the Centre for Policy Studies, a think tank.  Many funds hold bonds, including large holdings of U.K. government bonds, or gilts, and have in the past depended on their yield to help sustain payouts.  \"Pension funds hold a disproportionate number of gilts, and they are going to get hammered,\" he said.  Companies \"could be in for a bit for a rough ride,\" said Hymans Robertson consultant Calum Cooper.  The cut threatens to leave companies \"with a sense of running to stand still,\" said Raj Mody, pensions consultant at auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers.  Ian Walker contributed to this article.

       " 'Money Using comparison sites have made car insurance MORE expensive Car insurance costs are rising - fast - and this time insurers are saying it\\'s because we have the temerity to actually compare prices before buying  The growing tendency for people to shop around for their car insurance is actually helping to push the cost of the cover they are offered up, according to an index.  The rising numbers of car owners actively hunting out the cheapest deal every year means there is now less incentive for firms to offer motorists introductory loss-making insurance prices - as customers have become less likely to simply stick with their existing firm when the introductory price ends - according to the report from the AA.  The typical quote for someone shopping around for a comprehensive policy in the second quarter of 2016 has increased by around £12.50 compared with the first three months of the year and around £84 compared with a year earlier.  On average, comprehensive car insurance cover now costs £568, according to the figures from the AA\\'s insurance premium index.  Car insurance costs accelerate again - this is how to fight them  Looking at what is behind the increases, Michael Lloyd, director of insurance at the AA, said: \"Increasing numbers of car owners shop around for their cover every year, especially at a time when premiums are going up.  \"As more people look for introductory offers there is less incentive for companies to offer loss-making prices to attract new business that will, a year later, go elsewhere. So I believe this is one driver of recent premium increases while insurers are looking for ways to better reward customer loyalty.\"  Collateral lies: How a Supreme Court ruling means you might still get a payout even if your insurance claim contained falsehoods  Looking across the UK, the AA said Northern Ireland has seen the biggest increase in car insurance premiums over the last quarter, with a 7.8% increase taking the average shoparound premium there to £804, making it the most expensive place to insure a car.  The cheapest place to get car insurance is Scotland, where the average shoparound premium is £404, marking a 2.5% quarterly increase.  In Wales, the average premium is now £514, having increased by 3% over the quarter.  The shoparound quoted premium is an average of the five cheapest premiums that a customer might expect to get. Prices are taken from both direct and price comparison site markets.  Young drivers aged 17 to 22 years old, who already pay the highest premiums of any age group, saw the biggest jump in the cost of their cover over the last quarter, with 3.5% or £42 added to a policy, taking the average cost to around £1,240.  Drivers aged over 70 saw the smallest quarterly increase, with a 1.2% upswing taking their average premium to £452.

       " 'Business Make sure you have enough for retirement; A good savings method? Plan as though you\\'ll live to age 90, says financial planner TORONTO -- When people picture retirement, they may envision lying on a sandy beach with a drink in hand or teeing off on a breathtaking golf course in Hawaii.  What they usually don\\'t consider is struggling to pay the bills.  So how do you ensure you have enough money saved for the retirement of your dreams when you don\\'t know how long you will live?  The wisest advice, according to financial experts, is to budget conservatively because it\\'s always better to have some money when you die than no money while you\\'re still alive.  \"Most people are living longer than their parents and their grandparents did,\" said John De Goey, a certified financial planner and portfolio manager at Industrial Alliance Securities. \"A good baseline is that you need to plan to live until age 90.\"  There are several factors that could also affect life expectancy, such as a family history of health problems and one\\'s gender. On average, women tend to live longer than men so they should plan on living a few years past 90, whereas men might be able to get away with planning on living a few years less.  But how much money do people actually need to save?  De Goey says retirees should look at saving about 50 per cent of their annual income in their final year of work, with the funds coming from a variety of sources including cash, investments, Old Age Security, pensions.  If someone has an annual salary of $80,000 a year while working, they should aim to have $40,000 a year for every year of retirement. If they retire at age 65, and live until 90, then they should have a nest egg of $1 million.  Of course, that goal can vary due to a number of factors. Is there still a mortgage or rent to pay? Do you plan on a lot of travelling? Eating out?  De Goey says the easiest way to ensure people have enough money for whatever retirement they plan for is to work longer.  \"There are two benefits of working longer. Number one, you\\'re hopefully able to save a proportion of what you earn, and two, because you\\'re working, you\\'re not drawing on your savings,\" he said.  \"So even if you are saving only five to 10 per cent of your salary in your mid-60s, you\\'re also foregoing withdrawing that money from your nest egg. The combination of those two things greatly enhances the likelihood that you\\'ll still have money left when your life is still in the bottom years.\"  Most of his clients balk at the idea of having to stay at their jobs in their senior years. But De Goey notes that because general life expectancy is rising, the amount of retirement years can remain the same.',\n",

       " 'Money Former BHS boss Sir Philip Green spent more on his super yacht than he invested into failed store FORMER BHS tycoon Sir Philip Green lavished more on his latest yacht than on the failed chain\\'s stores in his last five years in charge.  The billionaire forked out £100million on the 300ft vessel Lionheart.  His third luxury yacht, it has four storeys, a swimming pool, helipad and beauty salon and was delivered to him this week in the Mediterranean.  The retail tycoon told MPs in a letter that was published yesterday that he spent £96.2 million on 163 BHS stores between 2009 and 2014. In the final two years of his ownership of the chain, he spent just £10 million.  However Sir Philip was not always so penny-pinching with the high street stalwart. During 2004 and 2009, he invested £254 million, according to the letter which was sent from Sir Philip to the chairs of the Business and Work and Pensions Committees, who are looking into the circumstances surrounding the collapse of BHS.  Sir Philip has been criticised for allowing BHS stores to become rundown and dilapidated before selling the business, essentially contributing to attempts to turn around the chain.  Revelations of the sums he paid into the retail group came days after the Top Shop owner took delivery of a £100 million superyacht in the Mediterranean. The Lionheart yacht took four years to build, is four storeys high and the length of a football pitch.  The boat is Sir Philip\\'s third luxury yacht and is understood to have a hot tub, swimming pool, helipad and beauty salon.  Work and Pensions Committee chairman Frank Field suggested that Sir Philip was making a last-ditch attempt to influence his committee\\'s report on the collapse of BHS.  Mr Field said: \"Sir Philip is aware we are writing our report and is suddenly volunteering all manner of last-minute assistance.\"  Sir Philip\\'s reputation has taken a battering since BHS collapsed in April, leaving behind a £571 million pension deficit and putting 11,000 jobs at risk.  The billionaire, who owned the retailer for 15 years until 2015, has come under fire for taking £400 million in dividends from the company and then selling it to former bankrupt Dominic Chappell for £1.  In the letter to MPs, Sir Philip also insists that he tried to support a Sports Direct rescue deal for BHS.  He claims he offered to add £5 million to the £10 million offered by Mike Ashley\\'s Sports Direct for BHS, although Mr Ashley\\'s bid was rejected by administrators as unacceptable.  This \"can now put an end to the suggestion that I tried to block a sale of the business\", Green wrote to MPs probing the collapse.  \"It is clear that we invested substantially in the business, we lent substantial sums to the business and we gave Retail Acquisitions every chance with a solid platform to take the business forward,\" Green wrote.',\n",
       " 'News & Advice Summer holiday essentials: airport hotels and parking Everything you need to know, every day this week  One reason speculators invest in airport hotels is to capitalise on delays and disruption. But to boost occupancy, proprietors offer good deals for travellers with early flights.  Location is very important. At the UK\\'s main holiday airport, Gatwick, the ideal hotel for North Terminal is the Sofitel (sofitel.com), and for the South Terminal it is Bloc (blochotels.com/gatwick), located just before the security gate with pod-style rooms in a variety of categories, including for families. There\\'s also a branch of Yotel located close to arrivals (yotel.com).Stansted\\'s Radisson Bluis a short walk from check-in (radissonblu.com).  You will pay a premium to stay at these properties compared with \"off airport\" locations. But crafty travellers could try the Arora in Crawley, which is right next to a railway station with four trains an hour to Gatwick, taking eight minutes to South Terminal (gatwick.arorahotels.com). The Ibis at Luton is a 10-minute walk from the airport (ibis.com).  Hotels in the Heathrow area have no conventional shuttle buses, but a \"Heathrow Hoppa\" that runs as infrequently as once an hour and charges £4.50 for the privilege (nationalexpress.com); if you are flying from Terminal 5, the Sofitel is by far the best bet.  Read more  Summer holiday essentials: passports  Summer holiday essentials: airport lounges  Summer holiday essentials: airline baggage allowances and fees  Summer holiday essentials: how to keep children entertained on long journeys  Holidayextras.co.uk is a good source of airport hotel bargains, especially the \"Mystery Hotel\" feature. Familiar hotel brands protect their core revenue by selling some rooms through intermediaries who undertake not to name them until the booking is made. Next week, for example, you could find yourself staying at \"A four-star hotel linked to Gatwick\\'s North Terminal\" for £95 per double room only, compared to £120 at the Sofitel North Terminal.  The website also includes parking-inclusive accommodation packages. Parking is a very strong incentive, because many hotels will throw in a week or two when you take a room before or after your flight. For example, book a night at the Holiday Inn near Edinburgh airport next week and you\\'ll get a week\\'s parking included for £159. The hotel has a pool and two restaurants and is around a three-minute transfer (with shuttles running every 10 minutes) from the airport.  Parking could be a boon at airports such as Gatwick, which is currently operating a revised train timetable, with fewer services running to the Sussex airport as a result of an ongoing industrial dispute between parent firm Govia Thameslink and the RMT union. Recently, services have been subject to frequent delays and cancellations.  Finally, always book parking in advance and shop around on price comparison sites before committing to booking. It\\'s also worth checking transfer times to the terminal, security and cancellation policies.',\n",
       " 'Commentary Individual purpose and world change Many Millennials have a sincere desire to contribute fresh ideas to solve a variety of world problems, as is seen in this week\\'s cover story. According to the article, they also want to positively contribute to changing the status quo on a global level, and find a sense of personal balance and professional purpose - but paying off student loans, overcoming stereotypes, and finding right opportunities for their talents are proving challenging to overcome.  These are challenges I can relate to. I loved international relations, spent time overseas, and obtained a college degree in that field. I considered myself a global citizen, and wanted to help develop solutions to challenges in the world.  However, when I graduated from college, global dynamics had changed so that there were no longer substantial jobs for people with my background. I was grateful for the job I had, but it didn\\'t provide opportunities for professional growth. I knew I wanted to go to graduate school, but wasn\\'t sure what subject to focus on that would lead to a satisfying career that could enable me to pay off my student loans. I felt overwhelmed with decisions and afraid of making a mistake. So I prayed for guidance.  I was inspired by what Christ Jesus said about how our needs are met: \"Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you\" (Matthew 6:33). This brought to mind a list of qualities belonging to the kingdom of heaven that Mary Baker Eddy, the discoverer of Christian Science, wrote: \"unselfishness, goodness, mercy, justice, health, holiness, love\" (\"Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures,\" p. 248).  As I thought deeply about these, I realized that my desire to help others and solve world problems needed to begin with a deeper understanding of God and my relationship to Him. I needed to see that God cares for His creation - including you and me - and that as His children, we are truly made to be fresh and complete, not limited by human qualifiers or requirements.  Gaining this broader sense of the kingdom of heaven gave me a better sense of who God is in relation to His creation, and it gave me a better sense of purpose. I understood that living unselfishly, expressing \"goodness, mercy, justice, health, holiness, love,\" was my true life purpose. And living in this way provides us with practical opportunities to fulfill this purpose.  As I focused my prayer this way, the feelings of being overwhelmed were replaced by joy, confidence, and clarity in applying for graduate school. I later found fulfilling employment that allowed me to pay back my loans and, more important, seemed to make a positive difference in government.  This experience showed me that starting with the kingdom of heaven guides us, giving us ideas for each stage of our lives, enabling us to do good in the world.',\n",
       " \"Real Estate Eight of Connecticut's Thimble Islands List for $78 Million; Off the coast of Branford, Conn., the portfolio owned by Christine and Edmund Stoecklein includes many houses and a Jack Nicklaus-designed putting green Corrections & Amplifications:  Potato Island is roughly 1 acre and is listed for $6.5 million. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it was 11 acres and listed for $7.35 million. (07/01/2016)  After spending years collecting a cluster of small islands off the Connecticut coast, a wealthy family has decided to put eight of the rocky islands on the market for $78 million.  Located in the Thimble Islands archipelago in Long Island Sound off the coast of Branford, nearly all of the islands for sale have homes on them, according to Shelly Tretter Lynch of Sotheby's International Realty, one of the listing agents.  The largest, Rogers Island, is about 8 acres and includes a roughly 13,000-square-foot, 10-bedroom restored house built around 1900 as well as a swimming pool, a tennis court and a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf putting green and tees. Reachable by a 5- to 10- minute boat ride, the island also contains a four-bedroom guesthouse, an artist's studio, two piers and a greenhouse.  The other islands for sale range from tiny undeveloped Reel Island to the roughly .8-acre Wheeler Island, which has an eight-bedroom house. A pedestrian bridge connects the East and West portions of Cut-in-Two Island, each of which has a house and guesthouse. The sale price also includes a 2.32-acre waterfront property on the mainland containing several houses and a private dock for boats traveling to and from the islands.  The properties are owned by Christine and Edmund Stoecklein. Ms. Stoecklein has spent years acquiring islands in the area: Her former husband John Svenningsen, founder of the party supplies company Amscan Holdings, purchased West Crib Island in the 1970s. After his death in 1997, she began buying up other islands, including Rogers Island in 2003 for $22.3 million, a record-setting price for the Thimbles. In total she spent more than $30 million to buy the islands, then spent millions more on renovations, infrastructure and landscaping, according to co-listing agent Bill Fandel of Telluride Sotheby's International Realty.  The Stoeckleins use the islands to house friends and family in the summer, Mr. Fandel said, but they recently bought a home in Washington state, where they plan to spend more time. The family is selling all of the islands except West Crib, the first one they owned, he said.  In 2012 Ms. Stoecklein briefly listed two of the islands; they were removed from the market after failing to sell, and they've received further upgrades since then, Mr. Fandel said.  There are about 80 houses among the Thimble Islands, which became popular as a summer resort area in the late 19th century. It is difficult to price the islands because they rarely change hands, the listing agents said. Potato Island, which isn't owned by the Stoeckleins, spans about 1 acre and is currently listed for $6.5 million.  Write to Candace Taylor at Candace.Taylor@wsj.com\",\n",
       " 'Gen Y told to think strategically to get on property ladder Desperate Gen Y home buyers struggling with the lack of \\'affordable\\' housing in Auckland\\'s upmarket city-fringe suburbs are being advised to form a unified consortium to get a foothold on the city\\'s housing ladder.  Real estate agent Jock Kooger said long-time home owners in Auckland had considerable empathy with the wave of 20 and 30-somethings concerned about how they were struggling to buy entry level property in suburbs such as Ponsonby, Grey Lynn, Mt Eden, Mt Albert and Parnell.  \"There\\'s a mature age group in Auckland, and it\\'s a sizeable population, who fret for the plight of that Gen Y age bracket,\" said Mr Kooger.  \"The baby boomer generation has a well-grounded message for the Gen Y ers: \\'Change your expectations, face up to reality, and accept that if you want to buy an entry-level property in one of Auckland\\'s most expensive suburbs then you\\'ll most likely have to make compromises.\"  Mr Kooger said he had just listed a block of 12 flats in the leafy suburb of Herne Bay, a mere 1.5 kilometres or 15 minute walk from the heart of Auckland CBD. The block of 12 flats in Sentinel Road comprises four two-bedroom dwellings, eight one-bedroom units, and a smaller studio unit previously operated as the caretaker\\'s residence. All of the flats were on their own individual ownership title - meaning they could be sold off separately.  Mr Kooger said the most likely buyer demographic for the entire block was an investor who would reap the benefits of owning a rental portfolio in a high-demand part of the city with its close proximity to not only the city, but also the hospitality hub of Ponsonby Road.  \"However, there is the opportunity for a consortium of like-minded young professionals to entering the property market. So for all those Gen Y ers who say they keep on being priced out of the market in this area, this is a brilliant opportunity to take advantage of a unique piece of real estate,\" Mr Kooger said.  \"So for around the same individual investment, they can look at buying an apartment in town, buying a do-up on the urban fringes, or look at getting organised with a group of similar budding home owners in the same proverbial \\'boat\\', and putting in an offer on Herne Bay.\"  Mr Kooger said it would be easy enough for any tech-savvy Gen Y mobile phone user to set up a Facebook page and establish a consortium of other buyers to put in a combined offer for the Sentinel Road flats.  \"The vendor has indicated he is happy to help out struggling first home buyers, and would certainly consider a consortium-style offer from a large group. He knows what they are going through, and is patiently aware of the intricacies that would come with a multi-buyer offer,\" Mr Kooger said.',\n",
       " \"Money Delicious elderflower recipes for drinks and treats on a budget Elderflowers are in bloom everywhere - and you can pick them for free. Here's how to turn them into something special  Elderflower season is in full swing, and once you know what you are looking for, it seems like it the frothy white heads of the flowers of peaking out of every hedgerow.  With the addition of a bag of sugar and a couple of lemons, you can preserve the taste of summer by creating a cordial that you can use throughout the year.  First up, for anyone wondering how to find elderflower, this is what you are looking for:  And once you know what you are looking for, you will see it everywhere.  Local parks, playing fields and churchyards are good places to scout out, but it pretty much grows anywhere.  If possible, avoid the ones that are growing by the side of the roads, as they will be covered in exhaust fumes and dirt from the cars and lorries. Not quite the taste of summer we are aiming for.  You should also make sure to chop off the stalks, as these contain chemicals that could make you sick.  Here is a really good basic recipe for elderflower cordial from River Cottage that makes about two litres.  And you can also make a really simple elderflower tea too, that is packed full of anti-oxidants and very good for you.  If you are looking for alcoholic options, then you can make elderflower wine, or a fizzy version (and pretend it's champagne).   If you do go the trouble (and it really isn't a cast amount of trouble) of making your own cordial, here are some delicious ways to make sure every last drop is used up:  If you have an allotment, or a strawberry patch in your garden, then this is a great way to use up all the strawberries before they go mushy or get munched by the slugs.  This is a super thrifty recipe if you have made your own elderflower cordial. The only other ingredient is egg whites, which you may well even has leftovers after making something else that needed egg yolks.  Homemade biscuits that taste of summer - these would make a great gift for a summer birthday, or as a thank you present for teachers at the end of term.  If you still have any of your cordial left as the summer starts to wane, you can use it up along with any windfall cooking apples to make a delicious pudding.  I made this a couple of years ago, and seeing the recipe again now has reminded me to make it again. It was based on an elderflower and coconut cake, but I substituted ground almonds instead.

       " 'NEWS Don\\'t blame Boomers for savings shortfall As Baby Boomers enter their traditional retirement years, many are faced with not only less in savings than they would like or need, but also annoying public lectures from experts and politicians about how it\\'s all their fault. Public service announcements tell Boomers and younger generations that they need to stop wasting money on life\\'s little pleasures now and save more for tomorrow. Politicians tell them they need to work until age 69 or more to receive Social Security pensions because they are living longer than the government planned for.  Saving is an important part of retirement planning. However, these admonitions commit the ultimate attribution error: blaming individuals without taking into account the situation. The contributing factors outside of their control are ignored.  The economy increasingly has relied on a contingent workforce of part-time, contract and temporary employees. Along with layoffs, downsizing and frequent job changes, it\\'s no wonder Boomers are less likely than earlier generations to have company-paid vested pensions or even 401(k) employer contributions.  Sometimes, companies laid off workers or closed just before employee pensions would have been vested. Stagnant or lower wages, high individual health insurance premiums and increased job insecurity over this period have also made it more difficult for workers to set aside money for a distant future while still getting by in the immediate present.  As a Boomer myself, I have experienced some of this.  Like Prince William and Malia Obama, I took a \"gap\" year before entering college. In fact, I took two. Those years at a large corporation gave me work experience and some opportunities to travel but resulted in no vested retirement benefits.  Much later, a cancer diagnosis redirected my income toward treatment costs not covered by my insurance. Cancer had a way of forcing the focus away from a distant retirement that might never happen toward the here and now of basic survival. I know I am likely to live long enough to retire, but I also realize it will not be at 65, the traditional retirement age of my parents.  Approaching that onetime milestone, the Baby Boomer runs up against the reality of older age requirements for Social Security -- 66 or 67 to get full benefits, 70 for the maximum monthly amount.  He also finds himself in a work world of ageism, underemployment that drives the effective unemployment rate up to nearly 10%, and a diminished supply of full-time high-paying jobs with benefits -- all trends accelerated and intensified by the Great Recession and its massive layoffs.  It has become a gig economy, and a toxic one at that. The situations Boomers have had to face in this changing economy, and the decisions they made at each step along the way, have conspired to leave even frugal, debt-free savers with smaller retirement nest eggs than they need.

       " 'Pensions Back in favour: Is SSAS the new SIPP? Once upon a time, there was a small self-administered pension scheme (SSAS) that was the vehicle of choice for many small companies that wished to take advantage of greater investment flexibilities than those afforded to other company pensions, most notably loanbacks to the sponsoring employer.  During the late 1990s the SSAS fell out of favour with many companies swept away by the exciting new kids on the block; group personal pensions (GPPs) and self-invested personal pensions (SIPPs).  However, in recent times, there appears to have been a resurgence in SSAS as regulatory pressures bite on SIPP operators and the requirement to categorise assets as either standard or non-standard.  So as an adviser why might you consider a SSAS over a SIPP for your clients? The table below highlights the key features of each vehicle.  Each of the scheme structures has its own advantages and disadvantages and these are summarised here:  One of the key advantages to opening a SSAS in favour of a SIPP is the ability for the pension scheme to loan funds back to the sponsoring employer - an advantage highlighted above. This is a particularly important advantage to the employer given the current lack of economic stimulus and the reluctance of high street banks to arrange financing on reasonably commercial terms.  As might be expected, HMRC has set relevant criteria for the loan to be acceptable and these are explored in turn. The criteria relates to:  * The maximum amount of the loan  * The term of the loan  * Interest rates  * Repayment terms  * Security  Maximum amount of loan  The maximum the loan can be is of 50% of the net assets of the Scheme.  Term of the loan  The term of the loan cannot ordinarily be longer than five years from the date the loan is first made.  Interest rates  A commercial rate of interest must be charged on any loans granted.  Repayment terms  The rules state that any loan must be paid in equal instalments of both capital and interest akin to the terms under a standard repayment mortgage.  Security  Any loan granted to the employer must be secured by a first charge against any asset owned by the sponsoring employer (or other person). The value of that security must be at least equal to the value of the loan and any interest due over the term. It is of course worth pointing out that whilst the provision of a loan affords an employer extra flexibility, there are tax consequences should the rules not be followed.  And so the benefits of SSAS are real and make a great deal of sense to many employers. So at your next client meeting why not consider a SSAS as a valid alternative to the more widely used SIPP.

The biggest concerns are over rising prices, job losses and changes to workers protection according to the latest Disposable Income Index from Scottish Friendly.  Despite a £95 increase in monthly disposable income in May, compared to February this year, Brits are anxious about unexpected higher bills and external economic shocks.  The quarterly report, compiled with leading think-tank the Social Market Foundation, shows median disposable income has risen from £905 to £1,000 and this is due to continued low rates of inflation, the introduction of the National Living Wage and moderate pay growth in the private sector.

The 35 to 44 age group are one of the most squeezed with just £825 left each month, just less than the £831 that 25-34 year-olds have.  How age affects your income  People in Northern Ireland are the worst off with an average £749 after paying their bills, closely followed by those in the North East at £891. Meanwhile those in East England have the most in the pockets at £1,143.

A looming Brexit is leaving many worried as two-fifths fear it will cause prices to rise, more than a quarter think it could lead to job losses, while a fifth think job protections such as paid holiday and maternity leave could be affected.  The EU Referendum and your money  Calum Bennie, savings expert at Scottish Friendly, said: \"It\\'s encouraging to see the median level of disposbale inocme increase this quarter. The introduction of the National Living Wage is clearly a positive step and that, combine with low inflation and moderate wage growth has helped certain sections of society to have more money in their pockets at the end of the month.  \"However, our study continues to suggest that people are feeling financially fragile. Worries persist about preparedness for unexpected bills and debt.

With many travelers using online home-sharing sites to book a place to stay, the Department of Revenue is reminding homeowners to report the income and register, collect and remit the state\\'s 6 percent hotel occupancy tax.  \"Thousands of travelers visit Pennsylvania each year to enjoy our historic sites, great outdoors and vibrant celebrations and they are increasingly using online home-sharing agencies to rent a room or an entire house for a short-term stay,\" said Revenue Secretary Eileen McNulty. \"It is important for those property owners to understand their responsibility to register, collect and remit the state\\'s hotel occupancy tax.\"  Under state law, renting out sleeping accommodations for less than 30 days is a hotel rental and the state\\'s 6 percent hotel occupancy tax applies. Homeowners should also report income from home-sharing rentals with their Personal Income Tax Return, using Schedule C, Profit or Loss from Business or Profession.  To collect the hotel occupancy tax, property owners must first register with the Department of Revenue for a Sales, Use and Hotel Occupancy Tax License by completing and submitting Form PA-100. The form is online at www.pa100.state.pa.us.  After registering and obtaining a license and account number, property owners must create a separate account with e-TIDES, the department\\'s easy-to-use online system for filing business tax returns and making payments, including the hotel occupancy tax.  In addition to the state\\'s hotel occupancy tax, the department collects a 1 percent local hotel tax in Philadelphia and Allegheny County. Additional hotel tax imposed by counties is collected by county treasurers where it applies.  The department is helping homeowners who are unaware of their responsibility to collect the state hotel occupancy tax. In recent months more than 2,500 letters have been sent to property owners using home-sharing sites with instructions to complete a questionnaire to determine if the hotel occupancy tax applies. Homeowners have the opportunity to remit past-due tax and interest without penalty.  Property owners needing assistance registering for a Sales, Use and Hotel Occupancy Tax License using the Online PA-100 portal should contact the Department of Revenue at 717-787-1064.

       " 'Most Age-Based 529s Courting Market Timing Risk Age-based portfolios are growing in popularity among 529 college-savings plans. These portfolios operate similarly to target-date retirement funds in that they become less equity-heavy over time. But as a new Morningstar report points out, 80 percent of age-based portfolios use a static approach, which makes allocation changes abruptly, often with double-digit percentage-point changes in a single day. This approach can result in significant market risk. \"The Aggressive age-based tracks from the Kansas American Century advisor- and direct-sold plans stand as one of the more egregious examples of this; between age 17 and 18, management shifts assets from a 50 percent equity portfolio to a 0 percent equity allocation portfolio in one day,\" writes Janet Yang, Morningstar director.   \"Not only does that subject half the portfolio\\'s value to whatever may be happening on the rebalancing day, it does so when asset levels should be at or near their peaks.\" That\\'s why Yang strongly prefers funds that take a smoother, more progressive approach down the glide path. Bigger steps lead to a wider range of outcomes, on the downside and the upside.    What Happens When Women Are on the Board  Having a larger share of female directors on the board of public companies has been linked to those firms doing fewer mergers and acquisitions, according to a Notre Dame study reported in the Washington Post. The researchers looked at nearly 3,000 acquisitions in the U.S. between 1998 and 2010; firms that added female directors, going from zero to two, dropped their M&A rate by an average 18 percent, they found, and spent an average $97.2 million less on that activity. \"These findings could be interpreted in at least two ways,\" the Post reported. \"Perhaps women, often stereotyped as the gentler, more risk-averse gender, dampened company productivity with their trigger-shyness. Or, because roughly half of mergers and acquisitions end poorly, they knocked some business sense into male colleagues.\" The researchers suspect that any diversity on a corporate board would have similar outcomes, as diversity can break up \"groupthink\" and add to more \"thorough and deliberate evaluations\" of risk in making acquisitions.

       " 'RealEstate Do this to tee up sale The best way to sell your property is to get the marketing right first time, but don\\'t forget to have a plan B Having made a career from helping vendors sell \"the unsellable\", my first question to any vendor centres on the length of the sale process to date.  It\\'s not just about where the property is located, or what it is, or even if the said seller possesses good taste in cushions. Once the question is answered, I try to find the typical days quoted to sell a home in a particular location and price band. This establishes the selling-time benchmark, which should be referred to before \"selling panic\" sets in.  If you live in any of the 10 quickest-selling suburbs listed by REA (realestate.com.au owner) and you\\'ve been trying to sell for only a month, there could actually be cause to panic.  This data is great news for would-be vendors in these suburbs - one stunner is Wyoming in New South Wales, where 163 sales were recorded after a tiny average of 16 days for sale.  Just to make the rest of us feel better, these suburbs will not always be at the top. Anyway, there is nothing more frustrating than to see your listing languishing on the market. So here are my top survival tips to minimise the pain.  My first tip is price-related and involves being realistic with expectations. Whether you are disclosing a figure for marketing, going to auction, or seeking private sale, in most cases I see the figure is not in line with market expectations. This can prolong a transaction.  Tip two is to be market ready. Prepare for the sale by cleaning, de-cluttering and ensuring paperwork is in place (approvals, warranties, etc). You must know the local market and be fully aware of the competition. Research online, in the papers and property magazines, to find what homes like yours offer in terms of value, presentation and specification. It is not always necessary to upgrade kitchens and bathrooms. If you do need to undertake improvements, this process should indicate how drastic they need be.  The third tip is that selling is all about attracting buyer interest. You may only need one buyer, but the most successful sales always have more. Competition for the home places the vendor in a strong position.  Finally, one selling strategy does not fit all. Agents with a standard campaign may be successful, but what if your home is a little different? You need creative campaigns and alternative strategies if the first attempt does not work. Varying images/text and marketing mediums is key, as is keeping a campaign fresh.To recap: get to know the typical time it takes to sell a home like yours from the start; acknowledge market value; prepare the sale to meet local market preferences and expect a genuine marketing strategy, with a plan B in place from day one.',\n",

Among other things, Stull, Stull & Brody is investigating whether fiduciaries of Target\\'s 401(k) plan violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") by offering Target stock as an investment option under the plan when it was not prudent to do so and by failing to disclose the Company\\'s true financial and operating condition to participants and beneficiaries of the plan.

The securities fraud action alleges that Target failed to disclose the following facts: (a) at the time of the opening of its stores in Canada, it had significant problems with its supply chain infrastructure, distribution centers, and technology systems; (b) these problems caused significant issues, including excess inventory at distribution centers and inadequate inventory at retail locations; (c) this excess inventory at distribution centers and lack of inventory at retail locations forced Target to heavily discount products, incurring heavy losses; (d) these supply-chain and personnel problems were atypical of newly launched locations in Target\\'s traditional U.S.-based market; (e) as a result, statements about Target, its financial condition, and the outlook for its business lacked a reasonable basis.

Photo: Glenn Hunt  Investors\\' endless thirst for income could land them in hot water as they flock to riskier assets to boost returns. And it\\'s a trend that needs to stop if they want long- term yield. That is the view of Brad Cooper, chief executive of one of Australia\\'s biggest wealth management houses, BT Financial Group. The Westpac Banking Corp-owned wealth group warned investors were ignoring equity risk as they seek dividend-paying stocks and shun traditional income-producing asset classes such as fixed income. \"Whenever somebody is chasing higher yield, often what they should do is substitute yield for risk and see if that\\'s still comfortable,\" Mr Cooper said. \"People should look at how much capital they have at risk, how much capital they\\'re prepared to risk, and then take a view on yield. What I would advocate is a more balanced portfolio in this period of time.\" Research by Investment Trends found that 34 per cent of investors say their top goal in 2016 is to \"maximise income\", but record low interest rates make cash and term deposits unattractive. Around one out of three investors is looking to pour money into equities markets this year.  But many have seen their investments, even in blue-chip stocks, plummet after the benchmark S&P/ASX 200 fell 10 per cent during the past year. \"I think it\\'s going to remain volatile,\" Mr Cooper said about market returns for 2016. \"[With] an election period over the next couple of months, this [volatility] is going to be with us for at least the remainder of 2016.\" Mr Cooper\\'s comments come as BT Financial Group reported $452  million in cash earnings for the half year to March 31, which is flat from the same time last year. The group\\'s parent company posted a 3 per cent hike in half-year profits to $3.9 billion, as the bank reported more bad loans in its institutional lending arm. The result is softer than expected, and Westpac said its institutional lending business was hit by \"significantly higher\" impairment charges because of four major customers, which added $252  million to its bad-debt charge. BT\\'s results were 2 per cent lower than the six months to September. Mr Cooper said market volatility key to chipping at BT\\'s figures this half. \"We continued to see good flows into FUM [funds under management] and FUA [funds under advice], and we have also seen a positive performance in private wealth and the continued expansion of our insurance portfolio,\" he said.  77697120',\n",

Former England footballer and Match of the Day presenter Lineker - recently divorced from his second wife Danielle Bux - said lawyers try to manipulate the divorce process to make people spend more money and consequently create \"hate\" between parties involved.  He also called for the process of divorce settlements to be simplified to a \\'mathematical equation\\' after Lineker and Miss Bux used a government website to formalise their split and save on legal fees.  Charlie Bell, a senior lawyer at Vardags which has an office on the eighth floor of the Grade II Listed Ship Canal House on King Street, said \\'it\\'s the system, rather than we as lawyers, which encourages animosity between separating couples\\'.  \"To an extent, it is the system which makes it difficult for couples to split, amicably or otherwise.  \"A mathematical formula, as suggested by Gary Lineker, would give clarity to the general public as to the financial consequences of divorcing. However, it is difficult to imagine how such a \\'one size fits all\\' approach can produce an outcome that is fair in every case.\"  Charlie, who has acted for and against heirs and heiresses, tycoons, international footballers, celebrities and royalty in big-ticket financial and associated divorce cases, said there probably isn\\'t a perfect system, but there \\'has to be a better one\\'.

But it is true that many people come out of a divorce feeling bitter about the process, the cost and their former spouse. \"  He added: \"The Matrimonial Causes Act, which governs the distribution of assets upon divorce, received royal assent in 1973, 43 years ago.  \"The judiciary have, to some extent, endeavoured to move the law forwards to reflect the times that we now live in.

       " '17 Famous People Who Died Without A Will 17 Famous People Who Died Without A Will  Prince Rogers Nelson (better known as Prince) made headlines recently when his sister filed documents claiming that the entertainer died without a will. As hard as that might be to believe, it\\'s not all that unusual. According to a 2015 Rocket Lawyer survey, 64% of Americans don\\'t have a will. Not surprisingly, the number is higher for younger Americans (70% those aged 45-54) than for older Americans (54% those aged 55-64 do not have a Will). Prince was 57.  Of those surveyed without a will, most (60%) indicated they simply haven\\'t gotten around to making one yet while just over a quarter (27%) don\\'t feel that it\\'s urgent. Why put it off? It\\'s depressing for one: folks don\\'t like to think about wills because it forces them to think about their own death. It\\'s also viewed as costly: people believe that lawyers are expensive and those same folks often underestimate the value of their assets, thinking that they don\\'t have much to distribute.  Typically, a will spells out who will serve as the executor as well as who will receive assets belonging to the decedent and under what terms. If you die without a will, you are considered intestate. Under intestacy laws, the distribution of your assets is pre-determined according to degree of relationship. Not only can\\'t you choose your beneficiaries without a will, you can\\'t dictate the person you want to manage your affairs. You can\\'t plan to reduce or eliminate inheritance and/or estate taxes, or income taxes. Simply put: without a will, you typically have no control over your own assets at death.  It\\'s a lot to leave up to the law but a majority of Americans do just that - including celebrities. Here are 17 famous people who died without a will:  * Abraham Lincoln: one of the most famous lawyers of our time and the sixteenth president of the United States.  * Martin Luther King, Jr.: civil rights leader and activist.  * Jimi Hendrix: one of the greatest guitar players of all time.  * Pablo Picasso: famous artist.  * Howard Hughes: entrepreneur and billionaire  * Bob Marley: Jamaican singer/songwriter.  * Kurt Cobain: singer/songwriter and frontman for Nirvana.  * Tupac Shakur: rap artist and actor.  * Salvatore Phillip \"Sonny\" Bono: entertainer turned U.S. Congressman.  * Barry White: soulful entertainer.  * Stieg Larsson: famous author.  * James Brown: singer known as the Godfather of Soul. (Quick disclaimer: Brown did sign a will but it is subject to litigation.)  * Steve McNair: former NFL quarterback and Pro Bowler.  * Nate Dogg: rapper and actor.  * Amy Winehouse: British singer/songwriter.  * Prince: multi-talented artist.  * Michael Jackson: the King of Pop.

Inceptia\\'s counselors will connect with individual borrowers who have become delinquent on their student loans and address their specific repayment needs in order to find the best tailored solution to get them back on track with repaying their loans, thereby preventing student loan default. In turn, MiDEAL member colleges and universities who take advantage of this service will benefit by reducing their Cohort Default Rate (CDR).  The CDR, or the percentage of a school\\'s borrowers who enter repayment on their federal student loans during a fiscal year and default prior to the end of the next one to two fiscal years, remains a major concern for Michigan colleges and universities. The time and expense of conducting in-house default aversion programs is often not feasible for institutions. However, the threat of sanctions and the loss of federal funding, has created a need to keep the 3-year CDR well below the 30% threshold. Taking advantage of this MiDEAL opportunity will help address the CDR issues many Michigan institutions are facing. \"At no cost to the state, Michigan has taken a step toward helping colleges address this problem which is in the best interest of students,\" said Anne Wohlfert, State Bureau Administrator for the Michigan Department of Treasury.  Colleges and universities who take advantage of this ground breaking state initiative, will realize advantages that are not limited to actual dollar savings on this service. Indirect savings are also realized through the elimination of administrative duplication. The work of writing and updating specifications, drafting solicitations, maintaining a large, diverse pool of potential bidders, accepting, reviewing, and evaluating bid responses, making award recommendations, and negotiating terms and conditions has already been completed. Colleges and universities can have confidence that the RFP process has been completed by the State and representatives from the higher education community with best value and price considerations in mind. Inceptia will work individually with MiDEAL institutions to determine their unique needs and create a contractual arrangement accordingly.  In addition, Michigan high schools will have the opportunity to take advantage of Inceptia\\'s financial literacy modules at no cost through MiDEAL. This leads to students who are better prepared for the financial responsibilities of higher education.

       " 'Anzac Day 2016: WWI hero Simpson\\'s will discovered by WA State Records Office The last will and testament of renowned Gallipoli hero Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick is uncovered at Western Australia\\'s State Records Office.  It was a tragic but essential task: young WWI soldiers writing their wills in the field, assigning what little most had to their families and loved ones who were anxiously waiting at home for their return.  The will of a Gallipoli hero, Private John Simpson Kirkpatrick, was recently discovered by the State Records Office (SRO) in Western Australia and is now on display to mark Anzac Day.  Simpson and his donkey became symbols of the Anzac spirit, famed for transporting wounded Australian and New Zealand soldiers from the frontline at Gallipoli to safety in 1915.  According to the Australian War Memorial website, Simpson was born in England in 1892, joined the merchant marines at 17 and eventually made his way to Australia.  In August 1914, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force and started training at Blackboy Hill camp near Perth.  Simpson disembarked for training in Egypt and it was there, just weeks before his death, he pencilled a will on April 6, 1915.  \"In the event of my death, I give the whole of my property and effects to my mother Sarah Simpson,\" he wrote.  The probate file found with the will revealed his personal estate was worth 37 pounds and 13 shillings which is equivalent to about $4,500 today, according to the SRO.  State archivist Cathrin Cassarchis said the collection of wills depicted men who had not yet really embarked on their lives.  \"They are very often quite simple wills leaving very modest amounts to family members,\" she said.  \"Clearly, they were expecting the engagement at Gallipoli to be difficult because obviously a number of soldiers were handed sheets of paper on which to record their wills.  \"It\\'s a very personal part of our history ... the records such as wills not only tell individual stories but they paint a picture of what life was like for the young men on the front at this time.\"  Simpson was posted to the 3rd Field Ambulance and landed in Gallipoli on April 25.  As a stretcher bearer he decided he would enlist the help of a donkey to carry the wounded.  Only three weeks after landing he was killed by a Turkish bullet during a journey up Monash Valley to help wounded soldiers and became a national symbol of sacrifice and courage.  Culture and Arts Minister John Day said the will was a very poignant symbol of the enormous sacrifice and service that so many young soldiers from Australia and New Zealand gave.  \"This collection here really is fundamental to our heritage and our sense of identity as a state as part of the Commonwealth of Australia,\" he said.  Along with Simpson\\'s will, more than 3,600 wills from WA Great War military personnel have been uncovered and their names are .',\n",

So if you're planning to hit the shops this weekend, what should you be looking for?

There's no guarantee that they'll go on to be worth thousands, but there's also no doubt that rarity helps things increase in value if they become in demand items later on.  You can see the full list of special releases here .  Read more: 3million vinyl records sold in 2016 - the surprising people buying them  Careful here - lots of classic albums have been re-released, making it harder to tell if the record in your hand is 50 or 5 years old.  The right copy of Bowie's Space Oddity/Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud could be worth thousands, a re-release can be picked up for less than £10.  One of the key quick ways to check is to see if the record is recorded in mono or stereo. Most re-presses of older records were in stereo, so a mono copy is more likely to be original and so worth more.  Another quick way to check is to look up when the recording was first released and on which record label. Some records - for example Abbey Road - have later and far less valuable pressings later on, while the originals are collector's items.  You can read more on how to check if something an original pressing here .  Even a rare record is worth a lot less if you can't play it. Check for scratches. Most older vinyl records have surface scratches that probably don't matter much, but a deep scratch will seriously affect the record's value (and make it unplayable).  Also check the sleeve - looking for mould, splitting seams and ring wear. The better condition it's in, the more it's worth.

       " 'Which Fidelity Fund Is Better: Contrafund or New Millennium? It\\'s been a hard few years, but we think John Roth will be able to right the ship at New Millennium.  Two years ago, we pulled Fidelity Contrafund (symbol FCNTX) from the Kiplinger 25 and replaced it with Fidelity New Millennium (FMILX). We had no qualms about Contra\\'s performance or the estimable Will Danoff, the fund\\'s manager since 1990. Our concern was with its immense asset base, $114 billion at the time. We worried that Danoff would have trouble steering the battleship through increasingly turbulent markets. New Millennium, by contrast, had $3 billion in assets, about the same as it does today.  See Also: Fidelity New Millennium Hits a Rough Patch  The switch hasn\\'t paid dividends...yet. Over the past two years through February 29, New Millennium lost a cumulative 8.4%; Contra gained 4.6%, and Standard & Poor\\'s 500-stock index returned 7.2%.  New Millennium\\'s problem? Actually, there were three: too many energy stocks, too many small- and midsize-company stocks, and, in 2015 in particular, not enough FANGs--the acronym for Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Google, now called Alphabet. These four high-tech behemoths led the market last year.  Though Danoff and New Millennium\\'s manager, John Roth, both focus on growing companies, Roth has more of a value tilt: He\\'ll consider cheap stocks that are out of favor or economically sensitive companies that are rebounding. So Roth started to boost his energy holdings after the sector began to tumble, along with oil prices, in mid 2014. At last report, the fund had 14% of its assets in energy stocks, about twice the weight in the S&P 500. Although the energy sector seemed to turn the corner in mid January, whether the turnaround will lead to a meaningful improvement in New Millennium\\'s near-term results remains to be seen.  Investors\\' infatuation with large-company stocks also hurt the fund. Roth is free to invest in companies of any size--and he does. Some 40% of New Millennium\\'s assets sit in small-cap and mid-cap stocks. That has been a drag on the fund\\'s performance because, on the whole, the smaller the company, the worse the stock performance over the past two years.  Roth\\'s long-term record is solid. Since he became manager in July 2006, New Millennium has returned 7.0% annualized, edging the S&P 500 by an average of 0.4 percentage point per year. Morningstar analyst Katie Rushkewicz Reichart says that investors shouldn\\'t count out New Millennium, despite the recent \"rough patch.\" Roth\\'s experience, plus the likelihood that the market will eventually turn against the higher fliers (if it hasn\\'t already) and turn toward the unloved, should eventually benefit New Millennium\\'s shareholders.

       " 'IMPACT OF NEW PENSION FREEDOMS TO BE REVIEWED BY CITY REGULATOR A review into how well the new pension freedoms are working for consumers will be launched by the City regulator in the coming months.  The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) plans to launch the retirement outcomes review at some point in the next six months.  The FCA also said it needs to consider any potential mis-selling risks that could arise from people being able to sell their retirement annuities for a lump sum from next year.  Launched a year ago on Wednesday, the freedoms allow people aged 55 and over to take their pension pot how they wish, subject to tax. They are no longer required to use the pot to buy a retirement annuity.  In its plan for 2016/17, the FCA said the review will consider the impact of the pension reforms on competition and switching in the market.  It said that with some people now releasing their pension pots as cash, these changes in behaviour \"present different risks to the risks of selecting an annuity\".  The plan said: \"We will conduct work to help us understand how consumers react to \\'wake-up packs\\', which encourage them to take action, and how they use and respond to the various annuity comparison tools.  \"We will undertake work to ensure that consumers are able to make choices that are in their best interests given their circumstances.\"  From April 2017, people who already have an annuity will be able to sell it on in exchange for a lump sum.  The FCA\\'s report said: \"There are several risks we need to consider, for example, the risks of mis-selling and poor value for money for consumers, particularly those with small pension pots and the risk that our interventions undermine competition or stifle market development.\"  Recent research from Citizens Advice found that nearly nine in 10 people would fail to spot common warning signs of a pensions scam - such as the promise of unusually high investment returns and offers of \"free financial advice\".  The FCA said pensions are a priority for it for the coming financial year, given the fundamental recent changes to the market.  Its report said: \"In some areas, such as pensions, Government policies are increasingly shifting responsibility for financial planning to individual consumers, which brings with it both opportunities and risks, such as the adequacy of consumers\\' long-term financial planning.\"  The regulator will also target resources to raise consumer awareness, disrupt scams and take enforcement action against unauthorised businesses.  The FCA also plans to consult on a planned cap on early pension exit charges. Parliament has given the FCA a duty to impose a cap on the charges amid fears that high charges could create a barrier for some people trying to access their pension savings.  It said: \"We will be consulting on this to ensure that consumers are able to use their pension freedoms and transfer their pensions more freely without unnecessary barriers.\"  ends',\n",

If you're self-employed, you can set up a pension with a provider like Nutmeg, Hargreaves Lansdown or Fidelity  The downside is you can't get any money out until you're over 55.

       " 'Budget 2016: Reporting Of \"Grandfathered\" New Home Sales Grandfathered SalesHistorically, builders have found themselves in situations where they enter into agreements of purchase and sale in respect of new homes and, subsequent to entering into the agreements, but prior to the close of the transactions, the government announces that the relevant provincial sales tax will be harmonized with the GST or that there will be an increase in the HST rate. Where such proposed HST changes are implemented prior to the close of the new home sales, the sales are generally relieved from either the provincial component of the HST, or the HST rate increase, as applicable (\"\").  RebateCurrently, builders are required to report certain information relating to Grandfathered Sales on their electronic GST/HST returns in cases where the purchaser was not entitled to a GST New Housing Rebate or a GST New Residential Rental Property Rebate (the \"\"). Failure to report this information on a return could result in the imposition of penalties against the builder.  Budget DayElectionTo simplify the reporting obligations of builders, Budget 2016 proposes to limit the information reporting requirements of builders to Grandfathered Sales with a purchase price of $450,000 or more (i.e., those sales with a purchase price that exceeds the threshold for receiving a Rebate). This measure will apply in respect of any reporting period that ends after March 22, 2016 (the \"\"). In addition, builders will also be permitted, for a limited period of time, to correct certain past reporting errors, by making an election (the \"\") that will apply to Grandfathered Sales that occurred before Budget Day and, in limited circumstances, after Budget Day. By making the Election, Budget 2016 gives builders the opportunity to correct past reporting errors relating to Grandfathered Sales of $450,000 or more without the imposition of penalties.  To correct past reporting errors, builders will generally have to make the Election and report the required information on a current GST/HST return for a reporting period ending on or after May 1, 2016 and before 2017. The required Election is to be completed on the prescribed form and filed with the Canada Revenue Agency on or after May 1, 2016, but no later than the due date for filing the GST/HST return for the particular reporting period. The Election will apply to Grandfathered Sales in respect of which the federal component of HST became payable on or after July 1, 2010, but before the end of the particular reporting period.

       " 'Boost in overseas student loan repayments MIL OSI - Source: New Zealand Government - Press Release/Statement  Headline: Boost in overseas student loan repayments  Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment Minister Steven Joyce and Revenue Minister Michael Woodhouse have welcomed a further boost in repayments from overseas-based student loan borrowers.  Over the first two months of this year there was a 31 per cent increase in repayments by overseas based borrowers over the same period in 2015. In January and February this year $29.7 million was received from overseas-based borrowers, compared with $22.7 million in January and February last year.  There was increased communication from overseas-based borrowers as well. Emails to Inland Revenue were up 62 per cent over January and February and phone calls increased 55 per cent.  \"There was definitely a much higher level of activity at the start of this year, with Inland Revenue receiving over 20,000 additional repayments compared with last year,\" Mr Joyce says. \"February was also a record month for lump sum payments that cleared loans in full. More than $2.2 million was paid, clearing 103 loans outright.\"  \"Inland Revenue believe that the publicity around the first arrest at the border has contributed to the increased activity. It\\'s likely that a number of people were spurred into action. It\\'s just a pity that it takes these sort of steps to encourage some people to meet their obligations to taxpayers so we can continue to support future generations of students.\"  \"Around 20 people are currently being actively monitored by Inland Revenue for possible arrest when they return to New Zealand. Of the 112,390 overseas-based borrowers, 70 per cent are currently in default. Anyone with outstanding debt should contact Inland Revenue to organise a repayment plan, or if they\\'re unable to make repayments they can apply for a hardship grant.\"  In the financial year to June 30th 2015, the net amount repaid by overseas borrowers totalled $184.7 million. Already this financial year repayments by overseas based borrowers have reached $133.8 million at the end of February.  The Government has been running an overseas-based borrower compliance initiative since late 2010. The programme uses a range of tools to target borrowers in default, and is on track to reach its current target of lifting payments by overseas-based borrowers by $100 million a year.  \"From July this year we will have an information sharing agreement with the Australian Tax Office which will allow information on student loan borrowers living in Australia to be shared with Inland Revenue. The majority of overseas-based borrowers live in Australia and this new agreement will be a significant step forward in speeding up the repayment of the estimated $3.25 billion borrowed by those living offshore,\" Mr Woodhouse says.  \"Inland Revenue will continue to target overseas-based borrowers who are in default and will use a range of methods to recover the money owed to New Zealand tax payers, including legal action when appropriate.\"  -',\n",

Morneau points to a series of framed pictures featuring etchings of $1 coins. The artist, he explains, flipped each of the loonies repeatedly to identify which might be considered the luckiest of the bunch. That coin, now encased, also hangs from the wall.  \"So, that\\'s the lucky loonie,\" Morneau said. \"We thought that was an appropriate piece of art for the Finance Department.\" Just days after tabling his maiden budget, good fortune seemed to be on the former Toronto businessman\\'s mind as he explained what his private-sector expertise brings to one of his next big tasks: enhancing the Canada Pension Plan.  One\\'s ability to retire in dignity is often driven \"partially by luck,\" said Morneau, who has advised Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne on pensions.  There\\'s a role for government when someone in a private, defined-contribution plan - and who hasn\\'t saved enough - happens to retire at a time when the stock market\\'s down, he continued.  The Liberals repeated their support for strengthening the CPP in last week\\'s budget, which noted the dangers of things like failing privatesector pension plans and the risk that healthier Canadians could outlive their savings.  Until last fall, Morneau was executive chairman of the human resources firm Morneau Shepell, a company that describes itself as Canada\\'s largest provider of pension-administration technology and services.  Morneau said he hopes to eventually get some consensus on enhancing the CPP, a goal outlined in the government\\'s election platform. Doing so would require the support of seven of the 10 provinces representing two-thirds of the country\\'s population.  The provinces and territories are scheduled to reconvene in June to continue talks that began in December on the polarizing subject of CPP reform. The aim is to reach a collective decision by the end of the year. But it\\'s still unclear how much support the Liberals will garner, even though the provinces agreed in December to continue discussing the subject. Wynne, for one, supports CPP expansion and plans to proceed with mandatory payroll deductions starting in 2018, for the new Ontario Retirement Pension Plan. That plan essentially mirrors the CPP for anyone who doesn\\'t already have a workplace pension.  Other big provinces like Quebec and British Columbia remain unconvinced. Quebec already has a public pension plan and B.C. has expressed concerns about the country\\'s fragile economy. Saskatchewan is opposed.

       " 'Court Approves Settlement in Fifth Third Stock Drop Suit The case reached the Supreme Court, and set new standards of pleading for lawsuits against retirement plans that hold on to company stock.  A federal district court has preliminarily approved a settlement in the case of Dudenhoeffer v. Fifth Third Bancorp.\\xa0  The settlement agreement calls for $6 million to be placed into an account to be distributed to all class members in the case, minus certain fees.\\xa0  In addition, the agreement calls for Fifth Third to make design changes to its retirement plan, including freezing the Fifth Third Stock Fund, so that no new money will be put into the fund. However, plan participants are allowed to transfer out of the fund if they wish. The recordkeeper of the plan will send an annual notice to participants that have more than 20% of their account invested in Fifth Third Stock Fund and educate them about the benefits of asset allocation and diversification.\\xa0  According to the settlement agreement, Fifth Third currently funds plan contributions in the form of cash (not shares) and agrees not to change this for at least the next eight years. The Fifth Third Bancorp Pension, Profit Sharing, and Medical Plan Committee members will receive annual fiduciary training, and Fifth Third agrees to increase this training to be conducted at least twice annually.\\xa0  NEXT: Long case history, ultimately achieving fame  The case was filed in 2008 when John Dudenhoefer, a Fifth Third employee, charged that the bank hid its true financial picture leading to its stock price to be artificially inflated. Then the stock suffered a major plunge in its share price when the company\\'s financial problems were revealed. The suit alleges the bank\\'s action caused the plan to lose millions of dollars.  In 2010, a federal judge in Ohio turned aside arguments that Fifth Third Bancorp committed a fiduciary breach when it continued to include company stock in its profit-sharing plan. Senior U.S. District Judge Sandra S. Beckwith of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio based her decision on the presumption of prudence established in a 1995 decision in Moench v. Robertson.  However, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision, saying that the \"legislative history combined with a natural and clear reading of Section 404 [of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)] [led] to the inexorable conclusion that ESOP fiduciaries are subject to the same fiduciary standards as any other fiduciary except to the extent that the standards require diversification of investments.\"\\xa0  The U.S. Supreme Courtagreed to rule on the presumption of prudence issue, and in June 2014, decided fiduciaries of employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) are not entitled to any special presumption of prudence under ERISA.

       " 'House backs down on bill to opt out of water supply rules PHOENIX (AP) - The House debated, but ultimately chose to delay a proposal Thursday that could clear the way for a Sierra Vista developer to build a new subdivision, regardless of it having an adequate water supply.  The legislation would help developer Castle & Cooke get around a lawsuit that\\'s holding up the development of nearly 7,000 homes in Sierra Vista, but opponents on both sides of the aisle say it could also unravel Arizona\\'s carefully crafted water policy.  The stiff resistance led Republican Rep. Brenda Barton of Payson, who carried the bill for sponsor Sen. Gail Griffin, R-Hereford, to withhold the measure before a vote could take place. The legislation could still come back however.  The bill would allow some cities in Cochise and Yuma counties to opt out of rules that require them to have at least a 100-years\\' worth of water.  Republicans were divided on the issue during debate.  Reps. Rusty Bowers of Mesa and Noel Campbell of Prescott expressed unease with the measure they say could set a precedent endangering future water supplies.  \"I think it\\'s bad policy to allow cities to opt out of county ordinances with an adequate supply of water,\" Campbell said.  Campbell was referencing a 2007 law that allows county supervisors in rural areas outside of active water management areas to adopt rules requiring new subdivisions to have a 100-year water supply. Cochise and Yuma counties, and the towns of Clarkdale and Patagonia have adopted the rules.  But Rep. Karen Fann, R-Prescott, defended Griffin\\'s measure, which she and other Republican supporters say is a jurisdictional issue.  \"If we allow counties, cities and towns to start enacting their own water laws over and above state regulations there could be some serious unintended consequences,\" Fann said.  The lawsuit is the result of the U.S. Bureau of Land management suing the Arizona Department of Water Resources for issuing a 100-year water supply guarantee to the Castle & Cooke using water resources that the Bureau of Land Management claims is part of a federally protected conservation area along the San Pedro River.  Maricopa County Superior Court ruled against the Arizona Department of Water Resources, but it has since appealed leaving the water rights issue hanging.  While the developer may still be able to build if the law passes, water for future residents will depend on the result of the lawsuit, said Kathleen Ferris, a senior fellow for Morrison institute\\'s Kyle Center for water policy.  \"It is in everybody\\'s best interest to find connection to surface and ground water, rather than let people move in and find their ground water supplies are cut off,\" she said.  A second bill, Senate Bill 1400, would let water adequacy ordinances expire after two years and require a unanimous vote by the board of county supervisors to renew the ordinance for another five years.',\n",
       " 'News NDP outline $40M plan to help students What\\'s better than a student loan? One you never have to pay off. The Manitoba NDP are attempting to win high marks with student voters with a campaign pledge to convert student loans to grants.  The NDP stressed their campaign pledge isn\\'t a mere copy of a previous Manitoba Liberal one, however, because it sets fewer limits on who can get a grant. If elected, the NDP also plans to spend four times as much on its overall post-secondary supports than its Liberal competition.  \"We want to remove barriers to post-secondary education,\" said NDP leader Greg Selinger. \"We\\'re going to take student loans and convert them to grants right upfront. So that will make a huge difference for young people.\" The NDP promise to devote $40 million per year to reduce the cost of post-secondary education, which also includes doubling the Manitoba Scholarship and Bursary Initiative from $4.5 million to $9 million and extending free tuition to students who\\'ve been in the care of Child and Family Services up to age 25. The latter benefi t currently ends at age 21.  Back in the fall, the Manitoba Liberals promised $10 million per year to convert the provincial student loans into non-repayable grants. But those who fail courses or drop out of school would have to repay their loans and the benefit was limited to loans started in 2016/17.  Student per formance wouldn\\'t be considered in the NDP pledge and existing loans would be eligible, Selinger said.  Michael Barkman, Manitoba chair of the Canadian Federation of Students, believes the NDP\\'s \"upfront\" benefit would entice students to study and work in Manitoba.  \"Investments in education (are) so critical to our economy. Over 70 to 80% of jobs require some sort of post-secondary education,\" said Barkman.  Barkman estimates the average student debt is around $19,000.  In an email, Liberal leader Rana Bokhari accused the NDP of flip-flopping to copy her previous campaign pledge.  \"It\\'s nice to see the premier coming around on an idea he was so critical of when we presented it last November, and until last week lied to the public saying it was too expensive,\" wrote Bokhari.  A taxpayers\\' watchdog, however, believes both plans are flawed because they haven\\'t yet been paired with equivalent cuts to other government spending.  And with the province\\'s summary deficit expected to hit $773 million this year, pricey election promises just aren\\'t realistic, said Todd MacKay, prairie director of the Canadian Taxpayers Federation.  \"Right now, we\\'re borrowing money. If you increase spending dramatically, ultimately, those students will pay that bill,\" said MacKay. \"They can pay it now or later through taxes with interest on top of it.\"  jpursaga@postmedia.com Twitter: @pursagawpgsun  Brian Donogh, Winnipeg Sun / NDP leader Greg Selinger announces a plan to make post secondary education more affordable during a press conference Monday.;',\n",
       " 'YourMoney Find a circuit-breaker from shock of power bills SOARING energy bills have prompted utility companies to roll out a range of payment options and innovative plans to help ease the burden on household budgets.  Consumers were slugged with increases of up to 61 per cent between 2008 and 2014 on their energy costs, according to Australian Bureau of Statistics data, despite a 7 per cent fall in household consumption.  So providers are devising ways to reduce the shock of big bills, such as locked-in energy contracts resembling fixed-rate home loan deals.  Energy giant Origin rolled out the concept to existing customers earlier this month, allowing an agreed amount to be set between the retailer and consumer - so that the customer pays the same amount each fortnight or month regardless of how much energy they use.  We\\'ve asked the experts what are some of the key options available to customers to help cope with utility bill pain.  BILL SMOOTHING This type of payment helps reduce the impact when bill time comes, by following a forecast of how much energy you will use, says financial comparison website comparethemarket. com.au\\'s Abigail Koch.  \"It involves spreading the estimated total cost of your energy bills for the next year across equal instalments,\" she says.  \"This means you\\'ll avoid bill shock altogether as you pay the same amount each month.\" Usually the retailer will keep an eye on your usage and they\\'ll make adjustments to your payments if needed, which includes whether you\\'ve paid not enough or too much.  PAY ON TIME OR DIRECT DEBIT This can be one of the easiest ways to save, with many retailers including online operator Click Energy offering customers discounts for electronic on-time payments.  Some retailers also give a small percentage off if you hand over your direct debit details to ensure payment is made promptly.  Origin spokesman Stuart Osbourne says the regular timing of direct debit payments allows consumers to know exactly when they will have to pay their bills.  \"People can use direct debit to align (payments) with their pay cycle. The fortnightly option of this is quite popular,\" he says.  Koch suggests opting for a more frequent billing cycle to help you keep on top of your bills. \"If you\\'re struggling to cope with massive quarterly bills, then you should ask your energy retailer if you can pay on a monthly or fortnightly basis instead,\" she says.  PAYMENT EXTENSIONS Some retailers offer customers automated payment extensions - often of about two weeks from the bill\\'s due date.  By phoning the retailer and asking for more time, you can sometimes be given the green light for an extension at no charge.  PAPER BILLS The rising costs of printing and posting bills by snail mail has prompted retailers to encourage consumers to receive bills electronically.Osbourne says many customers have instead turned to e-billing, which allows them to receive bills in their email inboxes and avoid the charges.',\n",
       " 'Retail & Leisure BHS on knife edge ahead of crucial vote Landlords hold key to ailing chain\\'s future after pensions lifeboat decides not to take part in ballot of creditors  BHS\\'S biggest creditor plans to abstain from a crucial restructuring vote this week, leaving the struggling department store chain\\'s future on a knife edge.  It is understood the state-backed Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which is rescuing BHS\\'s 20,000 savers, intends to hold back from voting on a controversial insolvency proposal on Wednesday. BHS is trying to push through a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) that would cut the rents on more than half its 164 stores and give it the option to close 40 after a period.  BHS needs the approval of 75% of its creditors to proceed with the plan. Without a deal, it has warned it is \"very likely\" to go into administration, putting 11,000 jobs at risk.  The PPF, which is backed by the government and funded by a levy on the retirement schemes of blue-chip companies, such as BP, is in the process of absorbing BHS\\'s two pension funds. They have a combined deficit of £571m on a \"buyout\" basis, which is the cost of transferring them to an insurer. That makes the pensions lifeboat BHS\\'s largest creditor by far.  A source close to the situation said there was a \"reasonable prospect\" the PPF would abstain from the vote \"and let the landlords, who it actually affects, say yes or no\".  The move would put BHS\\'s future in the hands of its landlords, lenders and suppliers. KPMG, the accountancy firm handling the process, counts only \"yes\" or \"no\" votes, meaning the department store chain needs the support of three-quarters of those who turn out.  Landlords are torn on the CVA plan. One said an administration would be \"less palatable than a stay of execution, which may well be what this turns out to be\".  Controversy has grown since Sir Philip Green\\'s Arcadia sold BHS for £1 to a little-known consortium called Retail Acquisitions last year. The transaction passed the company\\'s huge pension deficit to owners with no retail experience. Dominic Chappell, Retail Acquisitions\\'s leader, is a former racing driver and two-time bankrupt.  About 13,000 current and former BHS staff below retirement age face cuts of at least 10% to their benefits as a result of the PPF bailout.  The Pensions Regulator is now pursuing Green for a contribution to the company\\'s gaping pension deficit.  The Monaco-based tycoon, who paid more than £400m of dividends from BHS to his family during his 15-year ownership, has so far offered £80m to plug the gap. His offer comprises £40m in cash and £40m in the form of a charge held by Arcadia over BHS\\'s assets.  It is understood that Green could be asked to pay more than three times that sum. Talks with the regulator and the PPF are continuing.',\n",

He said there is a \"strong public interest\" in obtaining information about the fund, which covers about 12,000 current and former workers, \"because any funding shortfall could lead to pressure to increase the public funding of the plan,\" even if there is no contractual obligation to do so.  A Massachusetts Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that the records of the MBTA pension fund should be public because the system receives tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding from the transit authority.  A Massachusetts Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday that the records of the MBTA pension fund should be public because the system receives tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer funding from the transit authority.  The decision, by Judge Kenneth W. Salinger in Suffolk Superior Court, concluded that \"the Board does indeed receive public funds from the MBTA, and thus that the Board\\'s records are now subject to mandatory disclosure under the public records law.\"  From 2009 to 2013, the MBTA contributed $252.9 million to the retirement fund.  The ruling could end decades of secrecy by the $1.6 billion retirement system for transportation workers, which has shielded its records because it says it is a private trust.

Carl Valvo, the lawyer for the T pension fund, was not available for comment. An MBTA pension fund spokesman declined to comment on the decision.  The judge is planning to hold a status conference, at which the T could raise additional \"constitutional\" claims. The pension fund also could appeal the decision.  The ruling comes more than two years after the Globe unsuccessfully sought records in December 2013 related to a $25 million hedge fund loss that the pension fund failed to disclose.

The move follows a decision by the community issues committee on Feb. 16.  In an interview with the Canadian Gazette on Feb. 19, the foundation\\'s acting manager of fundraising, Rosemary Jones said the reasoning behind the one-page insert is twofold: increase donations and visibility.  \"A key part of our strategic plan over the next number of years is to absolutely grow our donor base,\" Jones continued, \"and to ensure the foundation is in front of the hospital\\'s catchment area.\"  Often this is accomplished by way of direct and bulk mailings.  \"However, for direct mailing you need those addresses,\" Jones said.  \"Often what people get from charities is bulk mail, which is very expensive,\" she added.  The acting manager of fundraising, thinking about how she could \"get information about the foundation into the mailboxes of people we don\\'t already know about,\" the town came to mind.  Jones sent an initial email to chief administrative officer (CAO) Paul Knowles, introducing herself and giving him the rationale behind her thinking.  \"It\\'s not all about chasing dollars,\" she said. \"It\\'s as much about profile and recognition, as well as (promoting) the good work done by the Carleton Place & District Memorial Hospital.\"  Jones was very clear with Knowles.  \"I told him I recognized there are a number of very worthy charities that would want to take part in a process like this,\" she said.  \"However, the hospital affects and impacts everyone in our community,\" Jones continued, \"and I felt this gave us an advantage...a reason for us to be considered.\"  Monies raised by way of the foundation will go towards the purchase of vital patient care equipment the hospital requires to maintain and enhance the excellent standards of care they currently provide to the community.  After a follow-up email to Knowles, Jones learned the matter would be coming before council, and she is completely thrilled with the community issues committee\\'s decision.  \"It was great news!\" Jones told this newspaper, \"and the next day (treasurer) Phil Hogan call me to tell me what he requires.\"  March 11 is the foundation\\'s deadline to provide material for its one-page insert.  Approximately 4,600 water bills are mailed out in Carleton Place, with many going to landlords and businesses. A number of residents have wells and don\\'t receive a water bill.  \"This is a wonderful relationship builder between the foundation and the town,\" Jones pointed out, \"and we appreciate everything the town does for the foundation.\"  The community issues committee also voted to create a set policy for dealing with these types of requests in the future.  \"I find it extraordinary how generous Carleton Place truly is: people and municipality,\" Jones said.

       " 'New LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute Study Reveals Majority of Workers Save Only Enough to Equal Employer Match Feb. 24 -- New research from LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute reveals that workers from for-profit and not-for-profit organizations will save only enough in their defined contribution (DC) plan to receive the full company match.  \"The study demonstrates the powerful incentive a company match can have on employee behavior,\" said Michael Ericson, LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute analyst. \"Institute research shows nearly half of American workers believe they are not saving enough for retirement and 4 in 10 working households have less than $25,000 saved for retirement. Plan providers can help employers increase their employee\\'s savings behavior by recommending a stretch match strategy, which would require an employee to save a higher percentage to attain the full company match.\" (chart): (http://www.limra.com/uploadedImages/limra.com/LIMRA_Root/Posts/PR/_Media/Images/2016-02-Stretch-Match.jpg?)  The study, which compared workers from not-for-profit and for-profit companies, found only 4 in 10 workers (both NFP and FP) consider themselves \"savers.\" And of those who have access to a DC plan, 20 percent were not contributing to their employer\\'s DC plan at all. For profit workers who don\\'t contribute to their workplace defined contribution plan were more likely to say they cannot afford to do so or they have competing saving priorities, compared with not-for-profit workers (67 percent vs. 53 percent).  Institute researchers found more than a third of Millennial workers in both the not-for-profit and for-profit sectors are saving 10 percent or more (34 percent and 35 percent respectively). Only 27 percent of Boomers and 28 percent of Gen X not-for-profit workers are saving at that rate. In the for-profit sector, Boomers and Gen X workers save a bit more than their Millennial counterparts-36 percent of Boomers and 35 percent of Gen X workers are saving 10 percent or more in their retirement plans.  Even with robust saving habits, pre-retirees surveyed have no plan on how they will withdraw the assets from their DC plans once they retire-just one third have calculated their savings and expenses in retirement. The study found nearly half of pre-retirees said they plan to withdraw 9 percent or more of their assets each year in retirement. Most financial experts recommend drawing no more than 4 percent a year and in low-interest rate environments, maybe less.  \"With longevity at an all-time high, retirement can last more than three decades,\" said Ericson. \"Understanding how to safely draw down savings becomes critically important for retirees. Not-for-profit workers are more likely to have a pension income along with their DC plan, but most for-profit workers will not have one.\"  Ericson said professional advice can be helpful to both types of workers. The key is to understand the unique challenges and obstacles each group is facing.  Source: Limra',\n",
       " 'Economy Canadians without company pension plan face uphill battle to stay out of poverty, study finds Many aging Canadians do not have nearly enough saved up for retirement, a new study from the Broadbent Institute suggests.  Canadians without an employee pension represent 47 per cent of those aged 55-64 in the country. A mere 15-20 per cent in this group are middle-class with enough savings to comfortably retire in 10 years. The study says anyone outside this bracket will have a hard time building up their assets to avoid poverty, even with a decade to save.  The study, penned by Richard Shillington, focuses on the levels of income provided by Old Age Security and Guaranteed Income Supplement relative to personal savings. The finding is that these benefits are not adequate to keep the retired from falling into poverty.

The senior poverty gap stands at $2.5 billion annually. The study warns of levels getting worse if the issue of retirement savings isn\\'t addressed.  \"This new data on retirement savings and gaps in support makes one thing perfectly clear - we have a retirement income crisis on our hands that requires urgent government action now,\" said Rick Smith, Executive Director of the Broadbent Institute.  The value of retirement assets for those without employee pension are shockingly low. Canadians making $20,000-$50,000 have an average of $250 saved for their golden years. Half of the demographic has less than half a year\\'s income saved. The average single senior falls $5,600 below the poverty line, with a median income of under $20,000.  The study says Ottawa\\'s proposed 10 per cent GIS increase could have the minor impact of alleviating senior poverty by 12 per cent. This would still leave some 634,000 retirees impoverished.  \"Our new study shows now isn\\'t the time for Ottawa and the provinces to punt on expanding CPP,\" said Smith. \"In fact, we need federal leadership to make this happen. Boosting the GIS by 10 per cent for single seniors is a start but not nearly enough.\"',\n",
       " 'Hundreds rally against student debt, call for elimination of tuition fees About 350 people with rallying cries like \"Christy Clark, you\\'re a loan shark\" took part in a protest against student debt at the legislature Wednesday.  The protesters walked down Government Street from Centennial Square to get to the legislature grounds, where Brontë Renwick-Shields recounted how she had accumulated $30,000 in debt during her time so far at the University of Victoria.  The fourth-year political science major, who chairs the UVic Students\\' Society, said her debt has grown even though she is working full time for the students\\' society and takes on up to three jobs during the summer break.  \"I\\'ve still got another year of education to go, so by the time I finish I imagine I\\'ll be around $35,000 in debt, which is the average in B.C.,\" she said.  Renwick-Shields said she estimates her student-loan payments will be about $700 a month when she graduates - higher than her rent of $575 a month. On top of that, she said, graduates have to contend with a youth unemployment rate of 13 per cent (which includes those up to age 24) and an \"underemployment\" rate - not finding work in line with their education - of 27 per cent.  \"Students are graduating with debt and they\\'re not able to get into jobs where they can pay that debt back,\" Renwick-Shields said.  She said things look to be even tougher in the future.  \"Our generation is the most indebted in history,\" she said. \"And as bad as it is for us, when our little brothers and sisters head into the post-secondary system, it will be much worse.\"  Renwick-Shields said the province should bring in an immediate tuition fee freeze, increase core funding for education and gradually eliminate tuition fees over the next 10 years. She said tuition is free in more than 30 countries around the world.  Advanced Education Minister Andrew Wilkinson countered in a statement that post-secondary education in B.C. is affordable \"for students, families and taxpayers.\"  Wilkinson said that about 70 per cent of eligible students in the public post-secondary system do not make use of loans from the B.C. government. \"According to a 2014 survey by B.C. Stats, graduates who accessed interest-free government student loans throughout their studies had a median debt of $20,000.\"  Wilkinson said Statistics Canada figures put the average annual undergraduate tuition in B.C. as the fourth lowest in the country at $5,305. He said that has increased 12 per cent since 2004-05, and annual tuition increases have been capped at two per cent since 2005.

The dollar value of all those luxury sales crossed $500 million in 2015.  \"Tight market conditions prevailed throughout much of the year, with fewer ultra high-end listings coming to market overall, particularly in prestigious enclaves south of the 401,\" said the Re/Max broker, referring to the major highway that cuts east-west across the city. \"Pent-up demand is expected to carry over into 2016, with affluent purchasers waiting patiently in the wings for the right product.\"  Related  \\'It\\'s the new Waterloo\\': How the rise of Silicon Valley North is fuelling another Canadian condo boom( http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/its-the-new-waterloo-how-the-rise-of-silicon-valley-north-is-fuelling-another-canadian-condo-boom )  How to use your RRSP to invest in real estate( http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/managing-wealth/how-to-use-your-rrsp-to-invest-in-real-estate )  Vancouver ranks third most unaffordable housing market in study, worse than New York and London( http://business.financialpost.com/personal-finance/mortgages-real-estate/vancouver-ranked-third-most-unaffordable-housing-market-in-world-worse-than-new-york-and-london )  Most of the sales over $5 million were in the 416 area code, with Bridle Path and Sunnybrook area reporting 43 per cent of the high-end sales. Sixteen per cent of sales came from Forest Hill South.  Listings were scarce in other upscale neighbourhoods closer to the city\\'s core such as Rosedale, Moore Park, Forest Hill, Annex, and South Hill.  Cohen said the luxury end of the market usually softens first in volatile economic times but gyrations in the stock market might be sending a message to the ultra wealthy to look at real estate again. The strong U.S. dollar and weak loonie is expected to bolster demand as international buyers take advantage of the exchange rate.  \"While purchasers, for the most part, were local entrepreneurs, business executives, and professionals, foreign investors also factored into the mix in 2015,\" said Cohen. \"Buyers from Mainland China, in particular, should play an even greater role in the top end of the GTA\\'s luxury market in the next six to 12 months, based on the upward trajectory of the US dollar.\"  gmarr@nationalpost.com( mailto:gmarr@nationalpost.com )  twitter.com/dustywallet( http://twitter.com/dustywallet )',\n",

       " 'Money Housing \\'severely unaffordable\\' as Sydney price to income ratio worsens Sydney second least affordable after Hong Kong in survey of housing in major metropolitan markets across the world  Housing in Australia has been categorised as \"severely unaffordable\" compared with metropolitan markets around the world, a comprehensive survey has found.  Of 10 major metropolitan markets assessed in the housing affordability survey, Hong Kong had the least affordable housing for the sixth year in a row, followed by Sydney.  Sydney replaced Vancouver as the second least affordable major market thanks to a surge in its housing price to income ratio, the largest increase by any market in the 12-year history of the survey, which is undertaken each year by the urban planning research agency Demographia.  Related: How Australian households became the most indebted in the world  Vancouver was third, while there was a three-way tie for the fourth least affordable middle-income housing between Auckland, Melbourne and San Jose.  \"Auckland\\'s loss in housing affordability, like that of Sydney, was huge,\" said the report, which was published on Monday.  \"Each of the severely unaffordable major markets was characterised by more restrictive land use regulation, almost all with urban containment boundaries or variations.\"  In Sydney the median household income was $84,600 compared with a median house price of $1,032,000, while, in Melbourne, the median income was $75,600 compared with a median house price of $730,000. The Perth, Adelaide and Brisbane property markets were also in the top 20 least affordable.  In his introduction to the report, the businessman and Family First senator Bob Day wrote that, for more than 100 years, the average Australian family had been able to buy its first home on one wage.  \"The median house price was around three times the median income, allowing young home buyers easy entry into the housing market,\" he wrote.  \"The median house price has increased, in real terms, by more than 300%. The economic consequences of this change have been devastating. New home owners pay a much higher percentage of their income on house payments than they should. Similarly, renters are paying increased rental costs reflective of the higher capital and financing costs in turn paid by landlords.\"  Related: Melbourne house rents hit record high as agents report high demand  Housing affordability had deteriorated across Australia, New Zealand and the UK \"virtually without regard to market size or demand\", he wrote.  Of the 367 markets assessed, there were 89 affordable markets; 75 in the US, nine in Canada, three in Ireland and two in Australia, both in Western Australia.  The most affordable Australian markets were in Karratha, where the median household income is $174,800 and the median house price is $440,000, and in Kalgoorlie, where the median income is $120,000 compared with a house price of $350,000.  The survey follows the release of a report from the Tenants Union of Victoria on Sunday that found 35% of Melbourne\\'s suburbs are now unaffordable.',\n",
       " 'Court rules against Norton in \\'complex\\' pension case The U.S. District for the Western District of Kentucky ruled against Louisville-based Norton Healthcare Inc.\\'s pension plan in a complex legal battle that involves how payments to a class of early retirees were calculated.  But really, \"to conclude that this matter is complex is probably an understatement,\" U.S. District Judge Thomas Russell said in the Jan. 6 ruling.  The case involves an Employee Retirement Income Security Act pension dispute between the Louisville-based health system\\'s pension plan and a class of early retirees.  There are a few issues in this case, originally filed in 2008, but a big one surrounds the formula for calculating the pensioners\\' retirement income. The pensioners think they were underpaid.  The retirees elected to receive their payments in lump-sum installments, but they argued that the way Norton calculated those installments didn\\'t adjust for increases in the cost of living. They also said Norton didn\\'t include the value of early retirement subsidies in its calculation and didn\\'t use the formula it should have under the early retirement plan.  On Oct. 31, 2013, the court granted, in part, the retirees\\' request for summary judgment. Their retirement payments would be recalculated to include cost-of-living adjustments, but not the subsidies for early retirement, Bloomberg Law reports.  Norton was ordered to come up with a new formula that would make the lump-sum payments \"at least actuarially equivalent\" to the pensioners\\' monthly retirement income, with increases to adjust for cost of living.  \"The court originally thought agreeing on a formula would not be a time-consuming process,\" the Jan. 6 opinion said. \"Obviously, it was time-consuming.\"  Norton presented a formula, but Russell ruled that it didn\\'t meet the \"actuarially equivalent\" condition and that the pensioners\\' formula will be used instead. (Both Norton\\'s and the pensioners\\' formulas are included in the court\\'s opinion.)  Norton disagrees with the ruling and is looking at options for an appeal, according to a statement emailed by vice president of public relations and chief communications officer Tom Johnson.  \"With all due respect to Judge Russell, we disagree with his ruling in this matter,\" the statement said. \"The court has acknowledged the inherent complexity of this case and the significant amount of time required to work through the details.\"  Norton\\'s statement also cited Russell\\'s own opinion, pointing to a line where the judge suggested \"another court ? look at this matter with new eyes.\"  But for his part, Russell said his court isn\\'t entertaining any motions for reconsideration.  \"The complexity of comprehending and analyzing lengthy interrelated documents and deciphering the nuisances therein has been time-consuming on the part of counsel and the Court,\" the opinion said. \"Frankly, the court has given this matter its best shot.\"  Did you find this article useful?

       " 'Tips for cheaper flying Already dreaming of your next holiday? Here\\'s how to get the best deals.  If you are looking to book the cheapest flight possible, travel on a Wednesday and book your airfare about six weeks out. And whatever you do, keep your browsing top secret and don\\'t go during the school holidays.  With more Kiwis than ever taking off for a break overseas, the Herald on Sunday has compiled a list of tips to help you spend less on airfares and save more of your holiday budget for fun.  Aviation commentator Peter Clark recommended using web search engines like WebJet, Skyscanner or Expedia to research fares but said to make sure you knew what you wanted before doing so because as soon as airlines got wind that people were searching for a particular flight, prices rose. \"Know where you want to go and when. Search with a purpose.\"  He also said to get in early or wait to the last minute because that\\'s when flights were usually cheapest. \"Airlines need bums on seats.\"  Travel website Thrifty Nomads suggested keeping searches private because flight prices increased when a route was repeatedly searched.  \"The site wants to scare you into booking the flight quickly before prices get even higher. Always search in private browsing mode to see the lowest prices.\"  The way to open an incognito window in Google Chrome or Safari is hit Command, Shift, N.  For Mozilla Firefox or Internet Explorer, hit Command (or \"Control\" if using a PC), Shift, P.  The website also said sometimes a flight connecting to a city you want to go to is cheaper than flying directly to it. This is known as \"hidden city\" flying. A search engine called Skiplagged locates these flights.  But this trick - frowned upon by airlines - should be used with caution because if the flight you\\'re on happens to be the same one continuing to the final destination, you may not be allowed to disembark the plane. Also, you won\\'t be able to check-in any luggage as this will arrive at the final destination, rather than the stop-over.  House of Travel commercial director Brent Thomas said the one thing to never do if you\\'re looking for cheap flights is to travel during the school holidays.  \"I can\\'t emphasise that enough. Don\\'t fly then, whatever you do. It\\'s the peak of all travel.\"  There are also are a couple of big sales during the year when long-haul airfares are competitively priced - one is the New Year sale, which is taking place now. Others sell shoulder season fares.  The travel centre is offering up to 50 per cent off Fiji, Queensland and Rarotonga resorts.  Thomas said to be mindful of the complete cost of flying, so although a flight might be \"super cheap\" it could arrive at 2am and require a hotel stay, so a midafternoon arrival might end up cheaper.  flightsecrets10',\n",

       " 'UPDATE 1-Investors pump $10 bln into U.S. stock funds in weekly period -Lipper  (Adds data on mutual funds and ETFs)     By Trevor Hunnicutt     NEW YORK, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Investors pumped $10 billion into U.S.-based stock funds in the week that ended Dec. 30, Lipper data showed on Thursday, demonstrating a willingness to take on risk at the end of a year that has delivered slim gains to financial markets.     Funds tracking foreign stocks took in money from both mutual fund and exchange-traded fund investors during the week - $9.3 billion in all, Lipper said - one week after such funds suffered a historic outflow.     The new money should come as a relief to stockpickers and index-funds tracking the equity markets, whose funds had previously posted four consecutive weeks of outflows that totalled $30 billion as investors digested risks to the global economy and an interest-rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.     The $10 billion pulled out of \"non-domestic\" stock funds during the week ended Dec. 23 was the largest ever recorded by Lipper, whose data dates to 1992. The week before that saw an outflow from investment-grade bond funds of $5.1 billion that was also the largest since such record-keeping began.      U.S. taxable bond funds posted $1.8 billion in outflows over the past week, Lipper data showed, the sixth straight week of outflows. Investment-grade debt funds continued to post outflows: this week the withdrawals totalled $1.7 billion.     Yet even in bonds, there were green shoots of optimism. Exchange-traded fund investors added net money to the funds even as mutual-fund owners pulled out.     High-yield bond funds ended what had been a three-week streak of multibillion-dollar outflows, taking in $114 million in new money, as fears abated that tanking energy and commodity prices would sink debt-laden corporate issuers and fund managers who had feasted on such debt.     Emerging-market stock funds added $168 million in new money from investors, their first net inflows since October, according to Lipper.     Money-market funds took in nearly $17 billion in new money during the week, according to the fund data service.     The Lipper fund flow data is compiled from reports issued by U.S.-domiciled mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.     The following is a broad breakdown of the flows for the week, including exchange-traded funds (in $ billions):  Sector          Flow Chg  % Assets  Assets     Count                  ($Bil)              ($Bil)       All Equity      10.050    0.20      5,141.025  11,901  Funds                                            Domestic        0.792     0.02      3,626.019  8,476  Equities                                         Non-Domestic    9.258     0.61      1,515.006  3,425  Equities                                         All Taxable     -1.796    -0.08     2,161.482  6,104  Bond Funds                                       All Money       16.962    0.74      2,309.528  1,141  Market Funds                                     All Municipal   1.299     0.36      358.919    1,50  Bond Funds                                         (Reporting by Trevor Hunnicutt; Editing by Chris Reese and Tom Brown)  Released: 2016-1-1T01:10:51.000Z',\n",
       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING StanChart jumps after analysts say it is \\'undervalued\\' by 50%; London Standard Chartered led a London market rally yesterday after JPMorgan Cazenove said the bank was at least 50 per cent undervalued versus its peers.  Capital concerns had been addressed by a $5.2bn rights issue , said the broker, which was joint co-ordinator and underwriter to the cash call.  It forecast that even if loan defaults returned to the levels of the 1997 Asian crisis, StanChart\\'s capital buffer would remain in the management\\'s target range. Downside protection came from StanChart\\'s new strategy to shrink risk-weighted assets by a third and move away from low-return business, with rising US interest rates providing a tailwind, JPMorgan said.  Yet the shares were trading at half their 2016 tangible net asset value and less than 10 times next year\\'s earnings, falling to just five times earnings in 2018, it forecast as it repeated an 870p target price.  StanChart shares gained 6.4 per cent to 512.7p.  A thinly traded wider market squeezed the FTSE 100 higher by 0.7 per cent, or 43.4 points, to 6,061.19.  Shire took on 3.9 per cent to £43.47 after Flemming Ornskov , chief executive, once again stressed to US investors that he was prepared to abandon the pursuit of fellow drugmaker Baxalta .  Leerink analysts reckoned that if Shire walked away from the potential acquisition its shares would rally at least 20 per cent.  Cowen & Co repeated its longstanding \"outperform\" advice on Shire. \"If there is perceived value in an Allergan/ Valeant model, then Shire - either standalone or via the combination with Baxalta - provides higher-quality organic growth with a cleaner balance sheet that will allow for more thoughtful and value-creating business development at a compelling valuation,\" it told clients.  Pearson , the textbook publisher, bounced 5.2 per cent to 743.5p after Exane said the risk to earnings was already reflected in an \"all-time low valuation\". The upgrade eclipsed US data showing autumn college enrolments down 1.7 per cent.  Under new chairman Sidney Taurel , Pearson was likely to begin \"a profound refocusing\" that would rein back global ambitions and should include share buybacks, Exane said.  \"Headwinds should abate in 2017 as the education policy reforms ease, US enrolment benefits from the move to free college tuition, and with positive structural drivers continuing to offset the negative pressure,\" it added.  Arm Holdings lost 2.9 per cent to £10.21 on a revival of worries about slowing smartphone demand, fed in part by Tuesday\\'s warning of weak demand from Apple supplier Dialog Semiconductor. Credit Suisse cut its Arm forecasts out to 2018 to reflect a \"saturated\" smartphone market.  Retailers faded on a profit warning from Bonmarche , the older women\\'s clothing specialist, which fell 29.2 per cent to 210p. N Brown declined 6 per cent to 301.7p and Asos was off 6.2 per cent to £32.51.',\n",

The fund committed to allocating 10% of its portfolio to early stage investment managers with strong performance and is well on its way to achieving that goal.  The first Next Generation open house will be held at the fund offices on December 10, 2015. The keynote speaker will be Jason R. Howard, Director of Investments at GCM Grosvenor one of the world\\'s largest and most diversified independent alternative asset management firms.  In order to increase opportunities it has launched the Next Generation Manager program to generate interest among minorities who have not considered such careers, provide access to investment opportunities that may otherwise be overlooked, and discover and cultivate the next generation of external portfolio management talent.  The program will host quarterly open houses in Dallas with the goal to provide new managers with an opportunity to learn about the Fund, investment goals and the process to hire managers. Each open house will feature a guest speaker to discuss an aspect of the investment process. Open houses are limited to 30 attendees to promote conversation and interaction.  \"Next Generation Managers conferences and seminars will provide an opportunity to learn about ERF including the organization, investment goals and the process by which it hires and monitors investment managers,\" said Carla D. Brewer, ERF Board Chairman. \"In addition, accomplished speakers with diverse backgrounds will provide helpful insights into their professional journey and building their respective businesses.\"  \"This program is not about diversity for diversity\\'s sake,\" said Cheryl Alston, ERF Executive Director. \"It is about having the very best returns for the current and retired Dallas city employees we serve.  Our speaker has been a success in this field and will be a terrific role model and mentor for others who want to succeed.\"  According to statistics published in Asset International, Inc., \"nearly 90% of senior money managers in the U.S. are white,\" women and minorities make up only a tiny fraction of senior asset managers.  \"We look forward to opening up new opportunities for managers who can help us now as well as encouraging a more diverse group of professionals to enter the field,\" said Alston. \"We want the best minds working hard to provide the retirement security our city employees have worked so hard to earn.\"  Registration for the program is open at the ERF web site www.dallaserf.org/events  SOURCE Employees\\' Retirement Fund of the City of Dallas  Employees\\' Retirement Fund of the City of Dallas  Keywords for this news article include: Investment and Finance, Employees\\' Retirement Fund of the City of Dallas.

       " '3 Things Car Dealers Never Want to Hear You Say Remember these words next time you are haggling at the dealership.  Most of us know that there are certain things you\\'re supposed to do and not do when buying a car, but it can still be a struggle to put those principles into words. For the most part, car-buying remains a tough negotiation. And you\\'re at a disadvantage: The sales representative does deals every day, and you don\\'t. He knows what to say; you don\\'t.  Here are three situations you\\'re likely to face in your next car-buying adventure -- and our suggested responses, which will keep the conversation going the way you want and lead to the best price you can get.  \\'Thanks, I may consider your trade-in offer\\'  Dealerships like trade-ins. It gets them inventory for their used car lot on the cheap. So don\\'t be surprised if you get offered money for whatever you drove to the dealership. The offer might even sound surprisingly good.  But don\\'t bite quite yet. Your answer? \"Thanks, I may consider your trade-in offer. But that\\'s separate from how we\\'re going to price the new car.\" The point is this: It\\'s hard enough to keep track of one price as you\\'re negotiating. Once you\\'ve gotten close to final on the new buy, you can entertain the trade-in bid. If you\\'ve done your research, you know what your car is worth and can take it or leave it.  \\'Let me see the invoice, please\\'  It\\'s hard to buy a car without a lot of extra fees. But not all fees are created equal. When you last bought a shirt, did the store charge you to take it off the hanger? So, don\\'t pay money for silly things like vehicle prep fees for pulling shipping plastic off your new ride and making sure it has oil in it. When the dealer tells you \"everyone pays these\", your line is, \"Let me see the invoice, please.\" Legitimate fees are listed there.  \\'No, thank you\\'  Finally, you can expect to be offered all kinds of stuff once you hit the dealership\\'s Finance and Insurance office, from window etching to protection plans for your key fobs. The line you\\'re going to need to use here the most is simply, \"No, thank you.\" Mud flaps, rust-proofing and paint sealants make the dealer a lot of money, but you can often get these for less elsewhere--assuming you want them in the first place. Look at a catalog such as AutoSport for accessories, or check your local detailing shop for paint sealant or fabric treatments. If you later decide you just really have to have those chrome running boards, you can always come back to the dealer.  Here are three more smart things to say at the car dealership.

       " \"Year in review: New Mexico's biggest health care issues of 2015 For New Mexico businesses, the 2015 conversation around health care largely revolved around one thing: costs.  How to pay for health insurance coverage. Who had the best small group and large group rates. Who is selling plans on the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange. How rates change and what businesses can do to defray costs.  Here are some of the key health care issues that cropped up locally and across the state.  The growing burden of health insurance costs on business  Many felt the heat of growing health care costs this year. For businesses, those costs largely focused on increasing insurance premium rates, as well as penalty bumps for failing to provide adequate insurance coverage for employees.  While the implementation of the Affordable Care Act meant that more people had access to health insurance without discrimination, underwriting changes have meant that employers pay more in insurance premiums for older employees or those that smoke than they do for younger employees - even if those individuals are more unhealthy. Employer mandate changes in 2015, too, meant that more businesses were required to provide health insurance this year.  Insurance rates and a major insurer's exit from the exchange  Just as small businesses felt the crunch of health care costs, so did insurers. Underestimated claims costs factored into Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New Mexico's decision to pull its individual product offerings from the New Mexico Health Insurance Exchange in 2016. The move left thousands scrambling to find new coverage and resulted in New Mexico Health Connections decision to drop its PPO plan from the exchange. NMHC also cited high claims costs associated with the plan, as well as a lack of market competition in its decision.  The costs of Medicaid expansion - both good and bad  New Mexico was one of several states to expand access to Medicaid - something that was a boon for hospitals and insurers such as UnitedHealthcare alike - as Chuck Milligan, chief executive officer of UnitedHealthcare Community Plan of New Mexico - put it. But the costs of that expansion are hefty - total expenditures in 2015 are expected to balloon by $1 billion. While the federal government is footing the bill for Medicaid costs for another year, New Mexico will be on the hook for some of those costs starting in 2017, an estimated $120 million.  Electronic health records  Less an issue and more a trend, 2015 was the year of using technology to access your electronic health records. Several health care providers launched Web portals and mobile apps that facilitated consumer access to personal health record information. From Presbyterian Healthcare Services to Lovelace Health System to insurance carrier New Mexico Health Connections, the power of technology was put in the hands of consumers - in part to comply with ACA requirements.

       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING Puerto Rico avoids defaulting on debt; Capital markets Development bank makes last-minute payment as deficit looms this month  Puerto Rico has avoided defaulting on more than $350m of its obligations, in the latest chapter of the island\\'s struggle to deal with $72bn in debts.  The commonwealth \"narrowly avoided a complete default that could have hobbled its government . . . by resolving to unsustainable financial gymnastics\", said Richard Blumenthal, Democratic senator from Connecticut, at a Congressional hearing yesterday.  In a statement the Government Development Bank confirmed that it had paid all principal and interest payments due on certain outstanding notes.  With cash dwindling, the development bank has embarked on extraordinary measures - including delaying tax returns - to keep its balance from turning negative. However, those actions are no longer enough to keep Puerto Rico from falling into deficit this month.  The island would begin to claw back revenue from other income sources to maintain \"essential public services\", said Alejandro García Padilla, the governor, in testimony in front of the Senate.  He has previously described the debt burden as \"unpayable\".  \"We have taken this step in the trust that Congress will act. But do not be misled.  We have no resources left. Puerto Rico cannot keep this up longer.\" The debt payment yesterday included $273m of GDB obligations backed by the commonwealth\\'s general obligation guarantee, according to Moody\\'s. Analysts with the rating agency had warned that if Puerto Rico was to default it would have been on a payment of about $81m owed by the GDB that, unlike general obligation-backed notes, did not benefit from constitutional protection.  Paper issued by the GDB maturing in August 2019 traded higher after the hearing, ticking up to 27.75 cents on the dollar from 26.64 cents a day earlier, according to data from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. They started the year trading at 63 cents.  \"They\\'ve been on the brink for a long time,\" said David Kotok, chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors, which holds some insured Puerto Rican debt.  Ted Hampton, an analyst with Moody\\'s, said: \"The key security here is the guaranteed-GDB notes because once those are defaulted on, that has implications for all of the debt that is protected by Puerto Rico\\'s constitution.\" Far larger payments are due on January 1, and Mr Hampton noted that a payment yesterday would not change Moody\\'s view that default in the coming months was likely.  Mr García Padilla, who has seen his popularity erode sharply in recent polls, alongside flight to the mainland and lacklustre economic conditions, testified alongside the island\\'s sole member of Congress, Pedro Pierluisi, and Richard Carrión, chairman of Banco Popular.  An Obama administration plan put forward in October, which would amend the bankruptcy code, instate a financial control board and extend tax credits to Puerto Rico, is thought to face high hurdles in Congress. Investors object in particular to holiday bonuses set aside for the island\\'s government workers.',\n",
       " 'Financial Post New royalty regime will cripple a few, economist says; \\'Period of disruption\\' LAKE LOUISE, Alta Not every Alberta oil and gas company will be able to compete with U.S. shale gas under recommended changes to the Alberta royalty regime but change is needed and will be delivered on time, says a member of the review committee.  Energy economist Peter Tertzakian of ARC Financial Corp. told reporters at a business conference in Lake Louise on Friday that industry members who called for zero change to the royalty regime in Alberta will be disappointed when the results are turned over to Energy Minister Marg McCuaig-Boyd before the end of the year.  \"I am confident that \\'segments\\' of the industry will remain competitive,\" he said, when asked if the industry will be able to compete on costs with burgeoning new shale plays in the United States under the recommended new rules.  \"This is a very major period of disruption in the world of energy and companies and institutions that are able to adapt will definitely be competitive. But whenever you have change of this magnitude, there are always elements of the industry that cannot be competitive and we just have to move forward.\"  Murray Edwards, co-host of the Bennett Jones Lake Louise World Cup Business Forum and chairman of Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., said he supports the efforts of the panel and listed benefits, including simplification, that he hopes will result.  \"We do have to change the way we\\'re doing things in the province,\" he told the audience. \"To continue the analogy, I think we have in this industry, in this province, for far too long, been playing checkers when we should be playing chess.\"  Tertzakian said the panel, which includes chair David Mowat of ATB Financial, former deputy minister of finance Annette Trimbee and Beaverlodge, Alta., Mayor Leona Hanson, is trying to \"modernize\" the royalty system, and creating a \"better machine going forward.\" He said the royalty panel is keeping in touch with and ensuring harmonization with the climate change review panel whose results were released last week. He said he was heartened by the general acceptance of the climate change panel\\'s recommendations.  During his speech, Tertzakian said retaining the existing royalty regime - designed to resolve \"unintended consequences\" from the system brought in under former premier Ed Stelmach eight years ago - isn\\'t an option.  \"It\\'s way too complicated. It\\'s got what I call distortions. It doesn\\'t give the right incentives to go after the highest value products,\" he said.  \"It\\'s not transparent. It\\'s ephemeral, the programs expire. How is that supposed to be something that breeds any sort of certainty in what we\\'re supposed to be doing going forward?\" The royalty rate on a well in Alberta can vary between 10 and 40 per cent depending upon what mix of oil, gas and natural gas liquids it produces, something that isn\\'t known before drilling begins, Tertzakian noted.',\n",
       " \"Sport Birmingham City Black Friday bargains: The cut-price deals that Gary Rowett should consider in the January transfer window Here are some suggestions that could prove to be value for money for a club in Blues' position...  It's Black Friday, the day whenever consumers are encouraged to go bargain-hunting.  So, now that the loan window is closed, we've decided to have a look at what cut-price deals Birmingham City could do during the January transfer window.  With his budget not being the biggest, Gary Rowett will have to spend smartly to pick out the right players to aid Blues' promotion tilt after Christmas.  Here are some suggestions that could prove to be value for money for a club in Blues' position...  The Newcastle United striker has flourished during a loan spell at Coventry City this season. He is currently the top scorer in League One with 12 goals to his name in 14 appearances.  The youngster is the main reason the Sky Blues sit top of the third tier at present, but with his loan up in January, his parent club might want him to be tested in a higher division.  A host of clubs would be interested in the diminutive youngster, but Blues' record of bringing through their own youngsters could work in their favour.  The ex-West Bromwich Albion trainee has started the season on fire for Oxford United as they sit second in League Two.  The midfielder has already notched 11 goals this campaign with eight of them coming in the league. Blues would face stiff competition from Premier League sides Newcastle and Stoke City, but would be able to offer Roofe first team football.  The Leyton Orient goal-getter has already bagged 14 goals this season, all of which have come in the league as the Londoners look to make an immediate return to League One after relegation last term. Orient probably wouldn't be able to command a big fee for the 26-year-old, with this already proving to be the highest scoring season of his career.  The Greek has been without a club since leaving Albion over the summer and could represent great value for money should Blues try to lure him to St Andrew's and help him find form. He hasn't been prolific throughout his career, but he is very much thought of as someone who can do a job for the team. Clayton Donaldson has been given a heavy workload recently and the potential signing of Samaras could take some of the weight off the newly-capped Jamaica international.  Pennant is still without a club after leaving Wigan Athletic in the close season. The winger made 60 appearances for Blues during a successful 18-month spell before joining Liverpool where he went on to feature in the 2007 Champions League Final defeat to AC Milan. The winger would provide competition for Welshman David Cotterill and would add some extra experience to the Blues ranks.  Blues latest\",\n",
       " 'News BIGGER PENSION PAYOUTS FOR ALL £170 a year pension boost for 13million  MILLIONS of pensioners are to see their spending power boosted to its highest level for a quarter of a century.  The basic state pension will rise to £119.30 a week from April, sc* Chancellor George Osborne will announce in next week\\'s Autumn Statement. The most people can get at present is £115.95 a week. The increase of £3.35 a week will mean 13 million people will be £174.20 a year better off as a result.  The 2.9 per cent increase will be the biggest in real terms since 2001and, as a share of average earnings, the highest since 1991.  Steve Wilkie, managing director of retirement specialists Responsible Life, said: \"This is cracking news for pensioners, especially as it has been another tough year for many, with savings income still in the doldrums as a result of stagnant interest rates.\"  The triple lock guarantee, introduced by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition, pledged state pension payments would rise in line with whichever is the highest of earnings, inflation or 2.5 per cent.  The 2.9 per cent rise is linked to average earnings.  Alongside the increase in the basic state pension, Mr Osborne will confirm that the starting rate for the new single-tier pension - for those who retire after April - will be around £155 a week.  Pensions minister Dr Ros Altmann said yesterday: \"Over the last quarter of a century pensioners have fallen below the rest of society as average earnings have done so much better than the increases in the state pension. Since 2010 we have really begun to correct that.  \"We are now back to the highest level for a quarter of a century - and quite right too. Pensioners deserve to be treated much better than they have been in the past.  \"They\\'ve done their best for society, worked hard and we owe them. This Government has restored a decent level of state pension and we have further to go. The new single-tier pension will particularly help women and the self-employed.\" Some experts say the triple lock guarantee is putting too heavy a burden on taxpayers, however. The bill next year will be about £95billion.  Keith Richards, of the Personal Finance Society, said: \"This 2.9 per cent rise is undoubtedly good news for pensioners but the variables used to determine the increase highlight the considerable risk that the triple-lock policy has for the public finances.  \"At a time when other countries are trying to de-risk pension provision, we seem to be increasing the risk of ours which will ultimately have to be addressed, with the impact being borne by future generations.  \"The new pension freedoms encourage short-term spending of pension pots, which is generating significant tax revenue for the Chancellor. This is likely to result in more retirees exhausting what savings they have too early and needing greater support from the welfare system.\"',\n",

Most of us know that there are certain things you\\'re supposed to do and not do when buying a car, but it can still be a struggle to put those principles into words. For the most part, car-buying remains a tough negotiation. And you\\'re at a disadvantage: The sales representative does deals every day, and you don\\'t. He knows what to say; you don\\'t.  Here are three situations you\\'re likely to face in your next car-buying adventure -- and our suggested responses, which will keep the conversation going the way you want and lead to the best price you can get.  \\'Thanks, I may consider your trade-in offer\\'  Dealerships like trade-ins. It gets them inventory for their used car lot on the cheap. So don\\'t be surprised if you get offered money for whatever you drove to the dealership. The offer might even sound surprisingly good.  But don\\'t bite quite yet. Your answer? \"Thanks, I may consider your trade-in offer. But that\\'s separate from how we\\'re going to price the new car.\" The point is this: It\\'s hard enough to keep track of one price as you\\'re negotiating. Once you\\'ve gotten close to final on the new buy, you can entertain the trade-in bid. If you\\'ve done your research, you know what your car is worth and can take it or leave it.  \\'Let me see the invoice, please\\'  It\\'s hard to buy a car without a lot of extra fees. But not all fees are created equal. When you last bought a shirt, did the store charge you to take it off the hanger? So, don\\'t pay money for silly things like vehicle prep fees for pulling shipping plastic off your new ride and making sure it has oil in it. When the dealer tells you \"everyone pays these\", your line is, \"Let me see the invoice, please.\" Legitimate fees are listed there.  \\'No, thank you\\'  Finally, you can expect to be offered all kinds of stuff once you hit the dealership\\'s Finance and Insurance office, from window etching to protection plans for your key fobs. The line you\\'re going to need to use here the most is simply, \"No, thank you.\" Mud flaps, rust-proofing and paint sealants make the dealer a lot of money, but you can often get these for less elsewhere--assuming you want them in the first place. Look at a catalog such as AutoSport for accessories, or check your local detailing shop for paint sealant or fabric treatments. If you later decide you just really have to have those chrome running boards, you can always come back to the dealer.  Here are three more smart things to say at the car dealership.

       " 'House to float bill to replace DOL fiduciary rule; Lawmakers release \\'legislative principles\\' for retirement advisers A bipartisan group of House members is working on a bill that would offer an alternative to a pending Labor Department proposal to raise investment advice standards for retirement accounts.  The lawmakers released what they called \"legislative principles\" last Thursday that will be reflected in the measure.  The principles include requiring advisers to work in their clients\\' best interests; providing \"clear, simple and relevant disclosure of material conflicts,\" including compensation and fees; and preserving proprietary products, commission-based sales and annuities.  Authors of the bill - Reps. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., Richard Neal, D-Mass., Phil Roe, R-Tenn., and Michelle Lujan Grisham, D-N.M. - said they are concerned the DOL rule, which is designed to reduce advisers\\' conflicts of interest, would have \"unintended negative consequences\" for people with modest assets.  \\'RULE\\'S IMPACT\\'  \"We acknowledge the Department of Labor\\'s pledge to change aspects of the regulation before final issuance, but feel more must be done to adequately address concerns about the rule\\'s impact on the ability of low- and middle-class families to save for retirement,\" the legislators said in a joint statement.  They added, \"If a final rule has flaws, damage can be done upon the rule\\'s release due to the immediate changes the retirement savings industry would have to make and the likelihood that those changes could limit access to services and education for those saving to retire.\"  A DOL spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.  It\\'s not clear when the bill will be introduced or whether it will require the DOL to halt the rule. Mr. Neal and Ms. Grisham were among the nearly united Democratic caucus that voted against a bill Oct. 27 that would stop the DOL proposal in its tracks.  Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America and an advocate for the rule, said it already meets the standards outlined by the lawmakers, and that their principles are short on details. She criticized the legislative framework for emphasizing disclosure rather than mitigation of conflicts, and not mentioning enforcement mechanisms.  \\'INDUSTRY BIDDING\\'  \"It sounds to me as though they are simply doing industry bidding by creating a best-interest standard in name only,\" Ms. Roper wrote in an email. \"That has nothing to do with protecting small savers. It is all about protecting industry\\'s bottom line.\"  The DOL proposal was released in April with White House backing and has gone through two comment periods and four days of hearings. A final rule is expected early next year so it can be finalized before the Obama administration leaves office.  Proponents say advice standards must be raised in order to protect investors from high-fee products that erode retirement savings. The industry argues the rule will significantly increase liability risk and regulatory costs for brokers, making advice more expensive to give and receive.  Twitter: @markschoeff',\n",

They will get a slight bump up when the Federal Reserve raises short-term rates in December for the first time since the recession. And 30-year fixed rate mortgages will wind up at 4.0% at the end of this year, versus 3.9% now. By the end of 2016, two expected Fed rate increases should push the 10-year Treasury bond rate to 2.7% and the 30-year mortgage rate to 4.4%.  See Also: All Our Economic Outlooks  Long-term rates will stay relatively low because U.S. Treasuries will continue to be attractive, given that:  Consumer prices in the U.S. are unlikely to rev up much anytime soon. Although energy prices could bounce back a bit, the Fed tends to discount these. Prices excluding food and energy have been fairly stable at about 1.6% to 1.9% for several years now, and the rise in the dollar will keep prices for imported commodities lower.  China's growth is likely to continue slowing, keeping its central bank committed to easier monetary policy. It recently cut its main interest rate for the sixth time in less than a year.  The European Central Bank will stay on its expansionary path, despite improving growth in Europe. The ECB intends to keep buying 60 billion euros' worth of bonds a month until September 2016, a substantial share of the Eurobond market. Likewise, Japan's central bank will continue its easing policies.  The Fed won't want to further boost the value of the dollar by making it even more attractive with higher rates, so it will be sparing with rate increases.  We expect the Federal Reserve to bump up short-term interest rates by a quarter-point at its December 16 meeting. But we don't see a second hike until several months later. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen has signaled that the Fed won't increase rates at every meeting, as it did between 2004 and 2006 under former Chair Alan Greenspan. Yellen wants to be able to evaluate the impact of each hike before pulling the trigger on the next one.  Copyright 2015 The Kiplinger Washington Editors\",\n",
       " '\\'Â£44,000 PREMIUM\\' FOR HOME BUYERS TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE Home buyers pay a premium of nearly £44,000 typically to live in the countryside, according to a report, with Tandridge in Surrey named as the least affordable rural district in Britain.  At £236,971 on average, a home in a rural area costs £43,490 or more than a fifth (22%) more than a property in a town or a city, according to the Halifax Rural Housing Review.  It said the gap is making it difficult for first-time buyers on average incomes in southern England in particular to get a foothold on the property ladder.  Across Britain, the biggest urban/rural house price gap was found in the West Midlands, where it costs 50% or £84,610 more to live in the countryside.  Buyers looking to live in a rural setting end up paying around seven times their annual earnings for a home, while city dwellers will pay 5.9 times their annual wage for a property typically, according to the report, which excluded London from the findings.  At £433,932, the typical house price in Tandridge costs 10.8 times local average earnings.  Buyers looking for value may want to consider Copeland in west Cumbria, which was identified as the most affordable rural district in Britain. A property there costs around £140,364, setting someone back 3.7 times the local average wage.  The research also found that first-time buyers make up 42% of house purchases with a mortgage in rural areas, compared with 54% in urban areas.  There were huge variations across the country, with first-time buyers making up nearly two-thirds (62%) of purchases in Pendle in Lancashire compared with just 20% of purchases in Purbeck in the South West.  Craig McKinlay, mortgage director at Halifax, said: \"Many home owners aspire to live in the countryside, attracted by the prospect of a better quality of life, open space and a cleaner environment.  \"However, realisation of this dream comes at a cost with average property values typically over a fifth higher than in urban areas.  \"A side-effect of rising property values is that housing affordability has become an increasing concern in many rural areas. This is particularly true in the South where those on average incomes find it very difficult to enter the market.\"  A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said: \"We want to ensure that anyone who works hard and aspires to own their own home can turn their dream into a reality.  \"We are making this happen by delivering 200,000 Starter Homes at a 20% discount - and we will change planning rules so that where there is local support, they can be built in rural villages.  \"We have got Britain building again and latest figures show that new homes are up by 9% on this time last year, with more than 85,000 high quality affordable homes built in the past five years in rural areas.\"  ends',\n",
       " 'DWP select committee launches inquiry into introduction of state pension The introduction of the state pension from April 2016 will be scrutinised through an inquiry by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) select committee.  MP Frank Field who chairs the select committee said there needed to be clarity for people about how they would be affected by changes once they claimed their pension.  Complexities arising out of the transition from the current system to the single tier state pension were raised in July when the government published a 26-point fact sheet outlining the transitional arrangements for people who had been contracted-out.  Field said: \"There is a sense that government has somewhat moved the goalposts in retirement savings without providing enough information about what are, in the end, complex changes, and a risk that some people may face a shock when they come to claim their pension.  \"It is important that groups most affected by the changes receive targeted communications that highlight the options available to them.\"  One group of people who felt especially aggrieved by the reforms were women born between 1951 and 1953, he added.  Hargreaves Lansdown head of retirement policy Tom McPhail added: \"The state pension reforms will ultimately lead to a simpler, more equal system and no one disputes that the transition from the current system to the new one will involve complex adjustments.  \"What is incomprehensible though is that until recently the DWP seems not to have made any meaningful plans to communicate these changes to the people who are actually affected by them.\"  Tips for DWP to help people understand state pension  Create a number of online tools which will:  - Allow anyone of any age to log in and see what their own personal state pension entitlement is, based on their national insurance (NI) history to date.  - Explore what their state pension entitlement is under the old and new systems so they can see how the changes will affect them.  - See what gaps they have in their NI history.  - Show both the cost of buying the extra state pension and also what additional income they would be entitled to as a consequence.  - Explore the cost and benefit of deferring their state pension for a period of time. This should include a life-expectancy forecaster and a \\'payoff\\' projection so they could see how long they would have to live for to benefit.  - Forecast how much their state pension will increase by in the future if they work and pay NI between now and state pension age.  - Run through the contracted out deduction which is applied to state pension entitlements so people can see how much of their state pension is (at least theoretically) being replaced by their private pension  In addition the government could:  - Abolish the requirement to pay full rate NI once you have qualified for the full state pension.  - Train DWP employees to able to talk to people and explain how all this works.

       " 'NATIONAL NEWS CBI warns of added costs from pensions \\'tinkering\\'; Regulatory changes \"Constant tinkering\" with pensions rules is saddling British business with unmanageable cost and compliance burdens, company chiefs have warned.  The CBI employers\\' group surveyed 160 businesses employing more than half a million people and found that eight of out 10 executives think the government should stop making changes to the pensions regime, following a series of complex reforms.  Business leaders are also concerned staff may stop saving for their retirement if tax benefits continue to be eroded as pensions become more complicated, the CBI found.  \"Recent regulatory changes, coupled with auto-enrolment and state pension reform, mean UK business leaders now crave stability,\" said Neil Carberry, the CBI\\'s director of employment and skills.  \"Businesses want to focus on ensuring employees are making the most of what\\'s on offer, but there is clear concern about regulatory changes eroding incentives to save, which must be avoided at all costs.\"  Recent changes to the pensions regime include the requirement for employees to be automatically enrolled in company pension schemes instead of being able to opt out, a policy introduced by the coalition government. This is being extended to companies with fewer than 30 employees, as well as people with household staff.  Pension freedoms were also creating a human resources burden, the CBI said, as company leaders tried to ensure their older staff did not spend their pension pots early and face hanging on to their jobs when they should have retired.  \"Even at this early stage it is clear that succession planning is likely to become more difficult,\" the CBI said.  \"The challenge the pensions freedoms bring for businesses is that employees risk not being able to afford to retire if they choose to spend a significant chunk of their pension pot on reaching 55 years of age while remaining in their jobs.\"  Companies are grappling with \" pensions freedoms \" that allow over-55s to cash in their annuities and also the move, planned for next year, to replace the current, multi-faceted statepension regime with a single plan.  According to the CBI, the cost of running auto-enrolment processes has been higher than expected for those companies already in the programme. The employers\\' group was concerned, it said in a report accompanying its survey, that smaller companies would \"struggle with the process\" and have difficulties with \"ongoing compliance\".  Other recent changes had had a \"worrying impact\", the CBI reported, such as the maximum amount that could be saved in a pension pot tax-free coming down from £1.8m in 2011 to a proposed £1m next year.  This development, the CBI said, meant businesses were worried employees would not see the value of saving into a pension. This was also reducing companies\\' ability to use pensions as their \"core recruitment, retention and motivation tool\".  The survey found 80 per cent of business leaders are urging the government not to make any more changes to the system of pension tax relief.',\n",
       " 'Money Keys to keeping lid on spending Her Money  Each week Fairfax personal finance editor Sally Patten will point out the steps women can take to secure their financial future.  If you are not across your household\\'s financial statements, you should be.  That is the advice of Claire Mackay, an adviser at Quantum Financial.  The reason is simple. \"If you don\\'t know where you spend money, you won\\'t know where you can save.\" And why is this so important?  You might think that being wealthy, or at least comfortably off, depends on what you earn, but in fact, argues this financial adviser, there is more to it. Being wealthy depends on how much you spend.  \"My wealthiest clients know exactly where all their money goes,\" Mackay says. She adds that invariably clients can find ways to reduce their spending if they need to, even if it is changing to a cheaper mobile phone plan or reviewing their electricity, gas or insurance arrangements.  There are two things you need to understand about your finances. The first is the so-called balance sheet, which shows what investments you own and how much debt, or borrowings, you have.  The investments might be an investment property, shares, money in a bank account or superannuation savings. The debt you owe might be a mortgage, any debt on your credit cards or other car or personal loans.  The balance sheet part is important when it comes to retirement because you will need to rely on these investments to support you when you are no longer earning a salary.  The other area of your finances that you should be on top of is the day-to-day stuff; in other words, your monthly or annual income and your expenses.  When you think of your salary, don\\'t think about it in gross terms, but the amount you receive after tax and super contributions have been deducted - your net salary.  When calculating your expenses, you should include everything from groceries and your daily coffee bill to your expenditure on rates, entertainment, clothing, car insurance and your telecommunications.  Longer term, the idea is to arrange your income and expenses in such a way to allow you to shift the money you receive via your salary to the investments that appear on the household balance sheet - although in the shorter term the money may be shifted to separate holiday or school fee accounts.  Once you are retired, you won\\'t want to have much debt hanging around, so the idea is to gradually pay down borrowings.  The bottom line is you need to understand your financial position - what is going on in terms of your assets and borrowings, income and expenses. Ultimately you need to know if you are converting income into assets.The information in this article should not be taken as financial advice.

       " 'Life How Much Retirement Income Will You Need? Maybe Less Than You Think; New research calls the venerable 80% income-replacement rule into question New research indicates that retirees-especially in higher income brackets-might need to replace less of their pre-retirement income than they think.  Financial planners have long suggested that individuals replace 80% of their income in retirement from various sources to maintain the same standard of living they had while working.  But in a recent article in Research magazine, Michael Finke, a professor at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, notes that the rule doesn\\'t necessarily reflect how a person\\'s income grows while he or she is working-nor how expenses change and even decline in retirement. What\\'s more, the guideline focuses on gross income rather than take-home pay.  Consider: In retirement, you likely no longer contribute to Social Security, Medicare and your retirement account. That means your replacement rate is down to no more than 77% of your final year\\'s salary-or 60% or less if you use average lifetime income, Prof. Finke says.  If you subtract other expenses-commuting and a lower federal income-tax bill (assuming you\\'re in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you were in your working years)-the replacement rate falls lower still.  \"The 80% rule is wrong because it\\'s too simplistic,\" Prof. Finke says. \"Most of us don\\'t want to replace our gross income. We want to replace our paycheck.\"  The guideline, he adds, is especially distorted for high-income Americans.  \"The highest 20% of earners aren\\'t even spending half of their gross income,\" he says. \"So if you think they need 80% of their gross income, then they\\'d have to spend more in retirement than they\\'d ever spent during their working years-and this doesn\\'t sound like a good life plan.\"  So, what\\'s a better way to figure out how much income you need?  First, if you\\'re at, or very near, retirement, you can use your actual target consumption, says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chicago-based fund-research company Morningstar Inc. For those still several years or more from leaving the office, the key is pinpointing what specific expenses will change at retirement and adjusting one\\'s replacement rate accordingly. \"A household that is saving 20% of their pay, for example, in a 401(k) needs to replace a lower percentage of their final pay than one saving only 5% because they are used to living off less,\" Mr. Blanchett says.  Prof. Finke adds: \"Most of the wealthiest retirees don\\'t spend down their money at all. This means that if they didn\\'t want to give it to their kids they could have had a lot more fun when they were younger.\"  Mr. Powell is the editor of Retirement Weekly, a service of MarketWatch.com.

       " 'UpFront Health Care on a Budget The impact medical costs will have in retirement.  \"We talk about all aspects of what participants will need in retirement,\" says Michael Woomer, senior vice president of institutional and retirement plan services at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. \"People basically understand they will be facing health care costs, but they don\\'t understand how big the impact will be, so we tell participants how important it is to save as much as they can.\"  A recent report from the National Association of Government Defined Contribution (DC) Administrators estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring today should expect to spend $220,000 on health care over the course of a 20-year retirement. Woomer says the costs could range from $150,000 to $400,000.  It is far more important for plan advisers to discuss health care costs in retirement than it is to talk about lifestyle goals, says Mary McDougall, a Merrill Lynch financial adviser in St. Paul, Minnesota. The premiums and out-of-pocket expenses will range from $10,000 to $20,000 a year, she says. \"The expenses are a lot more than they expect.\"  \"I would hope that advisers are not refraining from having this conversation,\" says Scott Laue, a financial adviser with Savant Capital Management in Rockford, Illinois. \"As a certified financial planner [CFP], we are required to disclose both the good and the bad.\"  The trend toward high-deductible health care plans paired with health savings accounts (HSAs) is bringing the subject of health care costs-pre- and post-retirement-to the fore, says Shelby George, vice president, adviser services, at Manning & Napier in Rochester, New York. Just like the movement from pensions to defined contribution plans, employers are moving toward high-deductible plans, which put more of the onus on participants, and \"are encouraging advisers to talk about [those coming expenses] more in their education materials.\"  Advisers are also increasingly encouraging participants to invest in HSAs. \"This is one area that participants can use to save above and beyond the retirement plan,\" Woomer says.  Even for participants with more than $5 million in liquid assets-the market advised by Frank Migliazzo, managing director, private wealth advisers at Merrill Lynch in Troy, Michigan-health care costs are a concern. Migliazzo notes that Merrill Lynch research has found that, over the last 30 years, health care costs have risen an average of 6 percentage points above inflation each year.  Merrill Lynch has also found that many people will end up in a nursing home, he adds. For 65-year-olds, there is a 15% chance they will need to be placed in a care facility. At age 85, that possibility rises to 55%, and at age 90, it increases to 70%. Migliazzo\\'s clients are also worried about dementia. As a result, many are buying long-term-care insurance.  The report found that Medicare covers 62% of health care costs, but the individual is responsible for the remaining 38%.',\n",
       " \"Money I'm a first-time buyer confused by mortgage options I've been offered a few interest rates and wonder how fixing the rates would affect my mortgage  Q I'm currently looking for a mortgage to buy my first house and I'm very confused as there are so many options.  I have a few mortgage advisers offering me interest rates of between 4.8% and 5.2% for a five-year fixed rate. Are these good?  Is it better to fix it for shorter period and pay a lower interest rate? If I fix it for two years, will the interest rate go up? AP  A On the face of it, those interest rates seem pretty high especially given the fact that we've been enjoying several months of record low fixed interest rates.  Even if you got a mortgage of 90% of the value of a property, financial firm Moneyfacts says you could get a five-year fixed rate of 3.39% from Yorkshire Bank and a slightly higher 3.79% from Post Office Money. These are both a lot lower than the rates that you have been quoted.  However, if the figures of 4.8% and 5.2% that you have given are annual percentage rates (APR), they don't seem so bad. The APR gives you a way of comparing mortgage deals which takes into account all the costs of the mortgage including fees as well as the mortgage interest rate and the rate that the mortgage will revert to once the fixed rate is over. The APR for the Yorkshire Bank deal - which has an arrangement fee of £999 - is 4.5% while the APR on the Post Office Money offering - which has no fee - is 4.3%.  You are right in thinking that you'll be charged a lower rate of interest if you fix for a shorter amount of time. Again with a 90% mortgage, if you fixed for just two years, you would pay 2.39% with the Yorkshire Bank and 2.49% at the Loughborough building society.  The APRs are higher at 4.6% and 4.7% respectively, and if you only fix for two years you may have to pay a fee for a new deal afterwards, so the overall cost could be cheaper on a five-year deal.  Going for the shorter fix doesn't make it more likely that the interest rate will go up. Interest rates will go up or down whether you fix for two years or five. The question you need to ask yourself is whether you want the certainty of knowing that your mortgage payments won't change for five years or whether you are happy to take a gamble that interest rates generally won't have risen - as they are generally predicted to do - by too much in two years' time.

       " 'News What a nest egg! Mogul leaves 100G . . . to her cockatiels A late Manhattan entrepreneur who pioneered direct mailing with her \"rich list\" left $100,000 to her 32 cockatiels - with nitpicky instructions on how to care for the birds.  Leslie Ann Mandel, who was married to Arthur Herzog, author of the sci-fi thriller \"The Swarm,\" named her stepson, Matthew Herzog, as trustee of the pet fund.  Her will lovingly lists each of the birds - Wheetie, Port, Blackie, Zippy, Tara, Zara, Shasha, Pigeon, Victory, Alie, Zack 12, Dart, Cubby, Max, Baby, Ruthie, Pumpkin, Tattoo, Susie, Tracy, Margie, Sammy, Angel, Inky, Sara, Tundra, Tanteleah, Eva, Cody, Nicki, Avis and Dragon - and asks that the birds \"continue to live in the aviary\" in her $4 million East Hampton property.  As an alternative, they can be moved to \"a protected place of similar size and dimension, made of the same materials, without a cage, for the rest of their natural lives,\" the will says.  Mandel adds explicit instructions for their weekly maintenance.  \"It is my wish that the birds be fed and the building cleaned each Monday and Thursday and their food shall be purchased from Avi-Cakes, carrots, water and popcorn,\" the will states.  Avi-Cakes are a brand of natural birdfeed. A 20-pound bag costs $115.  Almost as an afterthought, Mandel says the cockatiels should share the $100,000 trust with her rescue dog, Frosty, and her cat, Kiki.  She provides no directions for their care and says the trustee can use his \"judgment and discretion\" on how to spend the money on them.  Mandel, who never had children of her own, died in June at age 69 after being admitted to the hospital with kidney stones.  She ran The Rich List Company, a fund-raising firm that, at one time, had the largest private mailing list in the country, according to her obituary in The East Hampton Star.  While Mandel meticulously planned for her pets\\' lives after her death, she wasn\\'t as careful about how the rest of her $5.3 million fortune would be spent.  A 2005 will left everything to Arthur Herzog, or to his son Matthew if Arthur died before her.  But Mandel crossed out Matthew\\'s name in 2006 and replaced it with her sister Avis Mandel\\'s.  When Mandel died Avis, 67, a Napa winery owner, submitted the marked-up will to Manhattan Surrogate\\'s Court claiming the original was \"obliterated.\"  Avis\\' attorney, John Morken, said that the notated will is not valid but that Avis and her other sister, Tracy, are entitled to the money anyway as her living relatives.  Matthew Herzog declined to comment.  The parties are due in court next month.  For the birds: Cockatiels - some of the 32 that belonged to the late Leslie Ann Mandel (below with cat Kiki) - perch in their special aviary at her East Hampton home on Friday. Mandel, who died in June, left a trust fund and detailed instructions for their continued care. [VictorAlcorn.com]',\n",

Prior to joining Sprott, Mr. Mitchell was chief investment officer for Sentry Investments, where he also managed the Sentry Global Growth and Income Fund/Class and Sentry Global Balanced Income Fund.  \"Dennis and I have known each other for a couple years and he was, in our view, an untouchable component of Sentry Investments,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"When he became available, it was much too great an opportunity for us to pass up.\"  Mr. Wilson said he hopes to have new products on Sprott\\'s shelf by the beginning of 2016.  The reason for Mr. Mitchell\\'s sudden departure from Sentry remains unknown.  \"Both sides have decided we are just going to move on and I have a ton of respect for the management at Sentry,\" Mr. Mitchell said.  \"After 10 years with them, I am proud of everything I have accomplished.\"  In his new role, Mr. Mitchell plans to continue his interaction with investors.  \"I envision I will be just as vocal with my message,\" Mr. Mitchell said in an interview. \"I enjoy spreading the gospel of what we are trying to do. I am extremely passionate about money management and when you are passionate about something this much, you certainly want to share it with people.\"  Mr. Mitchell is known for his expertise in managing global equity, infrastructure and REIT funds, all areas in which Sprott is looking to expand its offerings. Sprott has been transitioning its business model over the past several years, with a big focus on moving away from resource-focused funds.  \"The non-resource part of our business is now much larger than the resource part of our business,\" Mr. Wilson said. \"Specifically, we have heard a lot of requests from clients that they want to see more options in global opportunity.\"  Analysts see the hiring of Mr. Mitchell as a positive move for Sprott.  \"The hiring is on strategy. With Mr. Mitchell\\'s experience in managing global equity, infrastructure and REIT funds, we expect further product launches over the near term,\" wrote research analysts with Desjardins Capital Markets in a report released Tuesday. \"A well-regarded portfolio manager, Mr. Mitchell is also seen as a good fund marketer, which could benefit Sprott\\'s mutual fund sales.\"',\n",

In their first interview since the fund launched, the managers told Investment Week they cut the fund\\'s equity weighting from an initial 55% to 20%, in anticipation of worsening conditions in Asian and global markets.  Andrew Cole, senior investment manager, said: \"[Investors] need to make meaningful changes to their asset allocation to protect against the recent sell-off. Our long term average allocation to equities may be 60%, but sometimes we will want a good deal less.  \"We started reducing equities in June as we expected something to happen in China. The unpegging of the currency was a big signal for us.\"  Former Barings trio Percival Stanion, Cole, and Shaniel Ramjee joined Pictet last year to lead a push into the multi-asset space at a time when investors are struggling to navigate increasingly volatile markets.  The managers remain positive on Japanese and European stocks on a long-term view, but Cole said \"owning equities is what will hurt you in the summer, so get rid of them\".  Cash move  This decision, along with their zero allocation to emerging markets, has helped the trio mitigate losses, as global markets plummeted last week on growing concerns over slowing growth in China.  Instead, they moved into cash and long-dated gilts, which has helped performance, as has their allocation to unhedged Japanese equities as the yen strengthened.  \"Having a fairly concentrated portfolio can help focus on things that can do you damage,\" Cole said. \"Equities should offer higher returns, but that is because they are dangerous.\"  The new multi-asset fund has a minimum allocation of zero to all asset classes to allow the team maximum flexibility, and it does not employ leverage, financial engineering or long/short strategies. \"Risk models are unstable and inevitably blow up from time to time,\" the team said. \"That is why you need a qualitative approach.\"  China response  But Cole said the time to put high cash levels to work is \"on the horizon\", and the recent sell-off may even see the managers make their first foray into emerging markets for the new vehicle.  \"There may be an opportunity to buy some emerging markets and cyclical sectors, as they have had the biggest and most significant rerating,\" he said.  \"Some time before the end of September, we will see a buying opportunity. But whether we participate in that will depend on policy responses in China.\"  In particular the team is eyeing Brazil, which it said is on its radar if the currency stabilises.

       " 'PLANNING TO USE KIWISAVER IN RETIREMENT A quarter of people approaching retirement haven\\'t worked out what they will do with their KiwiSaver nest eggs.  Of those who do know, nearly six in 10 intend to leave some or all of the savings in their KiwiSaver accounts and withdraw money as and when they need it.  KiwiSaver is still relatively young, so the amounts saved are not yet life-changing, but it seems only 17 per cent plan to pull out all of their money when they reach 65.  The rest have either come to see KiwiSaver as a longer-term investment which they will keep after they reach 65 (57 per cent) or simply don\\'t know yet (26 per cent).  Next year, about a quarter of people over 65 will be continuing to work despite having started to receive NZ Super.  That\\'s expected to rise to nearly one in three by the mid- 2020s.  With wages still coming in and NZ Super on top, many older workers are able to leave their KiwiSaver untouched, and even contribute money to it, though their employers are no longer obligated to chip in with employer contributions.  KiwiSaver providers are beginning to promote KiwiSaver as a tool for managing money in retirement, allowing people to draw down on their balances slowly over time, thereby turning it into a regular income stream.  The survey was carried out by Colmar Brunton and paid for by the Commission for Financial Capability (CFFC) and the Financial Markets Authority (FMA), which released it to coincide with Money Week.  The two organisations have been researching how well older New Zealanders are preparing for retirement. They\\'ve found a mixed picture with some very well prepared, but many others unlikely to lead more than a most basic existence after they stop work, getting by on NZ Super and little else.  The survey found room for KiwiSaver providers to provide more advice.  Only 53 per cent of KiwiSavers felt the information offered by providers was useful for working out how big a lump sum they\\'d need to generate the income they would need in retirement.  Roughly the same proportion (49 per cent) felt it was helpful in making decisions about their retirement savings.  FMA spokeswoman Simone Robbers said the message from KiwiSaver members was that they wanted to get the right kind of information and resources, in a way that was easy to understand. \"We\\'ll continue to work with providers to ensure there is quality information available and it is more accessible.  \"It\\'s critical that people take some time to consider how best to preserve and use their hard- earned lump sum when they reach 65.\"  David Boyle, the CFFC\\'s manager of investor education, said: \"It is pleasing to see half those members who have access to their funds today view KiwiSaver as an investment option not just for saving for retirement, but to generate some additional growth and income during the years they are in retirement.\"',\n",

Employees at the investment and retirement specialist gave Cllr Anne Court a warm welcome as she toured the office in Winterthur Way.  Back in 2010 the company was known as AXA Winterthur Wealth Management.  The Winterthur Way office became the head office of AXA Wealth after AXA Group sold its UK life business to investment firm Resolution, but kept its wealth management business.  During the celebration visit Cllr Court congratulated AXA Wealth on developing the culture within the business that helped the Sunday Times recognise AXA as one of the best big companies to work for in the UK, earlier this year, placing the company in 19 th position - up three places on last year.  The judging criteria for the accolade, based on employee feedback, included support for local communities, the range of products and support on offer and the benefits provided to employees.  AXA scored well across the board and prides itself on giving employees access to the things that mean a lot to them and make a difference to their work and home life, such as childcare vouchers, holiday purchase and discounted gym membership.  Cllr Court spoke with some of the 400 employees based at the offcie, about their achievements, such as representing AXA Wealth in a variety of sporting events at the UK Corporate Games, the support they have for professional development, fundraising for local charities and being part of AXA\\'s Graduate Programme.  \"It was a pleasure to visit AXA Wealth recently and have the opportunity to meet with so many of its employees,\" said Cllr Court.  \"One thing that came across was that they enjoy working there and really appreciate all of the opportunities they\\'re given, not only in their work, but also getting involved to make such a big difference to our local community. \"Congratulations to all of them for raising so much money for our local charities, they should all be proud.\"  Chief executive officer Mike Kellard said: \"It\\'s our employees that make AXA Wealth such a great place to work and it\\'s about so much more than just a job.  \"It\\'s having a diverse workforce, flexible working, making it easier for people to work and play.  \"For example we have a sports and social club run by employees who arrange social events and onsite workout classes.  \"And it doesn\\'t stop there.

       " 'Globe Investor \\'Maximum pessimism\\' for the loonie? Not quite sbarlow@globeandmail.com  Inside the Market  Where the loonie is concerned, global futures markets have reached what has marked, in other times, \"the point of maximum pessimism\" - a phrase coined by Sir John Templeton describing the perfect time to buy an asset.  The big question for Canadians is whether the economic backdrop has deteriorated far enough that maximum pessimism, as measured by hedge fund positioning, is actually far lower than current levels.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) issues a weekly report detailing futures positioning in a wide variety of asset classes including currencies, commodities and bonds.  The \"non-commercial\" section of the report is widely used as a proxy for speculative, hedge fund futures positioning.  The top chart shows the net hedge fund positioning - simply the number of long, bullish futures contracts minus the number of bearish futures positions - on the Canadian dollar, compared with the value of the loonie in U.S. dollar terms.  Hedge funds are now net short by 66,000 contracts on the Canadian dollar as of Friday\\'s CFTC report. This is very close to the peaks of speculative pessimism reached in April, 2013 and January, 2014.  It is tempting to call the extent of negative sentiment on the loonie \"excessive\" and a sign of a market bottom and subsequent rally.  In the near term, the oil price will determine whether this is the case or not.  The domestic currency has closely tracked the West Texas intermediate crude price in the past five years and the profound weakness in the oil market is putting significant downward pressure on the loonie.  It is likely that the Canadian dollar will remain weak until the crude price recovers. The lower chart shows that the previous two periods of severe hedge fund bearishness - April, 2013, and January, 2014 - also marked a temporary bottom on the oil price (although at prices far higher than today).  Short positions on the loonie are likely to continue to pile on, driving the currency lower, until the oil price recovers.  In the next few weeks, refineries will be shutting down for maintenance and retooling, and this will almost definitely cause a sharp drop in immediate oil demand. The crude price, and by extension the Canadian dollar, are unlikely to recover until this process runs its course.  Citigroup analyst Seth Kleinman was in the news Wednesday predicting that a return to the $32.40-(U.S.)-per-barrel low during the financial crisis is a \"conceivable reality.\"  Finance author and columnist Gary Shilling is predicting an oil price between $10 and $20 per barrel.  These are just two guesses among many, but they do provide an indication of the extent of downward momentum for the oil price.  The good news is that the refinery-led shortage in oil demand is temporary and will only last a few weeks. Before it ends, however, Canadians should be very careful about calling a bottom in the Canadian dollar.',\n",
       " \"Globe Investor Banks that can benefit from higher rates Number Cruncher  What are we looking for?  Solid U.S. July jobs numbers were released last Friday, signalling that a central bank rate hike in September is becoming a likely scenario. Rising rates are a positive indicator for financial companies that earn revenue based on the difference of the interest income generated from loans to their cost on borrowed funds, called net interest margin (NIM). I am looking for U.S. banks that could benefit from a hike in interest rates.  The screen  I looked for U.S. financial companies with a market capitalization of at least $2-billion (U.S.), a positive NIM and a price-toearnings ratio of less than 20.  As a requirement for financial institutions after the financial crisis, the Tier 1 capital ratio is used as a core measure of a bank's financial strength. It is calculated by the ratio of a bank's core equity capital to its total risk-weighted assets. The minimum requirement by law is 6 per cent; for our screen, I required a ratio of at least 12 per cent.  As a measure of relative valuation, I filtered for banks that had a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of less than 1.6. The P/B ratio compares the market value of a company's stock with the total value of the assets carried on its balance sheet. A ratio less than 2 can mean that a company is relatively undervalued. To gauge how well banks manage their overhead costs as a percentage of total revenues, analysts use the bank efficiency ratio, favouring a lower number.  For our screen, I looked for companies of less than 60 per cent.

       " \"How to: Money A retirement plan adviser can benefit your company Attempting to run a company retirement plan without adequate resources can cost both the company and employees money.  Hiring an adviser gives you the potential to lower plan costs, offer better investment choices, educate your employees and improve your participation rate and deferral amount.  A retirement plan adviser can help guide you in many key areas, including the following:  Assessing your needs  All retirement plans have the same ultimate objective: helping employees save for retirement.  However, what's right for one company might not be right for another. An adviser can help you sort through these choices and select the plan that's best for your company.  Determine optimal plan design  Your adviser might be able to work with you to redesign portions of an existing plan to best meet your employees' needs.  Balancing these provisions so that they provide the maximum benefit to both the company and its employees can be invaluable to a plan's success.  Choose and manage plan investments  Depending on the adviser and your company's needs, you have several options for investment management.  A retirement plan adviser can provide you with sound financial advice on investment management, which is an expectation set by your fiduciary responsibility to the plan.  Some advisers can offer fiduciary protection to your plan.  You should understand the level of their commitment and receive this in writing.  Provide education for plan participants  A valuable part of any retirement plan is participant education.  Your adviser can help you with this by scheduling enrollment meetings, providing plan materials, setting up ongoing investment education courses and serving as an educational contact for plan participants.  Having a strong education program can increase participation rates, deferral rates and help your employees understand their investment choices.  Provide guidance on fee/expense structures  Your adviser should be able to help you identify and assess any fees paid by you or your participants.  They can evaluate if fees seem reasonable for the services provided. Because some of these fees usually are passed on to employees through the plan, keeping them as low as possible can help your employees save as much as possible for retirement.  Provide liability support as a co-fiduciary  Perhaps the most important aspect of hiring an adviser for your retirement plan is to minimize your fiduciary responsibility.  ERISA (the Employee Retirement Income Security Act) is a federal law that sets standards for most retirement plans in the private industry. These standards protect employees but can saddle employers with overwhelming fiduciary responsibilities. Qualified advisers can relieve you of some of this responsibility.

The main European markets enjoyed a strong session with Germany\\'s Dax and France\\'s Cac 40 both ahead by more than 1.5 per cent. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was in positive territory after a well-received round of corporate earnings figures.  Gains in London\\'s top tier came despite figures suggesting growth in the UK\\'s powerhouse services sector cooled last month in the latest sign that economic expansion has eased since a robust second quarter.  The closely-watched CIPS/Markit purchasing managers\\' index (PMI) survey showed a lower-than-expected reading of 57.4 in July.  But sterling held its own after data revisions by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the UK economy grew more strongly than previously thought from 2011 to 2013, with further revisions for the period to date due later this year. The pound was ahead against the US dollar at just under 1.56 and against the euro at a little above 1.43.  In shares, Legal & General added some encouragement from a life and pensions sector left reeling by legislation in April allowing pensioners to retire without having to buy an annuity.  The group\\'s profits rose as it looked to other revenue streams, boosting its workplace auto-enrolment business under which employees are automatically signed up to retirement schemes at work. Shares added 7.3p to 270.7p, Direct Line Insurance also lifted, up 8.8p to 384.6p.  Royal Bank of Scotland was another strong performer in the top-flight, rising two per cent, or 7.7p to 346.7p, prompting further criticism that the taxpayer was short-changed after making a £1bn loss on the Government\\'s sale of a 5.4 per cent stake in the lender.  Brokers at Numis said the sale at 330p a share \"achieved a new 2015 low and arguably sold the tax-payer short\".  Asia-focused bank Standard Chartered was also in focus as half-year results showed pre-tax profits down 44 per cent to $1.8bn (£1.2bn) and the group\\'s interim dividend halved. Shares rose 2.1p to 954.7p as new chief executive Bill Winters promised cost cuts.',\n",
       " 'Pensions Volatility hits Standard Life Investments\\' GARS in Q2 Standard Life Investments\\' Global Absolute Return Strategies fund has suffered its first quarterly loss since mid-2013 in the three months to 30 June after it was caught up in the market volatility seen in the second quarter.  According to FE Trustnet, the £25bn SLI GARS fund lost 1.5% during Q2. The FTSE All Share fell 2% over the period, and the MSCI World dropped 5.4% in sterling terms.  The drop is the first time the fund has made a quarterly loss since Q2 2013, when the portfolio dipped 0.9% as a result of the \\'taper tantrum\\' sparked by the US Federal Reserve.  \"This is the first negative quarter we have had in quite a while. It was a very mixed quarter for us. Falls have not come from any one general area; there has been a lot of movement in the portfolio,\" SLI multi-asset head Guy Stern (pictured) told clients last week.  \"During the quarter we had 33 different strategies at work in the portfolio. Unfortunately, only five of those strategies went up, while 13 went down. That is an indication we did not have any individual strategy that grossly dominated the portfolio.\"  The fund remains 6.8% higher on a one-year view.  \"We are still very clearly on track for reaching our return targets for the year,\" Stern added.  Particular negative contributors included a German versus French equity relative value trade, which lost 0.3% and has now been exited; a US large cap versus US small cap equities trade, which lost 0.3%; and a European equity position, which lost 0.2%.  The fund\\'s top trade over the quarter was a short US duration position. The trade contributed 0.7% over the period, as bond yields began to rise in anticipation of the Federal Reserve hiking rates.  The fund is now more \"pointed\" in its equity exposure, according to Stern, having closed a US equity beta position and running long positions in high beta European and Japanese markets and mining stocks.  Stern said the position in global miner equities had been \"a very negative\" contributor to the fund in the quarter, due to falls in commodity prices such as copper and iron ore.  However, he added the trade, combined with a position in Australian short-term interest rates, had \"paid off nicely\" since it was first put in place.  Among the new positions initiated in the quarter was a relative value trade in sterling versus the Swiss franc.  \"There is no fundamental reason economically or on a valuation basis to have the Swiss franc at the levels it is at? we can see devaluation there,\" Stern said.  The team continues to position the fund this year according to four themes: multi-speed global growth; central bank policy; resources and demand; and growth potential and uncertainty.

       " 'Business Day; Economy Home Sales Jump in June as Demand Exceeds Supply WASHINGTON - Americans bought homes in June at the fastest rate in over eight years, pushing prices higher as buyer demand eclipsed the availability of houses on the market.  The National Association of Realtors said Wednesday that sales of existing homes rose 3.2 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.49 million, the highest rate since February 2007. Sales have increased 9.6 percent over the last 12 months, while the number of listings has risen just 0.4 percent.  Median home prices climbed 6.5 percent over the last 12 months to $236,400, the highest level reported by the association, not adjusted for inflation.  Home buying has recently surged as more buyers have entered the market. Robust hiring over the last 21 months and an economic recovery now in its sixth year have enabled more Americans to set aside money for down payments. But the rising demand has failed to draw more sellers into the market, causing tight inventories and escalating prices that could cap sales growth.  \"The recent pace can\\'t be sustained, but it points clearly to upside potential,\" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.  A mere five months\\' supply of homes was on the market in June, compared with 5.5 months a year ago and an average of six months in a healthy market.  Some markets are barely adding listings. The condominium market in Massachusetts contains just 1.8 months\\' supply, according to a Federal Reserve report this month. The majority of real estate agents in the Atlanta Fed region, which ranges from Alabama to Florida, said that inventories were flat or fell over the last year.  Some of the recent increase in sales appears to have come from the prospect of mortgage rates beginning to rise as the Federal Reserve considers raising an important interest rate from its near-zero level this year. That possibility is prompting buyers to complete sales before higher rates make borrowing more expensive, noted Daren Blomquist, a vice president at RealtyTrac, a housing analytics firm.  The premiums that the Federal Housing Administration charges to insure mortgages are also lower this year, further propelling buying activity, Mr. Blomquist said.  Properties typically sold last month in 34 days, the shortest time since the Realtors began tracking the figure in May 2011. There were fewer all-cash, individual investor and distressed home sales in the market, as more traditional buyers have returned.  Sales improved in all four geographical regions: Northeast, Midwest, South and West.  Still, the limited supplies could eventually prove to be a drag on sales growth in the coming months.  Low mortgage rates have also helped, although rates are starting to climb to levels that could slow buying activity.  Average 30-year fixed rates were 4.09 percent last week, according to the mortgage company Freddie Mac. The average has risen from a 52-week low of 3.59 percent.',\n",
       " 'Just one in three retirees will get full state pension payouts after reforms next year BARELY one in three retirees are to set to receive the new flat-rate state pension when it comes into effect next year, according to Government estimates.  GETTY  Only one in three people will get the full state pension next year  Anyone who has paid at least 35 years of National Insurance contributions were promised they would get the full pension payout of £148 a week when benefit reforms take effect in April 2016.  Yet, it\\'s now been revealed that only 222,000 out of the 600,000 people who will hit retirement age in the 12 months after the changes will qualify for the maximum payout.  Just 37 per cent will be able to claim the full amount, a dramatic drop on the number originally forecast, according to Department for Work and Pensions figures.  Around 100,000 fewer retirees than originally expected will qualify for the full payout in the first ten years of the new benefit, as a result of a trick in missed contributions.  Workers who spent any time \\'contracted out\\' are most likely to be affected, after opting out of receiving state second benefits in exchange for paying a reduced rate of National Insurance.  Because of the lower contributions these workers could now lose some of their new state pension.  Related articles Standard Life \\'with profits\\' policies: Are you one of 65,000... How to prepare your money for an interest rate rise  Initially it was thought that someone who had contracted out for a brief period of time but still had 35 years of full-rate contributions could still claim the full amount.  However, even these people could face a reduced state pension because the Government said they could have used lower payments to make provisions for their retirement elsewhere, such as a private pension.  Many retirees are set to be bitterly disappointed after the Government touted the reforms as a more generous and simpler pension system.  Even by the third year of the new state pension in April 2018, just 46 per cent of people will qualify for the full payout.  Only by 2020 is the figure predicted to reach 50 per cent, to reach 84 per cent in 2035.  A DWP spokesman said: \"People who spent time contracted-out either paid NI contributions at a lower rate, or some of the NI contributions they paid were used to contribute to a private pension, which they will also benefit from when they retire.  \"The new State Pension will be easier to understand than the current system, and we are planning a media campaign to explain the changes that are about to come into effect.\"  Related articles Rare 2p sells for staggering £800 - and here\\'s how to spot a valuable coin in your change The big name banks losing the most customers Britons MORE likely to vote for EU exit after Greek deal leaves lefties in shock over cuts',\n",
       " 'S3 Call to revise wills after Inheritance Tax threshold is raised WEALTHY homeowners have been advised to review their will after the amount that they can leave tax-free to direct descendants was increased in the Budget.  Chancellor George Osborne pledged to raise the Inheritance Tax (IHT) threshold from £325,000 per person to £500,000 from April 2020.  This means a married couple or civil partners can leave assets, including property, to their family free of inheritance tax up to the value of £1m.  For example, if you own a property worth up to £350,000 and have remaining assets of £650,000 you could pass it on tax free.  Similarly, a couple who owned a home worth £750,000 and had other assets of £250,000 would not trigger a charge.  The additional property allowance will start at £100,000 in 2017/2018 and will rise to £175,000 by 2020/2021.  The result is that by the 2020/2021 tax year, each individual could have an inheritance tax allowance of £500,000.  Rob Fearnley, left, a partner specialising in tax planning at Festival Park law firm Bowcock & Pursaill said: \"The announcement is important for any clients with a will or anyone looking into succession planning.  \"It means that married couples and civil partners will be able to pass on assets worth up to £1 million, including a family home, without paying any IHT at all.  \"Under the previous rules IHT was levied at a rate of 40 per cent on the value of an estate above the tax-free threshold of £325,000 per individual or £650,000 per couple.  \"For any homeowners this will be welcome news as this new announcement can reduce tax in their estates passing to children or grandchildren after their death.\"  The family home allowance is only available when a main residence is passed to direct descendants such as children or grandchildren.  But if someone downsizes or no longer owns a home since the Budget on July 8 they will be able to pass assets of the equivalent value up to the £175,000 to their direct descendants on death.  He added: \"Obviously you will have to look at your will as this announcement may potentially mean you now want to alter your will to take full advantage of the new allowance.  \"The news will be very welcome to pensioners who have invested in their homes, allowing them to more effectively plan their estates for what for many is their most valuable, or only real, asset.  \"The bad news is it doesn\\'t all come in one go as it is staggered and if your estate is worth over two million you start to lose some of the new allowance.  \"Obviously it\\'s not in legislation yet so there may be more details to come.  \"At that stage we would advise our clients to give us a call and talk it over so they can be sure their current arrangements are effective in IHT mitigation.\"',\n",

Murphy will be Menlo\\'s seventh managing director and will look for investments in mobile applications and enterprise infrastructure. Of those partners, Murphy notes that two are planning to transition toward retirement after the current $400 million fund and a third is running a portfolio company, so Menlo will have a relatively small core group of decision makers that can communicate quickly on potential deals.  Murphy\\'s known Menlo partners like Mark Siegel and Venky Ganesan for years and had worked with the the firm in the past. \"I was pretty open about looking for something smaller, and it\\'s a tight-knit team of the same generation,\" Murphy says. \"I think they\\'re known for being a standup firm of high quality individuals who do the right thing. They were always on my first handful of calls if I was looking at something.\"  In moving Kleiner Perkins, Murphy leaves a firm with several dozen investors and multiple funds totaling more than $1 billion. Menlo\\'s size is large enough to maintain investments in companies up until the growth stage, but skews it more towards very early stage investments.  Murphy was recently seen under oath at the Ellen Pao gender discrimination case against Kleiner Perkins, which Pao lost but may appeal. Murphy had testified he recommended firing Pao and also mentioned his imminent departure on the stand. Moving on from the case, he says, is not a motivation for moving. \"My decision to leave was made well before the trial,\" Murphy says, echoing what he told press at the time of that testimony. \"I think Kleiner is doing phenomenally well from a return standpoint, and I think they\\'re moving past it in a really positive way. It\\'s a terrific firm and terrific culture.\"  Kleiner Perkins partner Ted Schlein, for his part, called Murphy\\'s performance exemplary while at the firm he joined in 1999. More tellingly, Murphy will continue to represent Kleiner Perkins on six boards of directors even as he invests from Menlo. \"That means I\\'ll be working closely with them for a long time,\" Murphy says. \"it\\'s a special relationship.\"  Four companies in Murphy\\'s portfolio joined the billion-dollar startup club in the past year: AppDynamics, Insidesales.com, Shazam and Simplivity.

       " 'Investor News Jacobsen Craft Brewery Celebrates its 10th Birthday Ceremonial barrel to be opened at Copenhagen Beer Festival  Copenhagen, 2015-05-28 11:01 CEST (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At exactly 20:05 Copenhagen time today, Morten Ibsen, Jacobsen Brewmaster, will uncork a 100-litre wooden barrel of Jacobsen Original Dark Lager. The time (20:05) is a reminder of the year the Jacobsen brewery was inaugurated, 10 years ago, in 2005.  The brewery began its life as an ode to Carlsberg founder J.C. Jacobsen, established with the mission of creating craft beers of uncompromising quality, using brand new, state-of-the-art brewing facilities, the finest natural ingredients, and 150-plus years of Carlsberg innovation and know-how. The Jacobsen brewery has access to all Carlsberg\\'s expertise as well as resources from Carlsberg research facilities, but is a completely independent brewery with the remit of creating and producing the best and most exciting specialty brews in the world.  Since then Jacobsen has produced a range of highly successful, award-winning craft beer varieties. They can, of course be enjoyed in their own right, but one of Jacobsen\\'s goals has always been to bring beer back to the dining room table, as the perfect complement to an array of different foods. \"We want to give people new taste experiences and we want to challenge and develop beer culture,\" says Jacobsen brewmaster Morten Ibsen. \"It\\'s about making the most of what nature has to offer.\"  One of Jacobsen\\'s first creations was Saaz Blonde, a light-coloured beer brewed using Belgian traditions, Czech Saaz hops, along with angelica extracts for a rounded, slightly sweet blonde ale that pairs perfectly with fare like yellow cheeses and lamb. Another example is Jacobsen Extra Pilsner, which received a maximum, three-star rating from the International Taste & Quality Institute in Belgium. It is a luxury pilsner that\\'s crafted using ingredients from the Nordic region: Danish malt, and organic hops from Germany.  Today, the Jacobsen Brewhouse has seven different craft brews in its day-to-day repertoire, seasonal variants as well as its renowned Vintage no.1, Vintage no.2, Vintage no. 3 and Jacobsen Limited Edition beers. Jacobsen products are currently available across Denmark, and some beers are exported to Sweden, Norway, the UK and Israel. The brewery now runs at close to full capacity and options for expansion are being evaluated.  Looking back over the first ten years of Jacobsen, Morten Ibsen concludes: \"Every bottle of Jacobsen beer bears the words \"Unlimited Dedication\", and this really sums up what we do here. We\\'ve been at the forefront of the Danish craft beer movement for ten years now, and the huge popularity of our beers here in Denmark and abroad just goes to show that dedication and uncompromising quality is a recipe for success.\"           Media Relations:\\tJens Bekke\\t+45 3327 1412\\tJim Daniell \\t+45 3327 2874          Investor Relations:\\tPeter Kondrup\\t+45 3327 1221\\tIben Steiness\\t+45 3327   1232   news4167976849531260811.xml',\n",
       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING Buybacks and dividends set to top $1tn; Equities Share repurchase activity supports US companies amid investor activism  US companies are bolstering their earnings as the share buyback boom shows little sign of ending.  The proliferation of share repurchase activity has been an important source of support for US equities that loiter in sight of record territory.  US companies are sitting on huge cash piles and the subsequent lacklustre economic recovery has made them reluctant to spend on expanding operations. In turn, they have directed money to buybacks and dividends with pressure from activist shareholders advancing the trend. But critics have emerged to question whether focusing on shareholder return rather than new development may represent a drag on the economy.  Analysts forecast buybacks and dividends will top $1tn for 2015. The scale of repurchases is bolstering earnings: one in five S&P 500 companies has raised earnings by at least 4 per cent for each of the past five quarters according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&PDow Jones Indices.  Share buybacks offset options granted to employees, but companies in recent years have also bought back more than they need to protect earnings. While repurchases can boost earnings per share, they do not represent an increase in the profitability of the business - the same essential level of profits is just split among fewer shares.  For the first quarter, cash returned to shareholders - consisting of repurchases and dividends - is shaping up as a record $241.7bn, according to S&PDow Jones Indices, eclipsing the previous high of $233.2bn achieved during the second quarter of 2007.  Dividends set a new record at $93.6bn, while companies, led by Apple , have reported buybacks around $148bn, up from the previous quarter, but still shy of the record $172bn recorded for the third quarter of 2007.  Years of low interest rates have played a key role in the surge of both dividends and buybacks.  \"Companies have not re-leveraged their balance sheets despite the low cost of corporate debt and record high cash balances,\" said Jonathan Golub, chief US market strategist at RBC Capital Markets. \"As a result, companies have a huge opportunity to increase earnings per share further should they choose to tap into this capital cushion. With growth likely to remain hard to come by, we believe this is the likely path forward.\"  Much of the money for dividends and buybacks has come from cash reserves bloated by fatter profit margins thanks to cost-cutting, but many companies have turned to bond markets to raise money cheaply for equity investors.  During April Amgen sold bonds earmarked to fund buybacks, while Oracle said in a regulatory filing that the use of proceeds from a bond sale might include stock repurchases and paying dividends.  \"We will soon be getting away from our addiction to low interest rates, but the addition to buybacks still appears to be growing,\" said Mr Silverblatt.',\n",

The ten tips encompass death benefits, tax, investment solutions, due diligence, policies and controls:  * Find out if you have clients that could miss out - review legacy pensions to understand which contracts can support new flexibilities on death  * Prepare to transfer pensions that do not support death benefits as soon as possible and consider aggregating pension assets with other client assets  * Review all pension bypass trust arrangements and death benefit nominations to ensure they are up-to-date  * Review ISAs to establish whether the client would benefit from transferring to a pension to access tax relief  * Develop a tax optimisation policy for assets being invested pre-retirement; outlining which wrappers should be prioritised and why  * Enhance your CIP to meet the needs of clients in retirement - reflect the difference between short, medium and long term monies and protect your clients from the devastating long term impact of a short term market fall in the early years of retirement  * Develop an income optimisation policy for withdrawals; document the order of wrappers and investment portfolios used to support withdrawals to minimise tax and investment risk  * Agree a clear withdrawal policy with your clients documenting the sustainable asset harvesting approach you have agreed\",\n",

       " \"Does A Person With A Medical Condition Affecting His Mind Have The Mental Capacity To Make A Will? One of the grounds for challenging the validity of a Will is that the person who made the Will did not have the mental capacity to understand his actions.\\xa0 With an aging population and higher rates of medical conditions, such as Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease, which may affect a person's memory and other mental functions, questions about testamentary capacity arise more frequently.  In a recent case Bull Estate v. Bull, the Supreme Court of BC provided further guidance on the issue of testamentary capacity. In Bull Estate, the deceased made a Will in 2010 leaving more assets to her daughter than her son. The deceased died in September 2012. Her son challenged the Will on the basis that, amongst other things, the deceased's progressive dementia made her incapable of making the Will.  The Court found that the deceased had the requisite testamentary capacity when she executed the Will in 2010, and the Court further stated that sufficient mental capacity to make a Will may exist despite the presence of cognitive deterioration, and a will-maker may have sufficient mental capacity even if his/her ability to manage other aspects of his/her affairs is impaired.  In reaching its conclusion, the Court summarized the following non-exhaustive principles that have been established by courts over the years:  the test for testamentary capacity is not overly onerous;  simply having an imperfect or impaired memory does not in of itself absent testamentary capacity unless it is so great as to leave no disposing memory;  the will-maker needs to have an appreciation of the claims of the persons who are natural objects of his/her estate and the extent of his/her property of which he/she is disposing;  because testamentary capacity is a legal question and not a medical question, a medical opinion, although valuable and relevant, is not determinative of testamentary capacity;  a will-maker cannot be found not to have testamentary capacity simply because he/she chose to leave his/her estate in a manner that some might think unkind.  While each case of testamentary capacity turns on its own unique facts and evidence presented, the Bull Estate decision sets a high bar for a person challenging a Will to establish that the will-maker did not have the requisite mental capacity to make the Will, even if the will-maker suffered from medical conditions affecting his or her mental functions when the Will was made.

       " 'Opinion Workers welcome win on 401(k) fees If you\\'re among the 50 million Americans with a 401(k) retirement account, you probably have no idea how much in fees your friendly mutual fund is taking out of your nest egg. The quarterly statements you get list the \"expense ratio,\" but it takes serious math skills to figure out exactly how much that totals.  So it\\'s a relief that in its first ruling on 401(k) fees, the U.S. Supreme Court sided Monday with employees and retirees. Justices unanimously put the onus on employers to continually monitor the 401(k) plans they provide to make sure participants aren\\'t being gouged with unnecessarily high fees.  Just like compounded interest, a relatively small difference in fees can add up. For instance, a 1 percent fee - instead of a far more reasonable 0.25 percent - would rob $30,000 from a $100,000 account earning a 4 percent annual return over 20 years. That\\'s not chump change.  Consumer advocates say the decision will pressure companies to be more careful with their employees\\' money and to offer a wider choice of lower-cost mutual funds. Advocates also hope the ruling pushes mutual funds to lower fees and be more transparent because they will have to be more competitive.  While some higher-fee funds that are more actively managed can provide higher returns, in general, fees of more than 2 percent are considered excessive. Fees for popular index funds are lower.  Except for public employees, 401(k) accounts have replaced traditional pensions as a main source of retirement income. With more than 500,000 plans holding about $4.5 trillion - nearly one fifth of all U.S. retirement assets - it\\'s only proper that they draw more scrutiny from regulators and from the courts.  This Supreme Court has not exactly been friendly to workers, so this sweeping ruling should be a loud warning to Wall Street and to big corporations about what\\'s an acceptable way to do business.  The case involved Edison International, the parent of the mammoth utility in Southern California. In a 2007 class action lawsuit brought on behalf of 20,000 employees and retirees, lawyers claimed that that Edison violated its fiduciary duty by choosing more expensive 401(k) plans when virtually identical, but lower-cost, ones were available. More than a dozen corporations, including household names such as Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Co., have been hit with similar lawsuits.  In the ruling, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that companies and trustees in charge of 401(k) plans have an ongoing duty to monitor investments and to \"remove imprudent ones.\" Before this ruling, companies only had that responsibility for six years after the investment funds were first picked.  If employees and retirees have to make more important investment decisions on their own, it\\'s only fair that their employers actually give them a choice of reputable funds that offer a decent return.

       " \"The Accumulator: Simon Lake of Sound Financial Management Simon Lake of Sound Financial Management uses low-cost model portfolios mainly held in Sipps to meet clients' retirement needs.  THE PROPOSITION Simon Lake, chartered financial planner, Sound Financial Management  Helping our clients save for their retirement is one of our greatest responsibilities. Our clients rely on us to make sure their money is in the right place at the right time throughout their life, leading up to their sunset years. As life expectancies lengthen, a client's retirement could last as long as half their career.  Clients' goal is often to accumulate as much money as possible along with paying down liabilities, such as mortgages. Our job is to make sure our clients stay focused on their strategy, making any necessary adjustments when necessary, especially as risk appetite decreases with age.  All accumulation strategies rely on long-term positive investment growth. We add value by ensuring our clients benefit from making the best use of the tax system, using the reliefs and allowances available.  Money overspent on expensive products and investment funds is often money wasted, so we recommend value-for-money financial solutions for our clients. A modern wrap pension solution, for example, can offer clients good accumulation and decumulation options, and using the right vehicle can add value.  THE FIGURES  What's in your wrapper? The contents of the wrapper depend on the client's goals. A business owner may wish to hold their business premises in a SSAS but many simply rely on our investment expertise for their money.  We run in-house, low-cost, model portfolios for most of our clients and often select several well-researched satellite investment ideas to add further alpha, if appropriate.  These models are reviewed by our investment committee every six months. We also run workplace pension schemes a default investment strategy can add value over the long term.  Retirement planning tips Keep up-to-date with all legislative changes especially in the pensions world.  Maintain your relationships with your clients and their families throughout their careers.  Regularly assess risk appetite and challenge perceptions whenever necessary.  Reassure your clients that you and your family are in the same boat as them.  Your clients rely on your advice and guidance, not the internet.  My favourite client case I helped a client trace a long-lost pension from an old occupational scheme membership and the results radically improved her outlook on retirement. She is now looking forward to leaving work five years earlier than planned.  Her private pension arrangements are also now set up to allow her complete freedom with her income needs under the new legislation.  Decumulation corner After retirement, although our clients have more time on their hands, they continue to rely on us for up-to-date financial planning and tax advice.  Investments need to yield income and capital, so adjustments have to be made to accumulation plans. We may also need to look further ahead, for example to consider care fees or inheritance tax.\",\n",
       " 'A-Section High court sides with workers in 401(k) suit The U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling Monday that could make it easier for 401(k) plan participants to sue employers for offering investment options that erode their retirement savings through excessive fees.  The court\\'s unanimous ruling involved claims by participants in the retirement plan run by the California-based energy company Edison International. The employees argued that the company offered six mutual funds with higher fees than identical institutional funds that were available but not offered to participants in Edison\\'s retirement plan. By neglecting to offer the lower-cost investment options, the company did not act in workers\\' and retirees\\' best interests, as required by law, plan participants argued.  \"This is a victory for workers and retirees in 401(k) plans because it makes very clear that there is an ongoing duty on the part of fiduciaries to make sure fees are reasonable and investments are prudent,\" said Jerome J. Schlichter, a St. Louis lawyer who has brought a series of suits challenging the fees attached to workers\\' 401(k) plans.  Even a modest jump in fees can have a significant impact on the amount of money workers can accrue in their retirement accounts during the course of their careers. The Labor Department said that a one-percentage-point change in fees could result in a 28 percent difference in retirement savings for a worker who kept $25,000 in an account earning an average of 7 percent in investment returns annually over 35 years.  The high court\\'s ruling revived a claim by Edison employees that previously had been dismissed by a federal appeals court. The court had ruled that the employees did not act quickly enough to challenge the investment options offered in Edison\\'s retirement plan. But the Supreme Court disagreed with that finding, saying that employers have a continuing responsibility to monitor fees.  \"The continuing duty to review investments includes a duty to remove imprudent investments,\" Justice Stephen G. Breyer, the author of the court\\'s opinion, said in announcing the decision.  The settlement was the latest in a series of cases that are reshaping the options that companies offer employees for investing the trillions of dollars held in 401(k) retirement accounts. Earlier this year, a federal judge gave preliminary approval to a settlement with participants in Lockheed Martin\\'s 401(k) plan who sued the defense contractor for allowing excessive fees in their retirement plans.  The Supreme Court\\'s ruling came as consumer advocates and the Obama administration have brought the previously obscure issue of the cost of investment fees under greater scrutiny. Earlier this year, President Obama endorsed a new regulation that would increase the standards for brokers who recommend investments for retirement accounts.  The Edison case will return to lower courts for further litigation on the scope of the company\\'s duty to monitor investment options.  The case is Tibble v. Edison International.  http://www.washingtonpost.com  WP20150519401k0519',\n",
       " 'News Prepaid College Card Standards Elevated Credit unions that issue debit and prepaid cards to college students receiving financial aid could soon find themselves answering to new rules from the Department of Education, the agency announced .  Under regulations made available for public comment on Friday, higher-education institutions would not be allowed to require students to deposit their financial aid dollars in accounts with specific financial institutions. The rules would also prohibit charging overdraft fees if students select accounts offered directly or indirectly by contractors that help schools disburse federal student aid. \"Reasonable access\" to surcharge-free ATMs and fee-free access to financial aid funds for a 30-day period would also be required.  The rule would establish two types of arrangements between schools and financial institutions: T1 arrangements, which are agreements to process federal aid on behalf of the school, and T2 arrangements, which involve agreements to market those accounts directly to students and their parents.  Higher-education institutions will also have to give students a list of account options for receiving their financial aid funds under the proposed rules, and the list options must be \"presented in a neutral manner,\" according to the announcement. The student\\'s preexisting bank account must appear first on the list, the Department of Education said.  Schools will not be allowed to share personal information about students or their parents with a financial institution unless the student or parents already have an account with the financial institution, the proposed rules said. School contracts with financial institutions governing the arrangements would be public record as well .  Finally, the proposed rules require higher-education institutions to ensure electronic payments to a students\\' preexisting account are made just as quickly as they would be to accounts marketed through the school.  \"Through these proposed protections, the Education Department seeks to protect students from unreasonable account fees, safeguard taxpayer dollars, provide transparency regarding accounts offered to students by requiring disclosure of the agreements between institutions and financial account providers as well as the costs students incur, ensure students have a choice about how to receive their federal aid, and prohibit their personal information from being shared without their consent,\" the department said.  The rules could mean schools will have to spend more time reviewing contracts with financial institutions, reviewing ATM network access, creating fee disclosures and creating lists of neutral account options for students and their parents, the Department of Education noted.  \"Financial account providers could have to deploy additional ATMs or pay fees to ATM network providers to comply with these proposed requirements,\" the department added.  The Government Accountability Office found that 11% of colleges and universities that get federal student aid have agreements with financial account providers , and about 40% of all postsecondary students are enrolled in schools with these agreements. Almost half of the schools that use college-affiliated debit and prepaid cards  to disburse financial aid are community colleges, the Department of Education said.  The public comment period is open until July 2, 2015.',\n",

       " 'Moody\\'s Cuts Chicago\\'s Debt to Junk Moody\\'s Investors Service cut its rating on Chicago\\'s debt to junk, citing expected increases in unfunded pension burdens after a ruling by the Illinois Supreme Court that overturned state pension changes.  The ratings firm dropped Chicago debt two notches to Ba1 from Baa2, with a negative outlook, saying the city\\'s options for reducing the growth of its retirement system liabilities \"have narrowed considerably.\" The ratings change could trigger about $2.2 billion in accelerated payments and fees, Moody\\'s said.  \"Whether or not the current statutes that govern Chicago\\'s pension plans stand, we expect the costs of servicing Chicago\\'s unfunded liabilities will grow, placing significant strain on the city\\'s financial operations\" in the absence of revenue growth or expense cuts, Moody\\'s said.  Chicago\\'s four pensions collectively have more than $20 billion in unfunded liabilities, and the city says it only has about half of the assets required to pay for retirement benefits. Moody\\'s cited the \"highly elevated\" pension costs as cause for a February downgrade to Chicago\\'s bond rating to two notches above junk.  Tuesday\\'s move comes after an Illinois Supreme Court decision last week to strike down the state\\'s 2013 pension overhaul. The law attempted to peel back cost-of-living adjustments to retirees and increase the retirement age for younger workers. Though the state ruling doesn\\'t directly affect the Chicago pensions, it raises the risk that the city\\'s proposed pension cuts won\\'t stand up in the courts, Moody\\'s said.  Mayor Rahm Emanuel said it was \"irresponsible\" for Moody\\'s to base its decision on the overturning of a state pension bill that didn\\'t include the city\\'s changes. The firm also failed to acknowledge the city\\'s growing economy or progress made on its financial problems, he said.  \"While Chicago\\'s financial crisis is very real and at our doorsteps, today\\'s irresponsible decision by Moody\\'s to downgrade the city\\'s credit by two steps goes far beyond that reality,\" Mr. Emanuel said.  Howard Cure, director of municipal research at Evercore Wealth Management in New York, said his firm has been avoiding Chicago general-obligation bonds \"for a while.\" But he said he was surprised Moody\\'s cut the city\\'s rating low enough to place it in junk territory.  \"It\\'s not as if the city\\'s economy is doing badly,\" Mr. Cure said. \"They\\'re actually gaining population and having growth downtown. They have some big-city problems, but it\\'s not a Detroit situation.\"  Mike Cherney and Timothy W. Martin contributed to this article.

       " \"News The beauty of diversifying your nest egg with a TFSA I have seen it many times. Clients come to me ready to retire. They have done everything right and saved hundreds of thousands in their registered retirement savings plans - but nowhere else.  They are saddled with highly taxable, restricted retirement income. Handcuffed by the mandatory minimum withdrawals, some even see their government benefits clawed back.  In their defence, they didn't have many other choices while they were saving. But today, we have tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs) and the contribution limit has just been raised to $10,000 a year.  TFSAs are a great complement to RSPs and pension plans. I often advise clients to utilize the RRSP to optimize tax refunds but to also invest in a TFSA so when they retire, they will have a nice pot of non-taxable investments for lump sum purchases.  This is especially true for those participating in their company pension plan because those funds will be highly restricted by minimum, and maximum, withdrawal amounts.  So if you dream of buying a boat or mobile home in retirement, you'll want to fund your TFSA alongside your RRSP to have the cash available.  TFSAs have been around since 2009 and people have not been too jazzed about them.  Perhaps they couldn't get excited about the amount of tax savings on the $5,500 they were initially allowed to put in each year. In the last federal budget, however, the contribution limit was raised to $10,000, making things a little more interesting.  Annual contribution limits can also be carried forward. This means if you are over 18 and have not contributed since TFSAs made their debut, you can put in $41,000 this year.  TFSAs, like RRSPs, are not investment vehicles but plans into which you put those vehicles. You register for the plan and then choose which type of investment you might wish to use within it.  People often ask whether they should invest in their RRSP or their TFSA.  RRSP contributions provide an immediate tax refund and grow tax-free, but are taxed when you take the money out. TFSAs also grow tax-free but do not provide a refund and the money is not taxed when you take it out.  The general rule is if you make less than $50,000 a year, it might be better to contribute to a TFSA because RRSPs aren't as tax-efficient for those in a lower tax bracket. You could end up paying more tax when you take it out in retirement than the tax you'll save by putting it in now.  Every case is different, however, so it's prudent to talk to a professional.  The higher contribution limits have changed the playing field. With larger limits come more creative ways to utilize a TFSA, such as transferring existing RRSPs into it.  Also, you can name a beneficiary in a TFSA, which allows for some estate planning.\",\n",
       " 'Investing Cineplex sees concession sales soar to record heights TORONTO - Moviegoers chowed down on more popcorn and burgers at Cineplex theatres over the winter, helping concession sales climb to record heights as audiences took in Hollywood hits like \"American Sniper\" and \"Fifty Shades of Grey.\"  Canada\\'s largest movie theatre company said Friday that average concession spending jumped 2.6 per cent to $5.18 per patron as customers responded to a broader selection of food options.  Some theatres recently started cooking a new selection of burgers and wraps alongside traditional favourites like popcorn and chocolate, while Cineplex has opened more VIP theatres, which let audiences order from a menu of appetizers and alcoholic beverages.  \"We are offering more choices and making them in meal sizes people can consume in the theatre,\" chief executive Ellis Jacob said in an interview.  \"With the addition of VIP, we\\'ve got a couple of new locations, and that will continue to build the revenue per person.\"  Related  Cineplex chief expects more from 2015 film lineup as Star Wars, Avengers set to draw crowds( http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/cineplex-chief-expects-more-from-2015-film-lineup-as-star-wars-avengers-set-to-draw-crowds  )  Cineplex Entertainment plans to launch complex featuring live performances, arcade games( http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/cineplex-entertainment-plans-to-launch-complex-featuring-live-performances-arcade-games  )  Jacob said concession sales rose even further last weekend, above $6 per patron, as audiences lined up for the opening of \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" across the country.  During the first quarter, Cineplex (TSX:CGX) profits more than doubled to $10.5 million, or 17 cents per share, as several hit titles eclipsed the underperforming slate from the same period last year.  Overall box office revenue declined slightly to an average of $8.90 per patron.  Even though \"American Sniper\" connected with Canadian audiences, it still managed to fall short of its astonishing performance in the U.S., where it shattered box-office records for the winter months.  About six per cent of North American box-office revenue for \"American Sniper\" came from Canada, well below the 10 per cent most films bring in, Jacob said. During the same period, British title \"The Imitation Game\" pulled in about 15 per cent of the box-office revenue, he added.  \"It was a little bit of a ladies\\' quarter,\" Jacob said, pointing to \"Cinderella\" as another successful title during the period.  Overall attendance at Cineplex theatres edged up by 1.5 per cent, but the company said it was affected by extreme winter weather in parts of Atlantic Canada and fewer 3D movies compared with the same time last year.  Total revenue at Cineplex increased 3.5 per cent to $289.8 million.  Jacob says the company\\'s efforts to diversify its business have put Cineplex in a good position, and dividends to shareholders will be going up by four per cent, starting with the payment made in June.',\n",
       " 'MORTGAGE RATES BATTLE STEPPED UP The battle between mortgage lenders to offer ultra-low rates has been stepped up, with the launch of a two-year deal with a record low rate of 1.09%.  The Co-operative Bank has launched the fixed-rate loan, which is available to borrowers with a 40% deposit who can stump up an arrangement fee of £1,499.  Charlotte Nelson, a spokeswoman for financial information website Moneyfacts, said the rate on the deal is the lowest of its kind that the website has on its records going back to 1988.  Meanwhile, Barclays has announced plans to re-launch its innovative \"family springboard\" mortgage from May 6. The mortgage helps first-time buyers with only a 5% deposit to get on the property ladder by allowing their parents to put some money equating to 10% of the house purchase price into a savings account which is then linked to the mortgage.  First-time buyers taking out the fee-free mortgage will see a stepped reduction in the interest rate they pay over a three year period. This means that in the first year, someone taking out a loan would pay a rate of 2.99%, in the second year they would pay 2.79% and in the third year they would pay 2.59%.  The reducing rate would mean that a borrower with a £180,000 loan would save £636 over the initial three-year term compared with a three-year rate at 2.99%, Barclays calculated.  After the three years is up, the money held in the savings account would be released back to the parents with interest, provided that the mortgage repayments have been kept up to date.  As well as this, Barclays is launching a new five-year fixed-rate mortgage at 1.99%. The rate is available for borrowers with a 40% deposit and comes with a £1,999 fee.  HSBC also recently launched a a five-year fixed-rate mortgage onto the market with a rate of 1.99% for people with a 40% deposit, making that deal the lowest of its kind that Moneyfacts had ever recorded.  According to Moneyfacts\\' records, the average rate on a five-year fixed rate mortgage lenders are offering across all deposit sizes was 3.55% last month, having fallen from 4.04% a year ago. Five years ago, the average five-year fix came with a rate of 5.87%.  Experts have predicted the Bank of England base rate is likely to remain at ultra-low levels for some time yet, keeping the cost of borrowing relatively low.  A recent Bank of England credit conditions survey of banks and building societies found that mortgage availability is set to increase further in the coming months.  Lenders told the Bank they expect demand for mortgages for house purchase to increase in the coming three months and that they have become more willing to lend to people with deposits under 10%.  ends',\n",
       " 'News Regulatory watch: IRA rollovers, leakage, DC plan annuities How U.S. regulators resolve key issues bearing on retirement plan assets could have significant consequences for financial service professionals and their clients, according to a new report.  Cerulli Associates explores potential regulatory changes in the retirement planning space in the April 2015 edition of \"The Cerulli Edge: U.S. Edition.\" The report examines how regulations will reshape asset and wealth management, challenges in developing a harmonized fiduciary standard that properly balances industry and investor interests, and uncovers regulatory developments governing banks.  \"Legislative guidance and policy changes are focusing on evolving the employer-sponsored [defined contribution] plan, which creates significant implication for providers across the asset management and wealth management industries,\" the report states. \"While policymakers are attempting to solve for wide-ranging issues, the proposed solutions, in many cases, encourage plan participants to leave assets in an employer sponsored plan, rather than rolling over into an individual retirement account (IRA) when they leave their employer.  \"Given the dependence of the wealth and asset management industries on rollovers as a source of assets and revenue, these legislative changes present a secular risk,\" the report adds.  The risk is particularly great for advisors. As the report notes, IRAs account for the largest component of advisors\\' book of business - 44 percent. Also a substantial part: non-qualified plans and personal trust assets for high net worth individuals (44 percent); employer-sponsored retirement plans (10 percent); and institutional assets (10 percent).  One issue of concern to Cerulli is the potential for a tightening of limitations and on marketing and sales techniques used by providers used to direct IRA rollovers from DC plans. Whatever regulatory developments may ensue, Cerulli believes the impact on advisors will be minimal. The reason: The quality of existing advisor-client relationships count for more than advertising and sales in investors\\' decision-making.  Turning to a secondary regulatory theme, leakage - assets leaving the retirement system when a plan participant separates from service - the report questions whether Department of Labor recommendations to boost consumer education about the impact of cashing out retirement saving will measurably reduce leakage.  The report suggests that other flexibility-inducing options designed to prevent leakage, such as allowing brokerage windows or \"sidecar IRAs\" inside a DC plan, could undermine adoption of qualified default investment alternatives. Among them: increasingly popular target-date funds.  Respecting a third regulatory development, the DOL\\'s permitting the use of annuities in target-date funds, Cerulli questions the wisdom of including such products in DC plans. Retirement income planning, the report argues, \"must be a process,\" as opposed to a product.  \"The process of setting a retirement income strategy is complex and multifaceted at best,\" the report states. \"Given the environment of low interest rates, which pressures both bond yields and annuity pricing, designing a retirement income plan requires some degree of advice and guidance as to optimizing current income against the necessary asset appreciation to last through a 20- or 30-year retirement.\"',\n",

Argentina: The vibrant capital city of Buenos Aires is a mix of old European architecture and trendy neighborhoods packed with cafes and designer boutiques. You can view Argentinean masterworks free at the National Museum of Fine Arts or stumble upon an impromptu tango lesson at the open-air Plaza Dorrego market on Sundays. We found round-trip flights to Buenos Aires in August and September for less than $1,000 from New York City, or about $800 if you depart from Miami.  If you want to explore the rest of the country, book a long-distance bus. These buses usually come with amenities such as lie-flat seats, meals and free wine. Wineries that give Napa a run for its money dot the country, but if you have to pick one region, choose Mendoza, which is situated along the base of the Andes Mountains. It's a 13-hour journey by bus, but a one-way ticket in first-class costs about $125 (a one-way flight would cost about $175). Expect to pay $170 to $200 for a full-day private or small-group tour, which typically includes tastings at three or four wineries, a gourmet lunch and transportation from Mendoza. Stay at one of the city's stylish boutique hotels, such as centrally located Villaggio Hotel Boutique ($125 a night in September).  Patagonia: Otherworldly Patagonia, spanning the southern ends of Argentina and Chile, teems with ice fields, mountains, steppes and aquamarine lakes. One tour that traverses these landscapes is Viva Expeditions' Southern Explorer package, starting at $3,135, plus a local fee, in November (but keep an eye out for specials online). This 12-night trip includes hiking through national parks, trekking over glaciers, boat expeditions and a visit to Ushuaia, the southernmost city in the world. Most accommodations and meals are included. A one-way flight from Buenos Aires to El Calafate, one starting point for the tour, costs about $200.  Chile: Many natural wonders abound in the north of Chile, but sticking to urban centers offers its own excitement. The towering peaks of the Andes form a backdrop to the capital, Santiago. Ski resorts are one or two hours away; you can buy a day pass for about $55 during the low season (roughly late August onward). In a beach mood? The Pacific coast is also a couple of hours away. We found flights from Boston to Santiago for $800 in September, when four-star hotels in the city average $189 a night.  Miriam Cross is a reporter at Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine.

       " 'Business Can I make use of new pension freedoms? QI\\'m just trying to find out how the new pension freedoms apply to people such as myself who have retired recently. I retired in April 2015 and the pensions I have are all annuities.  Can I cancel these and take lump sums? AK, by email Sophie Christie replies: A The pension freedoms don\\'t apply to all pension plans. The freedoms aim to give people at the point of retirement more options and greater choice in how they set up their pension income for their retirement.  From launch on April 6, the freedoms apply to personal pensions, stakeholder pensions and Sipps (selfinvested personal pensions) where benefits have yet to be taken, and income drawdown plans (where benefits are being taken). They are not available on most company pension schemes, whether in payment or not, state pensions or annuities that have already been set up.  An annuity is a financial product which is used to provide a guaranteed income for your lifetime and, where selected, your spouse as well should you die first. Annuities are offered by insurance companies and the annuity is bought using the value of your pension pot.  Danny Cox, a financial planner at Hargreaves Lansdown, said that once set up, an annuity could not be cancelled or altered. The only exception being that annuities usually come with a 30-day \"right to cancel\" whereby you can cancel the agreement and have the money returned to your pension company.  If you are still within your cancellation rights period you could exercise this and then review your options under the pension freedoms. Your annuity company will be able to tell you if you can do this. Normally the cancellation rights period starts when you sign the paperwork.  If you could cancel, the money would normally be returned to your pension provider, Mr Cox said. You would then be able to decide how you took your pension. Look at your options carefully, do your research, and take advantage of the free government Pension Wise service, which can give you guidance. Withdrawing a lump sum may seem attractive but it will be subject to income tax and it\\'s important to ensure that you will have sufficient income to live on.  If you cannot cancel your annuities they will remain as they are. However, there is a plan to allow people to \"cash in\" their annuities in the future. There is a government consultation in progress about how this might work but it is unlikely to be available, if at all, until 2016.  Mr Cox added: \"If you are able to trade in your annuity in the future, you will be exchanging your guaranteed income for a lump sum. This lump sum is likely to be lower than the amount used to buy your pension in the first place and taxable. The amount of tax will depend upon your other income in the tax year so you should check this carefully before making any decisions.\"',\n",
       " \"Average US rate on 30-year mortgage falls to 3.66 percent WASHINGTON (AP) - Average long-term U.S. mortgage rates declined this week, approaching historically low levels with the spring home-buying season underway.  Mortgage giant Freddie Mac said Thursday the national average for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage slipped to 3.66 percent from 3.70 percent last week.  The average rate for a 15-year mortgage, popular with homeowners who refinance, fell to 2.93 percent from 2.98 percent last week.  A year ago, the average 30-year mortgage rate was 4.34 percent and the 15-year rate was 3.38 percent. The 30-year average rate reached a record low of 3.35 percent in November and December 2012, when the 15-year rate hit a record low 2.66 percent.  Mortgage rates have remained low even though the Federal Reserve in October ended its monthly bond purchases, designed to hold down long-term rates. The Fed signaled recently that it's still not ready to start raising short-term rates, after keeping them near zero for over six years.  Tepid job growth in March, as shown in a government report last Friday, could make the Fed less likely to begin raising rates in June, as some have been anticipating. The Fed could decide that the economy still needs the benefit of low borrowing costs to generate healthy growth.  The Labor Department report indicated that a weakening U.S. economy spilled into the job market last month as employers added just 126,000 jobs - the fewest since December 2013.  Fed officials disagreed widely when they met last month on when they would be ready to lift rates. Minutes of the March 17-18 meeting released Wednesday show that several policymakers predicted a rate hike in June, while others concerned about low inflation didn't think a rate hike would be warranted until later this year. Still others said the economy wouldn't be strong enough for an increase until 2016.  To calculate average mortgage rates, Freddie Mac surveys lenders across the country at the beginning of each week. The average doesn't include extra fees, known as points, which most borrowers must pay to get the lowest rates. One point equals 1 percent of the loan amount.  The average fee for a 30-year mortgage was 0.6 point, unchanged from last week. The fee for a 15-year mortgage also remained at 0.6 point.  The average rate on a five-year adjustable-rate mortgage fell to 2.83 percent from 2.92 percent. The fee stayed at 0.5 point.  For a one-year ARM, the average rate was unchanged at 2.46 percent. The fee remained at 0.4 point.  FILE - In this Jan. 8, 2015 file photo, a realty sign is posted in front of a home for sale in Jackson, Miss.

       " 'Treasury must merge pension and ISA tax regimes - Michael Johnson The pensions and ISA regimes should be unified as the next logical step in the evolution of UK savings culture, Michael Johnson has said.  The Centre for Policy Studies research fellow, who earlier this year proclaimed the death of pensions, argues the current savings landscape is characterised by a \"fundamental schism\" between pensions and ISAs.  He said up-front tax relief on pension contributions should be abolished and a workplace ISA should be introduced instead of traditional retirement savings vehicles.  Johnson called for a wholesale shift from the current tax relief system attached to pensions - \\'exempt, exempt, taxed\\' (EET) - to \\'taxed, exempt, exempt\\' (TEE) relief on savings.  He said it was a logical progression of the pensions freedom and choice policy first announced in the 2014 Budget.  \"It is patently clear that tax relief and the 2014 Budget\\'s liberalisation are incompatible: the door is wide open for wholesale reform, not tinkering, of tax relief,\" said Johnson.  Johnson said in 2013-2014 pension tax relief cost in total more than £52bn, adding the system was \"inevitably regressive\" and \"inequitable and ineffective\".  The research fellow also suggested successive saving-related policy initiatives taken by the government could be seen as stepping stones towards the ultimate merger of pensions and ISAs.  These include:  * Lifetime allowance cuts  * Hikes to ISA contribution limits  * End of the \\'pensions death tax\\'  * Pensions freedom and choice  Workplace ISA  Johnson believes the framework for a workplace ISA should be introduced.  He said: \"The workplace ISA beckons. These ISAs could incorporate a form of riskpooling in decumulation (i.e. auto-protection), to spread the post-retirement inflation, investment and longevity risks that few of us are equipped to manage by ourselves.  \"Participation, however, should be optional, enabling savers to embrace the 2014 Budget\\'s post-retirement liberalisations (notably, to take cash from pension pots).\"  He added: \"Workplace ISAs should include one or more features that maintain employer participation in retirement saving provision: today, employers contribute roughly 75% of all pension contributions.  \"Any financial incentives, such as NICs rebates on employer contributions (note that TEE refers to the saver\\'s income tax, not employer NICs) should, however, probably be accompanied by some form of \\'lock-up\\' period.\"  Johnson urged employers to be consulted on any changes and said workplace ISAs should be included in auto-enrolment legislation, as well as being excluded from means-testing purposes akin to today\\'s pension assets.  He argued for a \\'big bang\\' move from the government to merge the two tax relief systems.  \"In the interests of simplicity, the UK should grasp the nettle and adopt a clean \\'big bang\\' approach to avoid some form of protracted, progressive, transition.  \"The Treasury should identify a date when EET simply ceases in respect of all future contributions.  \"Existing pension pots would close to further contributions, to be left to whither naturally, with the saver paying his marginal rate of income tax on withdrawals.\"  To view photo, click here.',\n",
       " 'News Property tax increase at 3 per cent-for now Alberni Valley News -- Property tax rates within the city of Port Alberni are proposed to increase by 3.0 per cent, following a special budget meeting on Monday, March 30.  The decision isn\\'t yet final pending the passing of the financial plan and property tax bylaws at the end of April.  The city started with a 2.8 per cent increase when budget discussions began in January, dipped to 2.2 per cent and are now hovering around 3.0 per cent.  According to city manager Ken Watson, this was based on opening the SPCA on Mondays for $16,000, an extra half-time economic development office position for $50,000, planters on Johnston Road for $10,000, city hall wooden siding for $35,000, tsunami system speaker upgrades for $43,000 and online streaming of council meetings for $15,000. A $25,000 reduction in street sweeping had also been previously approved.  Upgrading the aging telephone system in municipal government buildings and a new dedicated vehicle for the bylaw enforcement officer was approved from ERRF and will have no effect on taxation this year.  At the March 30 meeting, the manager structure pay review was approved for a cost of $50,000, despite concerns being raised that a review had been done just four years ago.  Digitizing the city\\'s GIS system was approved at a cost of $40,000, while a $30,000 external marketing contract with the Chamber of Commerce was deferred until discussion could be had with Alberni Valley Tourism.

After the meeting, Paulson clarified that he wasn\\'t against the project, just the price tag.  \"In all good conscience I can\\'t go to the taxpayer for $250,000 this year,\\' he said.  Citing his experience in fundraising for the Multiplex, Paulson said that \"I believe that there are ways of getting those projects done and not totally on the taxpayers\\' heels.\\'  While service groups had previously been called upon to help fix up Canal Beach, Coun.

       " 'get-there Good news: Millennials are savers after all When I wrote last week about the cost of not saving for retirement while you\\'re young, many of the comments from readers shared a theme: Saving is really, really difficult.  The\\xa0post\\xa0was flooded with comments like \"You can\\'t save what you don\\'t have.\" People shared stories of their personal challenges with saving while paying student loans, caring for children and struggling to find better paying jobs - all legitimate obstacles.  But a survey released this week by Bankrate.com brought some good news. Despite all of these valid reasons for not putting money away, most millennials are saving something:\\xa037 percent were saving 5 percent or less of their pay for retirement, emergencies and other financial goals.  That may not sound like much, but it is\\xa0more than double the 18 percent of people who said they weren\\'t saving anything. Plus many millennials are saving much more. Twenty percent said they were stashing 6 to 10 percent of their salaries and about one in five were saving more than 10 percent, according to the survey.  The study supports another idea I brought up last week: That many workers put off saving until they are making more money. About\\xa035 percent of households earning $50,000 to\\xa0$75,000 a year are saving more than 10 percent of their income. That compares to 19 percent of people making $30,000 to\\xa0$50,000 and 12 percent of people making $30,000 or less.  Still as I previously reported, even small contributions to a retirement savings account can go a long way when workers give the money time to grow.\\xa0Many readers shared success stories with setting up savings accounts early in their careers for which they were grateful later on.\\xa0Some of the contributions talked about were small, about $50 a paycheck.  Indeed, when retirement savings goals are broken down into small steps, they begin to look much more attainable.  Take someone earning $30,000. A 5 percent contribution to a retirement\\xa0account would amount to\\xa0less than $30 a week. That may still be a difficult sacrifice for some families, but those who can pull it off would have $1,500 saved at the end of the year\\xa0and another $225 in annual tax savings if the money goes into a tax-deferred retirement account.  Not bad, when you consider that those small steps would leave them better off than the average household. The median 401(k) balance\\xa0was $18,433 at the end of 2013, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, though savings levels varied widely.

       " 'Consumer: Investigation over pension data sales An investigation has been launched into claims millions of people\\'s pension pot details are being sold and ending up in the hands of criminals.  Pensioners\\' salaries, the value of their investments and the size of their pensions are being sold for as little as FIVE PENCE without their consent.  The financial details are allegedly being bought by fraudsters and cold-calling firms according to the Daily Mail.  The paper reports that its undercover reporters were sold pension pot details for 15,000 people without any checks being made on who they were and what they wanted the data for.  The Information Commissioner\\'s Office (ICO), the privacy watchdog, has launched an investigation into the claims and said it would be speaking to the Pensions Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority and police.  The probe comes ahead of pension reforms, which will give Britons the chance to access their full retirement pots.  Experts at the ICO have previously warned that the pension reforms on April 6 could result in a flood of scams on the scale of \"the next PPI scandal\".  Steve Eckersley, the head of enforcement at the ICO, said the revelations are \"very worrying indeed\".  He said: \"It suggests a frequent disregard of laws that are in place specifically to protect consumers. We will be launching an investigation immediately.  \"We\\'re aware of allegations raised against several companies involved in the cold-calling sector, and will be making inquiries to establish whether there have been any breaches of the Data Protection Act or Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.  \"The ICO has powers to issue companies with fines of up to £500,000 for the most serious breaches of the Data Protection Act, while we can also pursue criminal prosecutions around unlawfully obtaining or accessing personal data.\"  An ICO spokesman said it appeared that some firms were getting their hands on pension details because some people do not read the terms and conditions of contracts they sign, leaving them open to having their personal data accessed.  However, he said that it appeared some companies were getting and selling on the information unlawfully.  Some details appear to have been stolen, while other firms appear to have kept personal information when they should have deleted it.  Discussing the pension reforms, Mr Eckersley added: \"The information we\\'ve been shown supports the work we\\'ve been doing to target the shady industry that operates behind the nuisance of cold calls and spam texts.\"  PENSION REFORMS COME INTO FORCE  About half a million older savers will be handed radical new freedoms as a \"new pensions culture\" dawns next week.  From April 6 onwards, people aged 55 and over will be deciding what to do with retirement savings.  When people come to retire, they will no longer be required to use their pension pot to buy a retirement annuity.  Under the new reforms, older savers will be able to access their pots how they wish, subject to their marginal rate of income tax.',\n",

AGS will give Amaya $461 million in cash and a $15-million note due on the eighth anniversary of the deal closing for the shares of Amaya Americas Corp., the indirect parent of Cadillac Jack.

       " \"My First Home Homes Cutting the costs of home ownership Owning a home is a dream for many people. But even the most affordable homes can be a considerable expense, which is why many homeowners are on constant lookout for ways to cut the costs of home ownership.  Men and women who have owned their homes for years may already know of various ways they can save money each month.  But first-time homeowners may not be so savvy, which can leave them scrambling for ways to save each month. Fortunately, homeowners can reduce the cost of owning their homes in a variety of ways.  Refinance your mortgage: The average homeowner would point to his or her mortgage payment as his or her biggest monthly expense. First-time homeowners may assume they have no leeway with regard to lowering that payment, but that's not necessarily true.  Interest rates fluctuate every day, and homeowners might be able to take advantage of that fluctuation by refinancing their mortgages to earn lower interest rates. Depending on the amount of the loan, a homeowner might be able to save hundreds of dollars per month and tens of thousands of dollars over the life of the loan after refinancing his or her mortgage. Research current interest rates to determine if refinancing is in your best interest.  Reexamine your insurance policy: When borrowing money to buy a home, borrowers need to have homeowner's insurance. It's easy to forget these policies and simply pay the premium each month. But homeowners looking to save money should periodically reexamine their policies and compare these existing policies to those they might be able to get from other providers.  Comparison shopping can save homeowners substantial amounts of money. Homeowners willing to purchase their homeowners and auto insurance policies from the same provider also can save a considerable amount of money, sometimes as much as 15% depending on the provider.  Make safety upgrades: Another way to cut the cost of home ownership is to upgrade your home's safety features. Many insurance companies offer discounts to homeowners who install alarm systems, sprinklers or storm shutters in their homes.  But homeowners should confirm their eligibility for such discounts before making any upgrades, as policies may differ depending on the provider.  Purchase eco-friendly appliances for your home: The appliances in your home at the time of purchase will inevitably wear down, and replacing such items can be expensive. But replacing older appliances with more eco-friendly alternatives can save you money on your monthly utility bills, as more and more appliances are now made with energy savings in mind.  Cutting your energy consumption leads to lower utility bills, and you may even be eligible for government rebates when buying products that meet certain energy-saving standards.  The cost of home ownership is on the rise, but homeowners can take several steps to alleviate those costs.

       " 'Financial Post Investing Why Fed\\'s huge US$5.4T balance sheet could steer rate-hike policy The normalization of U.S. Federal Reserve policy is supposed to go like this: First, the central bank begins to hike rates, then it allows maturing securities to run off, which results in its balance sheet shrinking.  But since the Fed has expanded its balance sheet to US$5.4-trillion from US$900-billion in August 2008, things might go a little different this time around. That\\'s in large part because the US$210-billion of treasury securities held in the Fed\\'s System Open Market Account (SOMA) mature in 2016, with roughly two-thirds of that maturing in the first part of the year.  \"This implies that the Federal Reserve will have to make decisions about the trajectory of monetary policy between now and the start of 2016,\" said Scotiabank economist Dov Zigler.  He thinks indecision would be a difficult and increasingly unpalatable option, equivalent to tightening monetary policy as the Fed\\'s balance sheet would shrink.  Doing nothing, Mr. Zigler pointed out, means that the Fed\\'s balance sheet would contract by as much as US$1.1-trillion through 2019 just from maturing Treasury securities alone.  Of course, treasuries mature regularly, and did so as the Fed expanded its balance sheet. With the largest maturities from SOMA beginning at the end of 2018, the economist doesn\\'t think it will be a very appealing policy for the Fed to roll over more than US$1-trillion of securities.  As a result, Mr. Zigler thinks it is more likely that the Fed stops reinvesting the proceeds of maturing treasury securities at some point in the next couple of years, and perhaps in early 2016.  Some of the principal can still be reinvested, but either way, the process will be key to the Fed\\'s gradual roll-back of its stimulus efforts that were triggered by the financial crisis.  If the U.S. economy takes a turn for the worse, the Fed can always reinvest maturing securities in a manner that aims to match the current composition of its balance sheet.  However, Mr. Zigler considers this unlikely since the Fed has a large proportion of longer-dated treasuries in its holdings, which have an estimated 100-basis-point impact on the benchmark 10-year treasury note. Nonetheless, maturity extension is always a tool in the Fed\\'s kit.  \"If the FOMC were to wish to maintain an accommodative policy indefinitely, it would have to either gain comfort with holding a very large share of short-term treasury securities or engage in a variant of its maturity extension program,\" Mr. Zigler said. \"A more likely alternative is the eventual normalization of the balance sheet\\'s size probably in a fashion that avails itself of the run-off of the Fed\\'s holdings of securities - which starts to happen of its own volition next year, thereby necessitating choices in the coming months.\"',\n",

Anyone who contributed to British government-backed defined benefit schemes, such as the NHS and teaching profession, have less than three weeks to repatriate their funds, says West Coast Wealth Management consultant Mark Gibbons.  â|(80)|(9C)After April 2 you will no longer have the right to transfer the funds held in these accounts to either another British or foreign qualifying recognised overseas pension schemes (QROPS), â|(80)|(9C) Mr Gibbons said. â|(80)|(9C)This has forced many ex-pats to take action and seek the advice of the financial services industry around the world to assess the viability to remove their funds from their UK scheme.â|(80)|(9D)  Mr Gibbons said the changes to the British pension system were made to address the countryâ|(80)|(99)s looming retirement crisis.  â|(80)|(9C)It was a system forged in the times when life expectancy was 67, there was a young working population and all members of society worked from the age of 18 to 65,â|(80)|(9D) Mr Gibbons said. â|(80)|(9C)Times have changed.  â|(80)|(9C)The UK has an ageing population as life expectancy has risen. Many people do not enter the workforce until 22, which means that the schemes that relied upon the contributions of the workforce to pay for the pensioners have severe funding issues.  â|(80)|(9C)The population also has an issue funding their retirement as you have on average 38 years of working life to pay for nearly 30 years of retirement.  â|(80)|(9C)As a result, all but three of the top FTSE 100 companies have closed their final salary schemes, several schemes have very publicly gone into administration and others have a pension deficit so large that it would not be satisfied even if they were to liquidate all of their assets.â|(80)|(9D)  Mr Gibbons warned Your Money readers to think carefully before moving funds.  â|(80)|(9C)Many financial advisers would happily have you believe that this is the right thing to do as they will ultimately profit from their movement,â|(80)|(9D) he said. â|(80)|(9C)However, every pension fund is unique, as is every personâ|(80)|(99)s situation. Even if you do decide to move them the trepidation does not stop there as you may be liable for up to 55 per cent tax when the money leaves the UK.  â|(80)|(9C)This remains in place for five clear tax years after your exit from the country, and you may even be taxed at your highest marginal rate when the funds reach Australia, leaving you far from prepared for retirement.â|(80)|(9D)  To see if you have funds from that working holiday in London visit www.gov.uk/find-lost-pension',\n",
       " \"Redfin; Redfin: 2015 Could Be the Biggest Year for Housing since the Bust 2015 MAR 13 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Real Estate Weekly News -- 2015 is shaping up to be the biggest year for real estate since the great recession, according to Redfin (www.redfin.com), the customer-first real estate brokerage. Redfin customers requesting home tours, an early indicator of housing market performance, jumped nearly 50 percent from a year ago and the number of newly listed homes for sale rose to the highest level since mid-2013, setting the stage for accelerating growth in the housing market in 2015, according to a Redfin analysis that tracks thousands of homebuyers across the country.  More sellers are putting properties on the market, too. The number of homes listed for sale increased 6.3 percent in January from a year earlier. More homes went on the market in January than any other month since August 2013.  The growing supply of homes for sale already has put the brakes on rising prices, a trend Redfin expects to continue. Price growth has slowed every month since November, and Redfin predicts median sale prices will rise only 3.5 percent this month, the smallest increase since February 2012, when prices rose 2.9 percent.  Competition is fierce in several markets, such as Denver, where the median number of days homes spent on the market was 15. Last January, that number was 57, roughly six weeks longer. In Nashville, where inventory is down 14.2 percent year over year, Redfin agent Mel Priess reports that every offer he has written in the past week has faced a bidding war. In one situation, an multi-family home for sale received 17 offers by the end of its first showing.

       " \"Pensions Scottish Widows to pioneer cash withdrawals under pension freedom reforms - but you must take at least £5k at a time Insurance firm Scottish Widows is to allow existing customers to use their pensions to take out cash.  From April, under new pension freedoms, savers will be able to take their cash as they like. In theory, they should be able to use their pensions like a bank account, and every time they make a withdrawal a quarter of it should be tax free.  However, not all firms offer this service yet because it is complex to set up. Scottish Widows has announced it will be one of the first companies to allow savers to do this.  Customers must opt for a service called Partial Pension Encashment. There are no charges to take out cash but the least someone can withdraw is £5,000 each time.  However, people who take large sums from their pension could face a hefty tax bill.  Under pension freedom, everyone aged over 55 is suddenly going to get unfettered access to their whole pension pot - but just like now, only 25 per cent of retirement savings will be tax-free while the rest will be taxed as income.  Workers used to simply paying the basic rate of tax through employers might not realise that dipping too freely into their pension pot at retirement will put them into the higher rate tax bracket and on the hook to the taxman for more than they expected.  The possibility of people paying more than necessary was recently highlighted by research showing many in defined contribution pensions - those that will be affected by the freedom reforms - are baffled by both pensions and the tax system.  Go here to find out how to avoid paying too much tax on pension cash after April.  WHAT IS PENSION FREEDOM?  'Pension freedom' reforms will give people greater power over how they spend, save or invest their retirement pots from next April.  Key changes include removing the need to buy an annuity to provide income until you die, giving access to invest-and-drawdown schemes previously restricted to wealthier savers, and the axing of a 55 per cent 'death tax' on pension pots left invested.  Also, savers won't be limited to one chance to take a single tax-free lump sum worth 25 per cent of their pension pots, with the rest taxed as income afterwards.  Instead, Chancellor George Osborne has announced that people will be able to dip in and make as many withdrawals as they want, each time getting 25 per cent tax-free and the rest taxed like income.  The changes apply to people with 'defined contribution' or 'money purchase' pension schemes, which take contributions from both employer and employee and invest them to provide a pot of money at retirement.  They don't apply to those with more generous gold-plated 'final salary' pensions which provide a guaranteed income after retirement.\",\n",
       " \"ABI urges softer approach to improve retirement choices Pension providers should send communications to customers that are with less 'intimidating' and reduce fear and apprehension about retirement decision making, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI).  In a report published today, commissioned by the ABI and written by Ideas42, 'Freedom and Choice in Pension: A Behavioural Perspective' the ABI found that the complexities of real life decision making meant that, when it came to retirement choices, consumers were disengaged from the process, made last-minute choices under pressure, failed to shop around, failed to seek guidance or advice and chose sub-optimal products.  It has made several reccomendations including a cooling-off period after product purchase and calls for providers to be careful not to overload customers with information in the pre-retirement communications they send out, the main one being a 'wake up pack', which providers must send customers as their retirement data approaches.  Huw Evans (pictured), director general, ABI said: 'This report provides new in-depth analysis of how customers are likely to behave when they approach the new pension freedoms that begin this April. This is a must read for everyone committed to making these reforms a success and improving retirement outcomes for savers.'  In a bid to improve the situation the ABI in its report recommended several changes to the way providers communicate with customers. These include:  Having pension providers send a shorter, less intimidating communication before the full wake-up pack. Building on the ABI's existing Code of Conduct on Retirement Choices to create a more behaviourally informed wake-up pack that reduces information overload and mitigates fear and apprehension. Maximising uptake of Pension Wise guidance, for example by clearly signposting people towards the service at age 55. Mitigating fear by ensuring that interactions are friendly in tone, and take into account the apprehension and decision paralysis that can result from sending customers a large amount of information that is difficult to comprehend. Prompt people who have been automatically enrolled into a pension scheme to make a choice about the level of their contributions every year. Using employers to provide timely prompts to encourage their employees to engage in retirement planning early. Developing a cross-industry standards to categorise product offerings in order to make comparison easier. An independent audit system in which providers of information on pensions are given a 'seal of approval' if they meet the required standards. Introducing cool-off periods or additional steps when people seek to withdraw more than a certain proportion of their pot. The report follows a thematic review of providers' sales practices by the Financial Conduct Authority. It found that an ABI code of practice has failed to improve providers' annuity sales practices and said it would seek to override it with new regulations.  In March 2013 the ABI introduced its Code of Conduct on Retirement Choices, which was compulsory for all ABI members as a condition of membership and outlines how firms should communicate retirement choices to clients.\",\n",
       " 'DB Plan Investment Consultants Looking Globally for Growth With traditional fixed-income investments continuing to provide unattractive returns, consultants to defined benefit retirement plans are looking for opportunities overseas.  A new report from Cerulli Associates notes that during the past year, robust equity markets decreased the value of pension liabilities, and resulted in improved funding levels for many corporate defined benefit (DB) plans.  As more pension plans\\' funded status is enhanced, those that are on liability-driven investing (LDI) glidepaths will start to reduce their return-seeking risky assets and replace them with fixed income. More than half (56%) of investment consultants surveyed by Cerulli indicated they are likely to increase their corporate DB clients\\' U.S. fixed-income exposure during the next one- to two-year period.  However, with traditional fixed-income investments continuing to provide unattractive returns, consultants are looking for opportunities overseas. Gatekeepers expect to increase corporate DB pension allocations to less-efficient, non-U.S. fixed-income markets, including emerging markets. More than half (56%) expressed plans to boost international fixed-income positions. Furthermore, while 38% of consultants expect to increase corporate DB plans\\' emerging markets equity and debt allocations, one-quarter will likely decrease equity exposure and 13% plan to decrease debt allocations.  According to the Cerulli report, emerging and frontier markets are among the least efficient and have the most dynamic and fastest-growing economies worldwide, presenting opportunity in both fixed-income and equity markets for investors. For these reasons, institutions are including these assets in their portfolios as sources of growth, income, and diversification.  Favorable demographics of an emergent middle class that should drive demand for consumer goods support anticipated expansion in these regions. As these economies develop, a move away from their export dependence to becoming a consumer market, similar to western cultures, will likely occur.  On the public side, Cerulli notes, DB pensions continue struggling to achieve actuarial returns between 7.5% and 8%. To help meet these high return targets, survey results indicate that consultants expect increased exposure to emerging markets and alternative investments. Forty percent of consultants plan to raise their public DB pension clients\\' allocations to hedge funds, and 47% anticipate increasing exposure to private equity and venture capital during the next one- to two-year period. Moreover, 44% of gatekeepers expect to add other private investment allocations.  Consultants also plan to ratchet up allocations to emerging market debt and equity for these institutions, as import demand from developed economies should continue in the near term. More than half (53%) of consultants said they are likely to increase public DB plans\\' exposure to emerging market equities, and 60% expect to boost allocation to emerging market debt during the next one to two years.  Cerulli\\'s first quarter 2015 \"The Cerulli Edge - Institutional Edition\" explores the central role investment consultants play in asset allocation for institutional investors and also identifies opportunities for asset managers in sovereign wealth funds.

       " \"Pensions Week: Talking head Defined contribution - Investment lessons from DB The last 10 years have seen a massive rise in defined contribution pension provision, fuelled by a combination of employers moving away from defined benefit schemes and the introduction of auto-enrolment.  Historically, trustees operating DC arrangements have provided members with a range of investment fund options in which they could put their allocated pots of savings, with more than 90 per cent invested in a default fund.  Is such an approach in the interests of members, particularly for larger DC occupational pension schemes, some of which now have more than GBP100m in assets (and growing)? I am reminded of the award-winning Smash Martians instant potato television adverts of the 1970s, in which a group of aliens came to earth and laughed at us humans for spending time peeling and boiling potatoes.  Might the same Smash Martians coming to the UK in 2016 laugh at DC pension trustees and say something like, 'First they divide their fund into tiny little pots, then they boil them in a passive equity fund for thirty years'?  Trustees of DB schemes have similar legal duties to act in their members' interests, yet invest assets in a completely different way. Instead of earmarking assets to a particular member, a DB fund is operated on a pooled basis and invested among a wide range of asset classes. This allows for more diversification of risk and produces a greater level of investment return.  Figures from Barnett Waddingham show that over the last five years larger DB schemes have achieved an investment return of about 9.5 per cent a year. Figures on the average returns for DC plans are not as easy to come by. One report suggested that the return on some default funds could be as low as 3.5 per cent annually over the last three years.  Albert Einstein appreciated the power of compound interest, which he compared to the eighth wonder of the world.  To put that into context, over five years an average large DB fund would turn GBP1,000 into more than GBP1,500 - which is GBP340 better than a low-performing DC default fund might produce.  Of course, there would be administration challenges in substantially changing the way DC plans invest on behalf of their members.  But there is no legal reason why it could not be done, and the complexity is unlikely to be greater than that involved in implementing a liability-driven investment strategy for a large DB scheme.  Surely we owe it to DC members to take up the challenge.  If we stay as we are, DC member outcomes could be significantly lower, and we run the risk that industry standard default funds are reliant on FTSE tracker funds, inflating equity values and creating a monster Ponzi scheme.  But then again I am just a lawyer, so what do I know?  Duncan Buchanan is president of the Society of Pension Professionals and partner at law firm Hogan Lovells\",\n",

       " \"Business IT'S YOUR MONEY: Diversified asset allocation critical to maximize returns By jane young -  When investing money, one of the first decisions to make is your asset allocation - the division of your assets into investments such as stock mutual funds, bonds, real estate or cash.  To maximize the return on your portfolio, it's crucial to maintain a well-diversified asset allocation. According to many financial experts, asset allocation may be your single most important investment decision, more important than the specific investments or funds that you select.  There is no one-size-fits-all; the right asset allocation is based on your unique situation which may change as your circumstances or perspective changes. Some major factors to consider include investment time horizon, the need for liquidity, risk tolerance, risks taken in other areas of your life and how much risk is required to achieve your goals.  Arriving at the appropriate asset allocation is largely a balance between risk and return. If you want or need a higher return, you will have to assume a higher level of risk.  If you have a long investment time horizon, you can take on more risk because you don't need your money right away and you can ride out fluctuations in the market.  However, if you have a short time horizon, you should minimize your risk so your money will be readily available.  To minimize risk, invest in fixed income investments such as money market accounts, certificate of deposits, high quality bonds or short-term bond funds.  If you are willing to take on more risk with the expectation of getting higher returns, consider stock mutual funds. Generally, avoid investing money in the stock market if you'll need it in the next five years. However, the stock market is an excellent option for long-term money.  Regardless of your situation, the best allocation is usually a combination of fixed income and stock mutual funds. With a diversified portfolio, you can take advantage of higher returns found in the stock market while buffering your risk and meeting short-term needs with fixed-income investments.  Once your target asset allocation is set, rebalance on annual basis to stay on target. Rebalancing will automatically result in selling investments that are high and buying investments that are low.  Avoid changing your target allocation based on emotional reactions to short-term market fluctuations. Stick to your plan unless there are major changes in your circumstances.  If you are unsure where to start, a good rule of thumb is to subtract your age from 120 to arrive at the percentage you should invest in stock market. In the past it was customary to subtract from 100, but this has increased as life expectancies and the time one spends in retirement have increased.  In the final analysis, select an asset allocation that meets your specific needs and gives you peace of mind.  -  Jane Young is a certified financial planner.

       " 'Living Vacation homes: healthy alternatives and adventure Winter\\'s chill can inspire warm thoughts of vacation plans ahead. Whether getaway goals involve beach views or mountain vistas, interest in renting a home away from home, rather than a hotel room, is heating up for many travelers.  Pluses include the extra space and freedom to define your way to relax. Some might get up early for a run and others in the group might get up late and eat a bowl of cereal in their pajamas.  Dining out is part of discovering a destination\\'s charms, but it\\'s nice to be able to cook at least some meals in a vacation home. It\\'s often less expensive and can be a healthier alternative because you have more control over meals prepared in your own kitchen.  Kitchen adventures  Cooking on vacation is part of the fun for food lovers. That\\'s what I experienced when visiting the Dordogne region of southwestern France. With the dream setting of Chateaux Le Secretary located near the Medieval village of Monflanquin as our base, we shopped open air markets for regional cheeses, honey, breads, fresh fruits and vegetables and locally produced wines.  The fully equipped outdoor kitchen complete with a long wooden farmhouse table overlooking the swimming pool was the ideal spot to dine and imagine you actually lived in a French chateau.  Venturing out to explore the countryside and cobblestoned villages led us to quaint restaurants for dinner.  But it was back to the chateau to lounge in the living room for late-night drinks and then up in the morning for leisurely breakfasts in the cozy kitchen reminiscent of downstairs at \"Downton Abbey.\" Culinary adventures included a hands-on cooking class at La Cambe.  Owner and cookbook author Jane Whalley led us through lessons in French cookery including a roasted red pepper and aubergine (eggplant) terrine with local goat cheese and a dessert tart with almond paste and fresh pears.  The portfolio of places you can arrange through international travel companies such as Wyndham Vacation Rentals has all kinds of options.  My week in France was split between the restful chateau and operating a houseboat up and down the River Lot. With the help of an instruction book thankfully translated into English, you learn to open and close the river locks yourself, climbing up and down ladders and throwing lines to fellow shipmates. No, it wasn\\'t easy or relaxing but it was a good work out.  I decided I\\'d be best as captain of the galley and deliver hot tea and French pastries to the braver souls navigating up on deck. One thing for sure, vacation rentals can turn fantasy into reality, even if it\\'s just for one fabulous week.

The recently mailed senior applications are for the 2014 property taxes, which are paid in calendar year 2015. The savings from the exemptions will appear on the second installment tax bills that will likely be mailed in late June of 2015 and will be due August 1, 2015.  There are two senior tax exemptions:  * The Senior Exemption, available to all seniors regardless of income, reduces property taxes by about $400-$500. It is available to any owner-occupied residential property if the owner was born in 1949 or earlier.  * The Senior Freeze may provide some seniors with additional savings if the combined 2013 income of all members of the household was less than $55,000, and if the senior has been an owner-occupant of the property since January 1, 2013.  INFORMATION FOR SENIORS WHO DID NOT RECEIVE MAILINGS  Homeowners who were born in 1949 turned age 65 in 2014, and thus are likely to be eligible for one of the senior exemptions for the first time. Taxpayers who recently turned 65 will probably not receive applications when the senior renewal forms are mailed. Such individuals are encouraged to call the Property Tax Assessment Review Office at 847-448-8168 to obtain the forms and information necessary to receive the senior exemptions. The forms are also available online at CookCountyAssessor.com.  INFORMATION FOR HOMEOWNER EXEMPTION  Homeowners who purchased a home in 2013, and possibly 2014, may be eligible to receive the Homeowner Exemption, which would reduce property taxes by about $600-$700, if the home is their primary residence. New homeowners will only need to apply for the Homeowner Exemption once. It will be automatically applied each year thereafter.  LAW ON ERRONEOUS EXEMPTIONS RELATING TO SENIORS  Owners of properties that erroneously receive tax exemptions can be made to repay the tax savings from any exemption for which they are not eligible. To avoid erroneous senior citizen exemptions, it is important to understand the eligibility rules for such exemptions. Although generally straightforward, the rules can be confusing when a senior moves.  If a senior was in residence on January 1, 2014, the property should be eligible for the 2014 senior exemptions (paid in 2015), even if the senior citizen no longer lives on the property. However, in most cases, the property will not be eligible for senior tax exemptions in subsequent years.  Residents with questions about eligibility for the senior exemptions should call Mitzi Gibbs, Tax Assessment Reviewer, at 847-448-8168.

       " 'Investment Adviser: Fixed Income - January 2015. Is 2015 a bad year to own bonds?  At the start of 2014, investors were preparing for a year in which the US and UK central banks would hike interest rates and global growth would pick up.  Instead, US Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, defied expectations and held interest rates.  So the fact that fixed income performed quite so well in 2014 took many investors by surprise.  Ben Bennett, credit strategist at Legal & General Investment Management, explains: \"At the beginning of the year most people anticipated higher interest rates, particularly in the US but also the UK. Most people assumed interest rates would be going up throughout the year and rising interest rates generally isn\\'t good for total returns, of course. So most people expected low but positive total returns for the year.\"  Instead, it was a good year for fixed income and those investors who held fixed income assets in their portfolios would have seen decent returns.  Mr Bennett says: \"Everything actually shoved interest rates lower rather than higher, which led to very good returns for fixed income assets, outperforming equity markets, particularly in the UK where the FTSE [100] ended down on the year.\"  He says sterling investment-grade corporate bonds delivered a total return of 12.5 per cent last year, but cautions that it will be difficult to repeat that performance in 2015.  Towards the end of last year investors remained undeterred from investing in certain areas of fixed income. According to the latest figures from the Investment Association (formerly the IMA), fixed income was among the top-five selling sectors in November 2014. During the month, Sterling Strategic Bond funds recorded net retail sales of GBP144m, making it the fourth bestselling sector, up from its eighteenth-place ranking the previous month.  Jon Jonsson, manager of the Neuberger Berman Global Bond Absolute Return fund, hails 2014 as a surprising year for fixed income.  He comments: \"Fixed income certainly overall performed quite strongly but I think the composition of returns was somewhat of a surprise, where riskier assets underperformed expectations and government bonds and the risk-free assets performed much better than expected.\"  It would seem the fixed income market is at the whim of central banks\\' monetary policies. So the question for fixed income investors is, where will returns come from in 2015?  Typically, in an environment where monetary policy is being tightened in the US and UK, investors might expect lower returns but, as they saw in 2014, perhaps they should be prepared to expect the unexpected.  Mr Jonsson insists fixed income should retain its place in an investor\\'s portfolio as a form of diversification, although questions remain around the composition of fixed income assets.  He adds: \"You should still have fixed income representation; it\\'s just a question of the mix of duration risk and the credit risk.\"  Ellie Duncan is deputy features editor at Investment Adviser  111102506',\n",

       " \"Investing What you need to know before markets open U.S. stock index futures are rising today as lower growth forecasts from the International Monetary Fund spurred hopes that central banks would take more aggressive policy stances to accelerate economic improvement. While the lower forecasts implied less demand for fuel over the next two years, contributing to another leg lower in crude oil prices, Wall Street stocks were on track for a second straight day of gains, after a rally of more than 1% on Friday.  The IMFlowered its forecasts( http://business.financialpost.com/2015/01/19/imf-cuts-global-growth-forecast-amid-sizable-uncertainty-about-oil-price-path/ ) for global economic growth in both 2015 and 2016, projecting growth of 3.5% this year and 3.7% next year; both forecasts are down by 0.3 percentage points. The IMF advised advanced economies to maintain accommodative monetary policies to avoid increases in real interest rates as cheaper oil increases the risk of deflation.  U.S. crude futures fell 1.8% to $47.80 per barrel, keeping the commodity - which is down more than 55% since June - near its lowest level since 2009.  While cheap gas prices could be a boon to consumer spending, many analysts are waiting to see whether the net impact on the economy will be positive, given the decline in energy company earnings that is expected. Halliburton Co is scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday.  The Canadian dollar fell 0.44 of a cent to 83.26 cents US a day before the Bank of Canada makes its next interest rate announcement.  Morgan Stanley reported a drop of 81% in revenue from trading fixed-income securities, currencies and commodities, though earnings rose on a sharp drop in legal costs. Shares fell 1.7% to $34.29 in premarket trading.  Johnson & Johnson reported fourth-quarter net income decreased by 28% to $2.52 billion or 89 cents per share. Earnings ex-items came to $1.27 per share, two cents ahead of estimates. The world's biggest maker of health care products posted revenue of $18.25 billion in the period, missing Street forecasts of $18.51 billion.  FXCM Inc plummeted 81% to $2.40 in premarket trading on volume of nearly 430,000 shares, making it the most active premarket name on the New York Stock Exchange. The retail foreign exchange broker on Friday said it would get a $300 million loan from Leucadia National Corp to keep operating after losing millions from a recent surge of the Swiss franc. Late Monday, FXCM provided further details on the terms of the loan.  Investors continued to assess effects of the move by the Swiss National Bank on Thursday to lift the cap on the Swiss franc. The decision could foreshadow a large stimulus by the European Central Bank next week that would further weaken the euro, or be a safeguard against a possible Greek exit from the eurozone that could potentially destabilize the bloc.Â© Thomson Reuters 2015\",\n",
       " 'Globe Investor Is oil due for a bounce? Ask the futures sbarlow@globeandmail.com  A small minority of energy experts forecasted a 2014 decline in crude oil prices, but no credible source predicted it would be anywhere near as bad as it was.  Even the short-term outlook for the oil price appears, despite reams of unsuccessful attempts by analysts and strategists worldwide, almost unknowable.  But former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. economist Jim O\\'Neill believes he\\'s found an indicator that cuts through the clutter and can provide investors with an accurate signal for the oil price: Five year West Texas Intermediate futures.  In a recent column for online magazine Project Syndicate, Mr. O\\'Neill wrote that \"the five-year forward price is much less influenced by speculation in the oil market than the spot price, and more representative of true commercial needs. So when the five-year price starts moving in a different direction than the spot price, I take notice.\"  In other words, Mr. O\\'Neill believes that hedge funds and other volatile sources of \"hot money\" are not involved in futures contracts 60 months out. The five-year futures price represents the sober and more accurate supply-and-demand calculations of the oil producers themselves.  The chart above shows how the five-year futures indicator has worked. (Long-term data for the futures market was only available on an annual basis, but the current price is quoted at $67.40 U.S.). The most obvious characteristic of the five-year futures index is that it is less volatile than the spot price. This was most notable in December, 2008, when the spot price had plunged 53 per cent from its recent peak, whereas the futures price had only fallen 13.5 per cent.  Importantly, and to Mr. O\\'Neill\\'s point, the futures price in December, 2008, proved a far better indicator of the spot price for the next two years. The chart implies that the buying in the spot price between 2006 and 2008 was excessively optimistic, and that the subsequent selloff price represented an overshoot to the downside.  Hindsight is 20/20, but investors who were following the futures price in late 2008 could easily have inferred that the energy sector was underpriced relative to its future prospects.  Virtually any energy-related investment made at that time would have generated extraordinary returns.  Current readings provide reasons for optimism in energy markets, but not a full recovery to peak levels. If Mr. O\\' Neill\\'s theory is correct - and as he points out in the piece, before his successful career at Goldman Sachs he wrote his PhD thesis on oil markets - the five-year oil future price of $67.40 a barrel is a better indicator of where the crude price will be in the months and years ahead. This estimate is far lower than the heady days of $100-and-above WTI prices, but far better than the current spot price of approximately $46.',\n",
       " 'BUSINESS FATCA leads MFs to avoid fresh investments from US investors New Delhi, Jan 11 (PTI) Stringent compliance requirements under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act of the US have led to several mutual fund houses avoiding fresh investments from American investors.  To lower the reporting burden, many mutual funds including HDFC MF, ICICI Prudential MF, Quantum MF and Baroda Pioneer MF, DSP Blackrock MF have even barred investment from residents of US and Canada for some of their schemes, while others are not very keen on investments from such entities.  Moreover, some MFs may even stop taking investments from NRIs till a clarity emerges over FATCA agreement between India and the US.  FATCA is a US law whereby foreign financial institutions across the world would have to report to the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on any transactions of clients who could be subjected to American tax laws.  The non-compliance with FATCA entails 30 per cent withholding tax on the US source payments. Moreover, wrong or incorrect reporting may also have similar consequences.  While India and the US had agreed \"in substance\" last year to sign an Inter-Governmental Agreement over FATCA, the final pact could not be signed within the earlier deadline of December 31, 2014 and it had to be extended.  All financial institutions with exposure to the US were also required to register with the US tax department IRS under FATCA before January 1, 2015, RBI and Sebi had said late last month, but many Indian entities are yet to do so.  The US taxpayers under FATCA include US citizens, US residents (green card holders) and non-residents who own foreign financial accounts or other offshore assets.  Industry insiders says that MFs have stopped taking fresh investments from the US citizens because of stringent compliance laws.  \"Most of the fund houses have stopped taking investment from citizens of US and Canada. Accepting investment from them means more paper work and more compliance,\" Quantum AMC CEO Jimmy Patel said.  Raghvendra Nath, Managing Director at Ladderup Wealth Management said: \"Most MFs in India as well as other institutions are now refusing money from US based NRIs.\"  WealthRays Securities Director Rashmi Roddam said: \"Since the disclosures are high, even US NRI\\'s are reluctant in investing into Indian mutual funds and so are mutual fund companies.\"  \"Many of the mutual funds are discouraging or rejecting NRI investment considering complexity and cost of compliance along with huge punishment for the mistake making the situation worse for the Indian mutual funds,\" said Abnish Kumar Sudhanshu, Director-cum-Research Head at Amrapalu Aadya.  All Indian financial institutions including stock exchanges, mutual funds, portfolio managers and depositories with exposure to the US were required to register with the American tax authorities by December 31.  \"The FATCA provisions will have a big impact on flows from US,\" Nath added.  \"The Indian mutual fund industry, which is attracting a significant flow from NRIs is likely to be impacted by new FATCA,\" Sudhanshu said.

       " 'Buy Gold With 401k: Retirement Planning And IRA Rollover Options Revealed; Invest While The Price Of Gold Is Low John Paulson who invested $4.6 billion in gold said: \"I view gold as a currency, not a commodity. It\\'s importance as a currency will continue to increase as the major central banks around the world continue to print money.\"  Experts discuss gold buying opportunities and whether it\\'s a good idea to rollover 401k and IRA to gold while the price of gold are still low.  Experts predict that price of gold price will increase from 2016-2023, and many of them forecast that the prices will go over $1941 in eight to ten years. It is believed that the price of gold has already hit its bottom.  The price of gold can fluctuate in the short period of time, however, it always increases its value in the long run. Gold investment has always been the best protection against inflation and currency devaluation.  Over the last year the price of gold has remained almost unchanged - $1175 last week versus $1205 in the beginning of 2014. Despite predictions of gold crash in 2014, price of gold remained stable.  For people who are looking for a long-term investment buying gold while the prices are still low is definitely a good investment opportunity at this time. For example, a person who had purchased $33,000 of gold in 2001 can sell that gold in 2015 for about $129,551.12 which is over 300% return on investment. In current market conditions most 401k and IRAs haven\\'t perform nearly as good.  It\\'s no secret that even during toughest economic conditions investment in gold has always been the safest option and, therefore, it is the best protection against irresponsible governments. Gold is used in many industries and is always in demand due to its limited supply and the fact that it can\\'t be manufactured.

According to news originating from Atlanta, Georgia, by VerticalNews correspondents, research stated, \"Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Access to care has been identified as a significant factor affecting hypertension treatment and control.\"  Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Center for Disease Control and Prevention, \"We examined disparities in access to care among US adults with self-reported hypertension. Using Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2011 data, we identified US adults with self-reported hypertension. Access to care was assessed based on responses to questions about health insurance, having an identified personal doctor, and cost barriers to visiting a doctor. We assessed access to care by geographic location (ie, US state) and selected sociodemographic characteristics. Overall, 159,947 eligible participants reported having hypertension. Among them, 19.1% had no health insurance, 18.1% had no personal doctor, and 23.6% could not visit a doctor because of cost. Among those with hypertension by state, age-standardized prevalence of no health insurance ranged from 6.3% in Hawaii to 28.1% in Texas. The prevalence of those without a personal doctor ranged from 9.2% in Massachusetts to 32.7% in Nevada, and the prevalence of cost barrier to visiting a doctor ranged from 10.8% in North Dakota to 35.1% in Tennessee. By sociodemographic characteristics, the prevalence with no health insurance was highest among those aged 18-44 years (25.9%), Hispanics (28.1%), those with less than a high school education (32.8%), and those with a household income of less than $25,000 (31.6%).

       " 'Financial Services; WIN Home Inspection Franchise Partners With Bancorp for Car Leasing Program 2014 DEC 12 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Real Estate Weekly News -- WIN Home Inspection, America\\'s most advanced home inspection franchise, is helping franchise owners cut the cost of driving a new vehicle with an innovative partnership with The Bancorp, a major national financial service company and commercial lender.  WIN franchisees -- called Strategic-Partners -- can apply for a generous car leasing program offered by The Bancorp that can greatly decrease the amount of upfront cash it takes to open a home inspection franchise. This flexible funding option has no mileage restrictions or charges for wear and tear. It also may require no down payment.  Many participants enjoy a lower monthly payment, and the entire amount can be written off.  \"The Bancorp is a long-term partner who is here to serve not only the existing Strategic-Partner network, but also those brand-new franchisees directly out of their two-week training program,\" said Michael Combs, vice president of sales and marketing for The Bancorp.  \"Access to capital in today\\'s climate isn\\'t often easy, in particular for those with no business credit history. The Bancorp/WIN national fleet partnership is designed to let WIN Strategic-Partners focus on what they do best -- home inspections,\" he said.  While WIN Strategic-Partners focus on growing their businesses, The Bancorp will assist with vehicle purchases. It will also extend lines of credit to help fund the vehicle as well as the official WIN graphics, and in some cases even the WIN Startup Package and the WIN Marketing Package. The Bancorp also can help dispose of older vehicles that have reached the end of their useful lives.  The Bancorp can get the best price on vehicles by negotiating with manufacturers and sources. The partnership with WIN Home Inspection gives Strategic-Partners additional buying power as a group -- as a national system, WIN has more than 1,000 vehicles, Combs said.  \"This helps free up your existing working lines of capital to fuel your business, not the vehicles that need fuel themselves. We certainly help get the WIN Strategic-Partners on the road to success and are here to help with their transportation needs,\" he added.  WIN Strategic Partner Justin Kirkbride relies on his WIN vehicle to serve customers throughout his territory in Montana. Kirkbride\\'s vehicle gives him a clear advantage over competitors who make a poor impression by driving a beat-up old truck.  \"There was room for someone more branded, with a more professional feel.

       " '??Johnson Controls partners with UW on first-of-its-kind endowed chair, labs, in-house talent Johnson Controls Inc. will partner with the University of Wisconsin\\'s Madison and Milwaukee campuses in a first of its kind collaboration.  The multi-million dollar partnership builds on pre-existing investments in state-of-the art labs and research by creating an endowed professorship for Deyang Qu, a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Boston, and seeding Johnson Controls scientists in the campus labs. Qu will be the first Johnson Controls endowed professor in energy storage research, a collaborative appointment from the three institutions.  Qu characterized the level of direct partnership involved as the standout element - not just in the U.S., but worldwide.  \"I think the uniqueness of this collaboration is really the integration,\" he said. \"We basically integrate Johnson Controls as leading the industry of battery manufacturing globally and also the two campuses, the state universities - Milwaukee to Madison. I have seen lots of this industrial-university collaboration where they give the money and that\\'s about it.\"  It\\'s the kind of academic-industry collaboration interim UWM chancellor Mark Mone, and predecessor Mike Lovell, have held up as key to bolstering dwindling system funds and reaffirming the university\\'s role in the regional economy. From Johnson Controls\\' perspective, vice president of engineering and product development Mary Ann Wright said it\\'s the kind of solution the Glendale-based firm has been seeking to build its talent pipeline.  \"Anybody can make a gift to a university for an endowed chair or a lab, but what we did is we made an investment, and with an investment there\\'s a return you expect,\" she said.  In this case, that\\'s assistance addressing challenges around product development and developing a trained workforce. The hands-on approach teaches students while exposing them to the real world, Qu said.  Johnson Controls has already invested in two joint laboratories at UWM\\'s College of Engineering and Applied Science, including its \"dry pilot manufacturing\" lab, the only one of its kind on a North American university campus. The company also funded and installed the Johnson Controls Energy Storage Research Lab at the Wisconsin Energy Institute at UW-Madison, where researchers test, evaluate and optimize how battery systems perform and interact with a vehicle\\'s powertrain and electrical architecture.  Qu, who will be based out of UWM, envisions his role as a coordinator. As Wright puts it, he\\'s the \"glue\" binding the university and academic pieces, and ensuring everything progresses smoothly and bypasses the typical corporate and academic bureaucracy.  Mone said this helps realize his and Lovell\\'s collaborative ambitions.  \"It really steps up our game in a dramatic way,\" he said. \"This plays into one of our strengths, which plays into regional economic development.\"  Did you find this article useful?

The Comptroller also makes recommendations for the Texas Legislature to improve transparency in this area.  \"A college degree is a basic requirement for many jobs, and a benefit that provides real financial advantages throughout life,\" Combs said. \"That\\'s why it\\'s disturbing that the price of higher education seems to be climbing out of reach for many Texans. If college becomes possible only for the few, our young people and our nation will suffer for it. Our kids will find themselves squeezed out of their best chance for financial success, and America will miss out on the productivity and innovation of many of our best minds.\"  Student loan debt payments often take a large share of graduates\\' salaries. For Texas-educated college graduates under 30, the average loan-debt balance was $22,600, or 46 percent of average yearly earnings ($49,112) in 2011. In 2012, about 20 percent of student loan debt holders in Texas were more than 90 days delinquent on their debt. The most recent figures indicate that 14 percent of all federal student borrowers were in default within three years of leaving school, according to the U.S. Department of Education.  Financial experts say student loan debt could significantly reduce economic activity and demand for mortgage credit and negatively impact the broader economy by inhibiting entrepreneurship and the creation of small businesses.  The growth in student loan debt is mirrored by the growth in the cost of attending college. In Texas, average in-state public university tuition and fees rose by 90 percent between 2003 and 2012. Yet despite rising tuition costs and student loan burdens, enrollment in Texas degree-granting institutions rose 49 percent from 2000 to 2012.  Because college is usually a good return on investment - college graduates earn about twice as much as those without a college degree - this uptick in enrollment is expected to continue, making it imperative for students to know how their tuition and fees are spent, and to have better access to tools to help them get a full picture of college costs.  To help ensure the price of higher education remains in reach for Texas students, Combs makes several recommendations in the report.

       " \"News story: Scotland set for double inflation boost for State Pension MIL OSI -  Source: United Kingdom - Executive Government & Departments - Press Release/Statement:  Headline: News story: Scotland set for double inflation boost for State Pension  The basic State Pension is to rise by around double the rate of inflation, the UK government has confirmed, helping to give people increased financial security and peace of mind in retirement.  Thanks to the Coalition's 'Triple Lock' policy, all pensioners are to see a 2.5% increase from April next year. This will take the weekly payment up to £115.95, an increase of £2.85 per week.  This measure will help pensioners on lower incomes by pushing the guarantee up to £151.20 for single people from April 2015.  Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said:  This Government's introduction of the Triple Lock marked a profound shift in the way we support pensioners here in Scotland and across the wider UK. This ensured Scots have a secure income when they retire, an essential part of making sure we can build a fairer society.  Being part of the UK and the larger tax base, spreads the risk and provides greater certainty, security and a crucial safety net to help Scotland's pensioners. With an ageing population in our country we have challenges to meet in the decades ahead, those challenges are best met as part of the UK.  Pensions Minister Steve Webb said:  The Triple Lock is one of the defining policies of this government - a policy which rewards those who have worked hard and saved hard throughout their lives.  Thanks to the Triple Lock, in this Parliament the basic State Pension will be £560 per year more than if it had been just uprated by earnings. It's also the reason why the basic State Pension is now at its highest relative to average earnings that at any time since 1992.  With inflation remaining low by historic standards and the rise in average earnings at around 0.6%, under previous arrangements the basic State Pension may only have gone up by around 70p per week this year - the kind of insulting treatment of pensioners which we won't allow to happen.  The Coalition's 'Triple Lock' policy commits the government to an annual rise to the basic State Pension of whichever is highest out of the rise in inflation, the rise in average earnings, or 2.5%.  In line with the rise to the basic State Pension under the current system, the government has increased the illustrative start rate of the new State Pension which will be introduced from April 2016. This has also been increased by £2.85 to £151.25, in line with the government's policy that it will be set above the standard minimum guarantee. The actual start rate will be finalised in autumn 2015.  The cost of the measure to raise the standard minimum guarantee for Pension Credit will be offset by an increase in the Savings Credit threshold of 5.1%.\",\n",

Sunshine and surf are the island's two biggest commodities, and there's plenty of both to go round. Fuerteventura may be the second largest of the Canary Islands, but it gets only a fraction of the tourists seen by Tenerife and Gran Canaria. As a result, development is relatively low key, with some attractive boutique hotels opening in the past year. From 13 December, British Airways (ba.com) launches twice-weekly direct flights to the island, making it the perfect short, sharp cure for the winter blues.

       " 'Chinese President Xi Jinping and hundreds of Chinese investors travel Tasmania securing trade deals Tasmania has wrapped up an historic week in the international spot light.  The Chinese President, Xi Jinping, the highest-profile head of state to visit Tasmania, promoted the state\\'s economic potential to Asia and the world.  The President\\'s visit overshadowed the low-profile arrival of 275 Chinese delegates traversing the state in a bid to tie up economic partnerships.  Tasmania\\'s Department of State Growth showcased some of Tasmania\\'s brightest performers to delegates who represent the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, the Bank of China and investors from Fortune 500 companies.  Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman has signed 10 Memoranda of Understanding with the Chinese to maintain economic momentum and give exporters the opportunity to build bridges into lucrative Chinese markets.  Chairman of Ashgrove Cheese in northern Tasmania, Paul Bennett, says he doesn\\'t expect Ashgrove to be flying milk to China overnight, but he says he is excited about the value Chinese consumers put on Australian agriculture.  \"To see people really value the food, value the food for what it is,\" he said.  \"We\\'re used to Australian\\'s that expect milk everyday on their cornflakes and don\\'t think twice about it, but to see Chinese people treating it like precious wine, it\\'s really heartening to see people respect food so much.  \"There are certainly a lot of keen delegates, a lot of people with very impressive titles on their business cards and I guess we\\'ll see where it goes from there.\"  \"We\\'ve got the land and the cows and they\\'ve certainly got the people.\"  Mr Bennett points out that while international barriers to trade will be eliminated in the next decade, there are still significant domestic barriers to overcome.  The most significant being freight.  \"It should be easy to get product in but again it\\'s freight and issues like that, so they\\'re yet to be overcome.\"  Mr Bennett says the state will have to take a cooperative approach to exporting produce to ensure that products sent by sea or air are sent in quantities which achieve commodities of scale heading to China.  \"The logistics of that really have to be worked out on a state-wide basis because no one industry here is going to fill a plane or a boat. It\\'s going to need some coordination so that we can put a pallet of cheese or a pallet of milk on a plane with a pallet of honey and salmon, fresh meat and vegetables\".  With an emphasis on promoting dairy, horticulture, aquaculture and wine in a free trade deal with China, exporters say it\\'s a deal \\'tailor made\\' for Tasmania.  Visiting delegates agree.  Managing Director of Oriental Exports, Tom Zhu from Shanghai, says Chinese investors want exposure to brand Tasmania.  \"When I get back to China, a lot of the best restaurants, they must have Tasmanian produced products, so this means up market.\"',\n",
       " \"Globe Investor TSX cheaper than S&P 500 for the first time in five years sbarlow@globeandmail.com  Scott Barlow, Globe Investor's in-house market strategist, writes exclusively for our subscribers at ROB Insight and Inside the Market online. Subscribe to Globe Unlimited at globeandmail.com/globeunlimited.  The extreme levels of volatility in the domestic equity market weren't a lot of fun for anyone, but did have one positive outcome: The S&P/TSX composite benchmark is now more attractively valued than the S&P 500. This implies that the era of U.S. equity market outperformance may be at an end.  The week's chart verifies that the valuation differential between the Canadian and U.S. stocks matters for future performance. When the domestic benchmark has a price-earnings ratio below the S&P 500, the odds of TSX outperformance rise significantly.  The bar on the far left, for example, shows that when the P/E ratio of the S&P/TSX composite is between three and four times lower than that of the S&P 500 (meaning Canadian stocks are cheaper and more attractive), domestic stocks outperform U.S. equities by an average of 7 per cent in the following 12 months.  On the far right-hand side, the bar shows that when the S&P/ TSX P/E ratio is between five and six times higher than the S&P 500, domestic stocks underperform U.S. equities by an average of 8.7 per cent in the next year.  The Canadian market was more expensive than the U.S. market in terms of P/E from late 2009 until the end of October, 2014. The S&P/TSX composite is now 17.26, which is 0.6 (times earnings) more attractive than the S&P 500's 17.84.  According to the chart, when the S&P/TSX is cheaper by between zero and one times trailing earnings the domestic benchmark has still underperformed, but by a very small amount. In terms of valuation levels, Canadian and U.S. stocks are on roughly even footing as 2014 draws to a close.  It is important to note that, for the sake of simplicity, the chart does not adjust the performance data for currency changes - the S&P 500 returns were calculated in U.S dollars and the Canadian equity returns are in loonies.  It is certainly possible that a big move in the greenback versus the Canadian dollar could be a bigger factor in future performance than the relatively small difference in equity valuations. But currencies are notoriously difficult to predict and, while diversification is important, investment strategies based primarily on currency forecasts are prohibitively risky.  The current state of North American equity valuations implies that Canadian investors can be comfortable in selecting the best investment opportunities without worrying about which side of the border the stock trades.

Tens of thousands of San Mateo County residents will be able to join over three million people who now have affordable health coverage through California\\'s implementation of the Affordable Care Act and Covered California, the State\\'s health insurance marketplace.  An effective enrollment process is the first step to give people access to affordable health care. Over 52,000 County residents successfully signed up for health insurance during the 2014 enrollment period with over 24 in-person enrollment locations available to help. Local efforts in supporting these residents made San Mateo County Health System the highest enrollment government entity in the state.  The Health System estimates that more than 30,000 County residents still need affordable health coverage and may qualify for financial help.  Covered California selected San Mateo County Health System and four community partners to receive $300,000 in Navigator Grant Program funding. This funding will help to raise public awareness, motivate, and connect County residents to health coverage by providing additional in-person assistance through 62 Certified Enrollment Coordinators at eight locations across the County during business hours and some evenings and Saturdays. The grant funding will also help to provide cultural and linguistic support to meet the needs of the County\\'s population, and promote the \"no-wrong-door\" approach that provides a new seamless process using a single application to determine and enroll an individual in the most appropriate plan based on income and other criteria.  \"Our partnerships with trusted, community based organizations will help every uninsured resident gain access to quality, affordable health insurance,\" said Srija Srinivasan, San Mateo County Health System Director of Strategic Operations. \"Health insurance helps people stay healthy by covering preventive services such as flu shots and services to treat more chronic conditions such as diabetes. Everyone deserves the opportunity to be in good health and have peace of mind that they are financially covered when they may need it the most.\"  There are several deadlines for people to be aware of. The first is December 15, 2014, which is the enrollment deadline to begin coverage on January 1, 2015. December 15th is also the deadline to renew or change existing Covered California health insurance to maintain continuous coverage, as well as the deadline to avoid paying a tax penalty.  The deadline to enroll in Covered California health coverage in 2015 is February 15, 2015, which is also the deadline to apply for financial assistance.  \"Gaining health coverage helps not only the person enrolling, but also their family and the entire community,\" said Iliana Rodriguez, Director of San Mateo County\\'s Human Services Agency. \"Whether residents apply for health coverage during this enrollment period, or for Medi-Cal year-round, this is a vital opportunity.

       " 'Investing Second Cup outlines 3-year turnaround plan amid $26.2M loss TORONTO - Second Cup Ltd. had a $26.2 million loss in the third quarter, as the embattled specialty coffee company booked provisions for cafe closures and the impairment of its asset values.  The loss amounted to $2.65 per share, mostly due to a $25.7-million item that reflects the reduced value of Second Cup\\'s trademarks.  On an adjusted basis, Second Cup\\'s operations had a reduced profit of four cents per share - down about 64% from last year\\'s third quarter when adjusted earnings were 11 cents per share.  Second Cup also announced Monday that it plans to raise up to $5 million this month through a private placement of its stock, as part of a three-year plan to revitalize the Canadian specialty retailer\\'s network of cafes and its brand.  At the end of the third quarter there were 349 Second Cup cafes, two less than a year earlier and eight fewer than at the beginning of the quarter.  Systemwide sales for the 13 weeks ended Sept. 27 fell about $1.3 million from a year earlier, dropping to $43.6 million from $44.9 million, but Second Cup\\'s own revenue increased to nearly $6.7 million from just under $6.3 million.  Second Cup has been faced with increased competition in recent years from high-end coffee retailers such as Seattle-based Starbucks and major restaurant chains such as Tim Hortons and McDonald\\'s.  The Mississauga-based franchise company has been working for months to recover its position in the Canadian market, hiring Alix Box - who has held senior positions at Holt Renfrew and Starbucks - as its chief executive in February.  \"Fiscal 2014 has been a year of transition,\" Box said in a statement Monday. \"While much remains to be done, we are now fully engaged in the process of transformation to restore Second Cup to a place of leadership and greater profitability.\"  Following the end of the quarter, Second Cup announced its intention to acquire 16 cafes in Toronto locations from Debbie and Bob Riche, two long-time franchisees.  The company says it plans to open a new \"cafe of the future\" in Toronto and a flagship cafe in Montreal in the coming weeks.  In a related announcement Monday, the company said it\\'s aiming to grow annualized system sales by about $50 million to $234 million in 2017, turn same-store sales positive by late 2015, and have earnings exceeding 50 to 60 cents per share by 2017.  \"Our plan for the future is ambitious,\" said Michael Bregman, Second Cup\\'s chairman. \"While there are no assurances, our Board of Directors is highly confident that Second Cup will be restored to a position of leadership with significant potential for value creation.\"  All the directors intend to participate in a stock issue, and collectively acquire between 40 and 60% of the $5 million worth of equity that Second Cup plans to offer.',\n",

One in four over-65s are still to make a will [GETTY/ picture posed by model]  Research from the Co-operative Legal Services also found one in four over-65s are still to make a will.\\xa0  These individuals risk losing control of their estate and their final wishes for savings, assets and investments not being met.\\xa0  These findings come as the rules of intestacy, which decree what happens to a person\\'s estate if they die with no valid will in place, today change for the first time since 1925.  Experts say the new rules should simplify how an estate is distributed in the event someone dies without having the right paperwork in place but they also serve as a timely reminder of the importance of drawing up and maintaining a will.\\xa0  The key differences include changes for couples who are married or in a civil partnership. They will now inherit the entire estate if a partner dies without a will and they have no children or other descendants.\\xa0  However, this change does not apply to unmarried couples who will not automatically have rights to an estate if a partner dies without a will.\\xa0  Other moves include changes to the inheritance of an estate for married couples of civil partners with children and protection for children adopted after the death of a parent. Under old rules there was a risk children in this situation would lose their inheritance but under the new rules, a child of the deceased can inherit on intestacy even if they\\'re subsequently adopted.\\xa0  \"It\\'s pleasing that rule changes have simplified matters but if a person dies without a valid will in place, they still have no control over what happens to their estate,\" warns James Antoniou, head of wills for the CLS.\\xa0  \"To ensure your estate goes to those you want, it\\'s crucial you have a will.\" Andrew Caplen of the Law Society agrees that the rule changes serve as a reminder of the importance of a will.\\xa0  \"If you have no will it means your final wishes may go unheeded and a financial and emotional mess is left for your loved ones to sort out,\" he said.\\xa0  If you want to make a will it is worth noting that anyone can set themselves up as a will-writer.\\xa0  \"It is important that people are able to distinguish between those who are unregulated, uninsured and untrained and trained solicitors who specialise in this area,\" added Caplen.\\xa0  To find a registered solicitor that specialises in wills and probate visit Solicitors.LawSociety.org.uk.

       " \"News New report reveals older worker hotspots and the vast differences in employment prospects for over 50s around the country Watford, Dorset and the Shetland Islands are leading the charge against 'outdated' older worker stereotypes, a Government report revealed today.  According the figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions, Watford has the highest rate of employment among older workers, with nine out of 10 people aged 50-64 in work.  In the Shetlands this rate is 88 per cent while in north Dorset it's 87 per cent, closely followed by Stroud in Gloucestershire and Horsham in Sussex.  DWP minister Steve Webb said: 'The business case for ignoring outdated and inaccurate stereotypes and giving older workers a chance to thrive is absolutely compelling, and these figures  show that in some parts of the country that message is being received loud and clear.  'What we must do now is extend the positive record we're seeing in counties like Hertfordshire across the whole of the UK.'  But the report also highlighted a number of employment blackspots for older workers.  Almost half of people aged 50-64 were unemployed in Hyndburn and Rossendale in Lancashire, 50 per cent in London's Tower Hamlets, and 51 per cent in Barrow-in-Furness.  'JOB PROSPECTS FOR YOUNG ARE IMPROVING'  Two-thirds of employers have hired a young person in the past year, according to a survey of 600 employers.  The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said this positive outlook is set to continue for the rest of the year, with employers focussing more on candidate's attitude rather than exam results.  Rec chief executive Kevin Green said: 'It's the best time in six years to be a young person coming into the jobs market.'  This resonates with data released by the Office for National Statistics last week suggesting that ageism in the workplace is still rife.  Unemployment as a whole fell to 6.4 per cent last quarter and the number of unemployed people aged 16-49 fell 18.8 per cent since May 2010, compared to just 5.3 per cent for those aged 50-64.  Dr Ros Altmann, the former director general of Saga, who was appointed last month as the Government's Business Champion for Older Workers, said more needed to be done to help people in this age group, such as offering apprentice schemes.  'It does seem there remains latent ageism in the labour market,' she said. 'Not enough is being done to help these people back to work and overcome ageist attitudes.'  And with retirement at the age of 65 looking increasingly unfeasible for most workers, employment equality is essential if they're to top up their dwindling pension pot.  Steve Webb added: 'Another crucial point is that a person dropping out of the workforce early can have a devastating effect on their retirement income. We owe it to people to do everything possible to ensure they can benefit from a full working life.'\",\n",
       " 'Business Biggest earners the losers in super scramble IS the Government looking to scramble your superannuation nest egg? That\\'s one way of describing what could be on the cards for those wanting to build up very big super fund balances. Essentially, individuals would be able to build up their super fund to a certain size, and that\\'s it.  A low tax rate on contributions and zero tax on earnings in pension phase are the hallmarks of Australia\\'s superannuation system. But Treasurer Joe Hockey has made it very clear that any further superannuation tax breaks are not sustainable. And now the industry chatter is getting louder that the Government is looking to overhaul how much super an individual can put in.  Any major overhaul is years away. And the intended targets will be those who can afford to direct big amounts of capital into their super funds - the biggest earners.  This has since given rise to new ideas to restrict individuals from exploiting the favourable tax climate for superannuation, who build up massive super funds that they can use to generate huge tax-free income once they retire.  One such proposal is a six-point plan released by Taxpayers Australia, which believes reform of the system is inevitable. Its plan is: 1. INTRODUCE a lifetime concessional contribution limit a person of $600,000 - 20 years\\' of the current $30,000 a year allowable annual contributions.  2.INTRODUCE a non-concessional, contributions (NCC) lifetime limit of $1.8 million. Individuals can currently contribute up to $180,000 a year in taxed contributions.  3.ANY contributions over the $600,000 limit would be taxed at the top marginal tax rate and counted towards the $1.8 million NCC lifetime limit.  4.NCCs in excess of $1.8 million would be returned to the individual. 5.THE income of a pension fund with more than $1 million at the start of a financial year would be taxed at 15 per cent (currently zero), with a rebate on the first $15,000.  6. ACCUMULATION accounts with more than $2.5 million would be taxed (currently zero) at 30 per cent of income earned.  What this plan means is you would be limited to putting less than $2.5 million into your super fund over its lifetime.  \"Such proposals will ensure that people have an opportunity to grow their superannuation balance, but that the very wealthy cannot park their assets so as to have a tax-free retirement income stream,\" Taxpayers Australia head of superannuation, Reece Agland, said.  \"It will reduce the costs of the superannuation tax concessions to the very wealthy and discourage excess amounts of money being put into superannuation.\" But considerable research will be needed before any major changes to make sure there are no unintended victims. The Government will not want to end up with superannuation egg on its face.Tony Kaye is editor of Eureka Report. To read more by Tony Kaye and other experts, visit www.eurekareport.com.au',\n",
       " 'OnLine Financial adviser alert: Know your client and fit portfolio to needs MONTREAL - The estate and liability insurer of a deceased financial adviser have been ordered to jointly pay $112,589 to one of his former clients for failing to advise him properly in retirement.  Client Richard Racicot filed suit in Superior Court against the estate of Gerry Ouwendyk and his insurance company after the value of his portfolio - almost entirely invested in equity mutual funds - fell from $811,847 in June of 2007 to $483,930 in October of 2008.  Racicot said his portfolio was not properly structured to reflect his needs and investor profile during the financial crisis of 2008, and if he\\'d been given proper advice when he retired in 2006, would not have suffered the losses it did.  He asked the court for $847,917, an amount that included $328,000 in actual losses, inconvenience and lost future gains.  Ouwendyk, who died after legal action had commenced in September of 2012, maintained in a pre-trial examination that Racicot - a former real-estate agent and client since the mid-1970s - made all the investment decisions and was happy with the returns until the financial crisis.  He would not have suffered any losses if he\\'d followed his advice and maintained his investments instead of using most of what remained to buy an annuity in 2008, Ouwendyk argued.  Judge Stephen Hamilton disagreed.  \"In the same way we cannot hold Ouwendyk responsible for not predicting the crash, we cannot hold Racicot liable for not predicting the recovery. He acted reasonably in a very difficult situation.\"  Judge Hamilton said Ouwendyk had an obligation to be aware of his client\\'s needs, assets, objectives, investing knowledge and risk tolerance, even though their relationship predated the current financial-industry practice of requiring and regularly updating \"know-your-client\" (KYC) forms.  The fault was not in failing to complete a KYC form for Racicot, it was in failing to have required knowledge about the client, whether or not the form was completed, he said.  \"Retirement is a sufficiently important event in Racicot\\'s life to justify a review of his investment objectives,\" Judge Hamilton wrote.  \"Ouwendyk never had a detailed discussion with Racicot as to whether retirement had changed his investment objectives, needs and tolerance to risk. Ouwendyk simply assumed that nothing had changed and therefore kept essentially the same investment portfolio.\"  The judge conceded that analyzing the merits of a portfolio and how it may or may not have performed is something of a \"speculative exercise,\" but \"given all the evidence, I am satisfied that a portfolio that is more than 90 per cent invested in equity is not appropriate for a retired person.\"  He arrived at a final award of $112,589, roughly the amount of capital lost by not having half of Racicot\\'s portfolio in fixed-income vehicles from the time he retired in 2006.  pdelean@montrealgazette.com( mailto:pdelean@montrealgazette.com )  © Copyright (c) The Montreal Gazette',\n",
       " 'MONEY ADVICE \\'HELPS MOST CUT DEBT\\' Three-quarters of people who received debt advice funded by the Government-backed Money Advice Service managed to cut the amount they owed afterwards, research has found.  The MAS also said more than half (52%) of the clients surveyed who had taken up advice had a diagnosed mental health condition such as depression and, in general, many people have seen their overall wellbeing improve after getting help with their finances.  Around 88% of people who had face-to-face help from bodies the MAS gives debt advice funding to in England and Wales went on to take some sort of action afterwards to get back on track, such as setting up a household budget.  Meanwhile, 76% of more than 1,300 people surveyed said they reduced or cleared at least some of their debts within three to six months of receiving advice. One in 16 (6%) paid off their debts in full.  The most common types of debt people had before seeking advice were rent and mortgage arrears, as well as utility bills and credit card debt. Around half (52%) of clients had multiple types of bills or payments they were concerned about.  Four-fifths (80%) of clients surveyed across the board said they felt more in control of their situation after getting advice, while seven in 10 (71%) felt less stressed and two-thirds (67%) reported they were sleeping better.  The MAS is an independent body set up by Government to offer people across the UK free money tips and help to manage their budgets.  Caroline Siarkiewicz, head of the UK debt advice programme at the MAS, said: \"These figures provide further evidence that debt advice really does work.  \"If anyone is struggling to pay their bills or feels stressed about their financial situation, they should seek advice immediately. Advice can help you get on top of your debts, and feel better about managing your money.  \"Debt advice can be sought at any time. To help you find where to get high quality advice, use the Money Advice Service\\'s debt locator at moneyadviceservice.org.uk/debt.\"  Last year, the Service funded debt advice in England and Wales provided by Citizens Advice, Bristol Debt Advice Centre (now known as Talking Money), Capitalise London, Community Finance Solutions, East Midlands Money Advice and the Greater Merseyside Money Advice Project.  Independent research into what clients did after receiving advice took place between November last year and January this year.  Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"People are falling into a debt trap as the gap between rising bills and stagnant incomes hits household budgets.  \"Free, impartial debt advice can stop money problems from spiralling and put people back in control, so it\\'s more important than ever that people know where to turn.  \"These figures show the impact that good quality debt advice can have.

       " 'Sport Morts is grateful to ditch utility bill LOYALTY might be dead to rugby league, but decency still has a faint pulse that enabled Daniel Mortimer to accept an NRL lifeline from Gold Coast in June.  Although the utility was stranded in NSW Cup at the Roosters, coach Trent Robinson did not want to release him with the contract not due to expire until the end of next year. And it wasn\\'t just Mortimer\\'s versatility that deterred Robinson, who had also prevented the 23-year-old from joining the Titans when he arrived at Bondi in late 2012.  \"It was also hard because Morts is a great man and I had come to see him as a friend,\" Robinson said. \"I now really enjoy watching him play where he always wanted to play - in the halves.\" It\\'s unlikely Robinson will derive much enjoyment should Mortimer star against his former club at Allianz Stadium tonight, in John Cartwright\\'s last match in charge of the Titans.  \"We asked him to stay (at the end of 2012) and he played out of position and did a really great job for us,\" Robinson said. \"We couldn\\'t stand in his way a second time. He did us the honour, so we owed it to him to do the honourable thing in return.\" Mortimer extended his stay at Bondi for a further two seasons midway through 2013, knowing that he was behind Mitchell Pearce, James Maloney and Jake Friend in the playmakers\\' pecking order. He was content to trade ambition for security, but received less opportunities when Pearce and Maloney were overlooked for Origin duty and Friend evolved into an 80-minute hooker.  \"Getting 15 or 20 minutes here and there - I was not fully satisfied,\" Mortimer said. \"I think the club could see I was hungry for more.  \"Then I was playing NSW Cup, so things weren\\'t going perfectly to plan and then (Pearce and Maloney) didn\\'t make Origin, so there were no opportunities to play halves. I started talking to the Titans in March about possibly moving next season, but then they got some injuries and wanted me straight away in June.  \"It all happened in a couple of days.  \"People like Robbo and (Roosters chairman) Nick Politis are men of their word and that\\'s why they are so well respected. The last thing Nick said to me before I left was, \\'You\\'ll be back here some day\\'.\" The irony of tonight\\'s showdown is that Mortimer would have been an automatic selection for the Roosters, with Friend (hamstring) sidelined for four weeks. It\\'s the first time Robinson has been forced to prepare without his No.9, whose absence will test the Roosters\\' ruck defence against Gold Coast\\'s light stepping forward pack.\"I can\\'t actually remember the last time the halves or hooker was injured for the Roosters,\" Mortimer said. \"And that\\'s probably one of the reasons I\\'m with the Titans now.\"',\n",
       " 'IRS Issues Final Regulations On Longevity Annuities With the goal of providing retirees with more options to manage their retirement income, the IRS issued final regulations on \"qualified longevity annuity contracts\" (QLACs). A QLAC is a type of deferred annuity that commences at an advanced age and continues for the life of the retiree.  A QLAC can be offered under a defined contribution plan such as a 401(k), 403(b), and 457(b) plan, or other employer-sponsored individual account plans, as well as IRAs (except\\xa0 Roth IRAs). This rule allows retirees to spend a portion of their retirement savings on a lifetime income stream, while retaining other assets in readily accessible investments.  Here is an overview of the rules:  the maximum amount of retirement savings that can be used to purchase a QLAC is the lesser of 25% of the account balance or $125,000, adjusted in increments of $10,000 for cost-of-living increases;  any amount used to purchase a QLAC will not be included in the amount used to calculate the retiree\\'s minimum required distribution;  a QLAC can have a return-of-premium feature that guarantees that all premiums are recouped from the annuity carrier if the retiree dies before receiving annuity payments equal to the full amount of premiums paid - the excess is payable to a beneficiary (this type of annuity may be a little more expensive but appeals to individuals who want to provide a benefit to their heirs should they die before the entire premium amount is paid out to them);  distributions under a QLAC must begin no later than age 85;  the final regulations stipulate that the QLAC cannot be a variable annuity contract, an indexed contract or a similar contract; and  the annuity contract must state that it is intended to be a QLAC at the time of issue.  These regulations apply to contracts purchased on or after July 2, 2014.  So who would use a QLAC? Employees concerned that they might outlive the IRS minimum required distribution (MRD) table should consider this new option. Let\\'s assume an employee retires with a large 401(k) balance. MRDs are required when an employee reaches age 70½. At age 70, the employee purchases a QLAC with $125,000 of the account balance. The QLAC is to begin payment at age 85. The employee has removed the $125,000 from the MRD rules and created a guaranteed income at age 85 of between $32,500 and $52,500 a year (depending on insurance company assumptions).

       " 'FSCS \\'expects\\' more IFA failures from SIPP investigations The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) said it expects the number of advisory businesses declared in default as a result of its investigations into self-invested personal pension (SIPP) advice to rise above the current four.  The scheme said it is receiving increasing numbers of claims against independent advisers who are no longer trading, where advice was given to transfer existing pension schemes to SIPPs.  In many cases the SIPP fund was then invested in non-standard asset classes, many of which have become illiquid.  Four advisory businesses have so far been declared in default by the scheme following its investigations into SIPP claims, including Harlequin distributor TailorMade Independent, and it expects to begin processing claims against them in September.  In an update issued on 29 July, the scheme said it \"expects to see further similar failures going forward\".  Warning  In April, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) felt compelled to alert firms to its requirements on SIPP advice after encountering poor practice in the market.  The regulator\\'s position is that pension transfers or switches to SIPPs intended to hold non-mainstream propositions are \"unlikely\" to be suitable for most retail customers.  Where an adviser recommends a SIPP knowing the customer will switch from a current pension arrangement to release funds to invest through a SIPP, then the \"suitability of the underlying investment must form part of the advice\", the regulator declared.  However, FCA investigations found many advice firms restricted their assessment of the suitability of a SIPP to the merits of the wrapper.  <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Read: Are unregulated investments ever a good idea? <  The FSCS said its experience of SIPP claims is consistent with the findings of the FCA earlier this year.  It has been investigating the SIPP claims it has received to establish if the failed IFAs involved are liable. It said it expects to be in a position to start processing claims in September.  The Financial Ombudsman Service has also reported a spike in complaints related to SIPP advice.  Eligibility  The FSCS said, in order to establish whether a claimant is eligible for compensation, \"we will consider the advice given by the advising firm\".  Determining losses suffered by investors is likely to be complex, it added, in particular where the claims involve both pensions and investment advice, and where some of the assets are difficult to value.  To pay compensation, the FSCS said it will need to be satisfied the firm in default can be held legally liable for the losses suffered by the claimant, as opposed to, for example, another party such as a separate firm involved in the transaction or a party that caused an investment to fail.  \"We may consider making interim payments of compensation where we are not yet able to account for all elements of a claimant\\'s loss,\" it said.  <h3 style=\"text-align: center;\"> Read: FCA bans advisers for pushing 2,000 clients into \\'unsuitable SIPPs\\' <  To view photo, click here.',\n",
       " 'Spend & Save Donald MacInnes: By George, a princely survey has driven me to distraction Being as I have always been honest about my status as a sort of placebo wordsmith - giving the impression of having genuine journalistic acumen without actually having any quantifiable justification for doing so - one might imagine that few people within the serious media world would give me the time of day. Not so.  Now and again I receive press releases from actual public relations professionals who, frankly, should know better. Despite the fact that I have stressed that I have little understanding of, and even less interest in, the labyrinthine machinations of domestic and international fiscal affairs, I still get emails from pension providers or management consultancies, alerting me to their hot news and expecting me to do something about it. I stare at their information for what seems like hours, blankly mouthing the first few words, before turning back to YouTube to look at videos of monkeys in people clothes.  However, this week I received an email which was far more offensive than any previous assumption of my business nous. Sadly, this email assumed that I would be interested in - and, like my Pulitzer Prize-winning hero, Dave Barry of the Miami Herald, I swear I am not making this up - \"the Top 50 Reasons Why We All Love Prince George\".  The sender of the email, who I shall call Emily, described a poll to which apparently many people had responded, giving their own reasons for appreciating the pampered princeling. Allow me to quote from the astonishing missive: \"Many respondents adored his cuteness, identifying things like his smile and chubby cheeks. Others appeared to be more nostalgic, claiming that they loved him because his gran was the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Others gave more obscure reasons with some saying that they adored him because his other gran used to be a flight attendant. One woman who took part in the survey said: \\'I absolutely adore Prince George, everything from his smile to his sense of fashion and one day he will be King.\\' One mum added: \\'He looks just like the perfect baby, he\\'s got those big blue eyes and such a cheeky smile.\\'\"  My colleague (who is from Merseyside and therefore not unfamiliar with feelings of dislike towards anyone from south of Ellesmere Port) described this communication as \"the worst thing I have ever read. Ever. Really, ever.\"  I would tend to agree with him and not just because I find the Royal Family as appealing as an underdone fried egg garnished with a twitching wasp. It\\'s not just what they represent, but what their existence does to people like poor Emily, with her 50 reasons. This makes me regard Emily in a rather pitying manner.

       " \"News Half a billion pounds in inheritance tax gifted to taxman because life insurance policyholders fail to use trusts More than half a billion pounds are being handed over every year in inheritance tax from life insurance policies because people aren't placing them in tax-efficient trusts.  Taking out life insurance within a trust makes the policy exempt from IHT when you die as it places it outside of your estate, yet very few policyholders use trusts.  Adviser website Unbiased estimates that because of this some £530million will be paid out needlessly in IHT this year on life insurance policies. That is inflated in part by soaring house prices that have seen thousands more households breach the £325,000 IHT threshold on estates.  Karen Barrett, of Unbiased, said: 'Many of us want to pass on our estate to loved ones after we're gone but what people don't realise is the sizeable tax bill we might also be handing over in the process.  'As the housing market continues to boom and the IHT threshold remains static, this leaves many more of us at risk of passing on an unnecessary tax bill.  'Planning ahead can mean your beneficiaries don't pay more tax than they need to as there are many strategies for reducing an inheritance tax bill including wills, pensions, trusts and other tax advice.'  Some life insurance customers may not need to put their policies into trust, because they may be designed to pay off a mortgage, for example, or the money will go to a spouse which makes it exempt from IHT.  But those looking to leave a legacy to their children or other loved ones could instead land them with a tax bill if their life insurance policy is included within their estate.  As well as the tax exemption, policies left in trust will pay out a lot quicker than going through the probate process, with cash handed over within weeks, rather than months.  It also protects people named as beneficiaries in the trust in the event the policy-holder divorces and marries again.  But why are so many people failing to take advantage of trusts? Well, Minesh Patel, of EA Financial Solutions, said a lot of this is down to apathy or ignorance.  He said: 'I would suggest that ignorance is one reason, particularly when the product is not purchased through financial planners.  'Sometimes there are also difficulties in knowing who to appoint as trustees, and apathy may come into play when they consider the time it takes to get signatures from trustees and witnesses.  'But the benefits are considerable and financial planners are best placed to guide their clients through the process.  'In the case of married couples and civil partnerships if your assets exceed £650,000 in the current tax year on death your beneficiaries will pay 40 per cent inheritance tax on the amount by which it is exceeded.'

       " 'Business; Front Page Treasury to set out radical changes to UK\\'s £12bn annuities market THE TREASURY is to set out details of the biggest changes to the pensions industry in more than a century tomorrow, firing the starting pistol on a rapid legislative programme designed to give savers greater choice.  David Gauke, the new financial secretary to the Treasury, is to publish a major consultation on the future of the pensions market, entitled Freedom and Choice in Pensions. The document is aimed at setting out the Treasury\\'s detailed thinking on how the new pensions system will operate.  The paper will call time on the UK\\'s annuity market, which is worth £12bn a year, and set out plans to allow prospective pensioners flexibility in what they do with their pension pot on retirement. The publication of the document will kick-start a series of formal industry consultations, ahead of the changes that come into effect from April next year.  Central to those changes is the need for all prospective pensioners to be offered advice as to what sort of pension product to opt for. The Treasury will commit itself to offering face-to-face advice to those who request it, but the majority of advice will be over the telephone or via a centralised website.  The changes were introduced by George Osborne, the Chancellor, in his Budget speech in March, in which he pledged to end the annuity market.  Mr Osborne said he felt, along with many critics of annuities, that buyers were being short-changed and given little value for money.  However, the news caught investors unawares, with some £4.4bn being slashed from the value of insurance companies in afternoon trading after the Budget.  Mr Gauke will set out the details tomorrow, emphasising that the Government is committed to encouraging greater innovation in the pensions market.  A significant part of the consultation will be devoted to encouraging insurance and pensions providers to develop new products to allow pensioners income in their retirement, but offer greater freedom than has traditionally been the case.  Alongside this, HM Revenue and Customs will outline changes to the tax rules that govern the selling of products.  The pension changes mean retirees will be able to take lump sums from lifetime annuities at specific points, and allow varying levels of income over time from an annuity. The proposals will also include, for the first time, changes that will allow family members to receive some of an annuity should the policyholder die.  The announcement is likely to be scrutinised by the industry, both in terms of content and timing.  Major insurers have raised their concerns on timing with the Treasury ahead of the announcement, warning that promising face-to-face advice meetings to all could slow the process.  Shortly after the Budget, the Association of British Insurers cautiously welcomed the plans. Otto Thoresen, the director general, said they \"represented a significant challenge for everyone involved in helping people to secure their retirement income\".  Comment: B2',\n",

Retirement may be even more expensive than you thinkRetirement investors need to save more than conventional wisdom calls for to meet their basic income needs during their golden years, according to Richard C. Marston of the University of Pennsylvania. In fact, the often-cited estimate eight times current earnings may be far too low, he says. Instead, retirement savings should be about 15 times more than the current salary for clients to have adequate nest eggs, says Marston, author of \"Investing for a Lifetime.\" Retirees\\' spending behavior can be expected to be very similar to their pre-retirement years, the expert explains. \\xa0\\xa0--New York Times  Are you paying too much for long-term care?Nearly 70% of Americans are in need of long-term care insurance during their golden years, while 20% will need more than five years of long-term care, according to Motley Fool. However, the lack of market competition results in high LTC premiums, decreasing many people\\'s desire for such coverage. The article comes with a slideshow that will help clients manage premium costs effectively.

       " 'Search Summary  Shire, AbbVie Met to Discuss Takeover Proposal -- Update  504 words 12 July 2014 06:25 AM Dow Jones Institutional News DJDN English Copyright © 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.         By Jonathan D. Rockoff   Pharmaceutical company Shire PLC met with rival AbbVie Inc. earlier this week to discuss the terms of AbbVie\\'s $51 billion takeover proposal, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The companies met after AbbVie raised its cash-and-stock proposal, and the discussions aimed to help Shire understand the ins and outs of the latest offer, according to the person.  The talks weren\\'t intended to trigger negotiations, and Shire didn\\'t commit to further discussions, the person said, though further talks could follow. The person didn\\'t know if any subsequent meetings were planned.  Bloomberg first reported talks were held. Shire, of Dublin, Ireland, issued a statement on Friday confirming the meeting with AbbVie, but didn\\'t elaborate. AbbVie declined to comment.  AbbVie, a Chicago-area pharmaceutical company with an $88 billion market capitalization, makes the world\\'s top-selling drug, Humira. The company has made four proposals to buy Shire.  AbbVie has said it would seek to reincorporate in the U.K. after it bought Shire, a so-called inversion that several American companies have sought in recent months to lower their tax rates.  Shire has been cool to AbbVie\\'s pursuit, saying the proposals undervalued Shire and didn\\'t account for the risks in securing a tie-up. Chief Executive Flemming Ornskov said a takeover could disrupt the company\\'s pivot toward drugs for rare diseases and its recent double-digit growth in profits and earnings per share.  \"This is not driven by industrial, medical or research logic. This must be driven by financial and tax thinking,\" Dr. Ornskov said in a recent interview.  But analysts said the terms of AbbVie\\'s latest proposal would be hard for Shire to reject out of hand. Two top-20 Shire investors have told The Wall Street Journal that they would like Shire to engage in talks with AbbVie, whose most recent proposal promised a 48% premium to Shire\\'s share price the day before AbbVie made its first bid in early May.  AbbVie was spun off from Abbott Laboratories in early 2013. It is trying to develop drugs for hepatitis C and other diseases to diversify beyond rheumatoid-arthritis therapy Humira. Humira accounts for more than half of the company\\'s revenue, but it is scheduled to lose patent protections starting in 2016.  Shire is best known for the drug Vyvanse, its top-selling product, which treats attention-deficit disorder. The company has been shifting focus toward rarer diseases, such as an enzyme disorder called Hunter Syndrome treated by the company\\'s Elaprase therapy.  Since taking Shire\\'s helm last year, Dr. Ornskov has done six acquisitions to build the company\\'s rare-disease capabilities, and its market capitalization has more than doubled to $49 billion.  --Peter Loftus and Hester Plumridge contributed to this article  Write to Jonathan D.

       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING Report points to new Fed policing tool; CAPITAL MARKETS The Federal Reserve could better police the shadow banking system by using a new financial tool created to help it wind down emergency monetary easing, says a new US government report.  The central bank has been testing a so-called reverse repo programme that will see it lend out securities from its vast portfolio of assets to money market funds. This enables the Fed to drain money from the financial system and better control short-term interest rates.  It also means that the central bank is playing a much larger role in a key shadow banking market, which it could use to better govern this opaque area of the financial system. The report from the Office of Financial Research, part of the US Treasury, suggests that the Fed could leverage the RRP to better control non-bank financial intermediaries and prevent market booms and busts.  In particular, it said, the Fed could set minimum haircuts - charges for trades - on its RRPs, a move that would resemble the reserve requirements imposed on banks to help implement monetary policy. Raising or lowering the haircuts would act like a lever that could influence the behaviour of money market funds in the repo market.  \"Minimum haircut requirements could become the equivalents of minimum capital requirements for the backing of shadow money claims, and could give the Federal Reserve macroprudential control over market-based credit cycles - a control it did not have pre-crisis,\" Zoltan Pozar, senior adviser at the OFR, said in the paper.  According to the paper\\'s definition of shadow banking, which is capital markets activities that are funded through short-term money markets, the size of the sector has fallen from a peak of $8tn in 2008 to $5tn at the end of last year.  Mr Pozar wrote some of the first research on shadow banking but his definition of the market is considerably narrower than the one used by many others. The Financial Stability Board estimates that the shadow banking system, which it defines as non-bank lending, has increased 21 per cent since the financial crisis to $71tn of assets.  The OFR report says that the growth of shadow banks before 2008 may have been due to large global imbalances leading risk-averse cash managers to seek out money-like assets being created in the recesses of the financial system.  Chief among these were the repo market transactions provided by big dealer-banks which saw them pawn their assets in exchange for short-term loans from lenders including money market funds, insurers and mutual funds.  The repo market became ground zero for the financial crisis after these lenders sharply reduced their financing to large banks.  \"One way to interpret the phenomenon of shadow banking is as the financial economy reflection of real economy imbalances such as excess savings, slowing potential growth, and the rising share of corporate profits relative to wages in GDP,\" Mr Pozar said.',\n",

During early U.S. trade, the Dow 30 slipped 0.15%, the S&P 500 fell 0.25%, while the NASDAQ Composite edged down 0.18%.  The U.S. Department of Labor said the number of individuals filing for initial jobless benefits in the week ending June 21 declined by 2,000 to 312,000 from the previous week\\'s revised total of 314,000.  Analysts had expected jobless claims to fall by 4,000 to 310,000 last week.  A separate report showed that U.S. personal spending rose 0.2% last month, below expectations for an increase of 0.4%. Personal spending for April was revised to a flat reading from a previously reported decline of 0.1%.  The data came a day after the Commerce Department said U.S. gross domestic product contracted at an annual rate of 2.9% in the first three months of the year, compared to the consensus forecast for a decline of 1.7%.  General Motors (NYSE:GM) declined 0.62% following reports the automaker may need to fix its top-selling Chevrolet Cruze for a new type of air-bag problem.  The news came as the company has already recalled a record number of vehicles in the U.S. this year due to defaults linked to at least 13 deaths.  Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) added to losses, down 2.71%, as the tobacco company lowered its annual earnings projection.

       " 'Bang On Homes Home ownership out of reach for many young people \\\\ construction industry: New home affordability remains a prime concern This week\\'s topic is the first in a series concerning issues affecting the residential construction industry across Canada.  Bard Golightly, president of the Canadian Home Builders\\' Association, recently said in his inaugural address: \"For nearly three quarters of a century, CHBA has brought together home builders, renovators, community developers and those who work with us, in common purpose -- to ensure we can continue to provide Canadians with the best housing in the world.  \"The evidence of our success can be seen in the neighbourhoods that make up every city and town across our country and in the pride of millions of Canadians who live in homes built by CHBA members.\"  The association has held to its core principles since its founding in 1943: Affordability and choice in housing where communities provide a wide range of housing options suited to all those who want to live and work there; and that Canadians who work hard should have a reasonable opportunity to own a home.  New home affordability remains a prime concern among the members of the association.  Home ownership has long been an integral part of the Canadian dream and one of the major building blocks towards financial security.  Unfortunately this important milestone is becoming an unattainable goal for many young people.  Government-imposed costs, particularly at the municipal and provincial level, threaten the dream of home ownership for many Canadians.  Overall taxation on new home buyers can amount to more than 20% of the purchase price in some regions. This factor is pushing the possibility of home ownership out of reach for many young people. In the case of constantly increasing development charges, that amount is subject to HST -- in effect a tax on a tax.  Between 2005 and 2011, the average house price in Canada increased by 58% while the average income of millennials (25-to 34-year-olds) increased by a mere 6%.  As new home prices rise, inevitably the resale market prices also rise. The average house price in Canada in 2011 was $422,000, which translates to more than six times the average yearly income of a millennial. The World Bank classifies this 6:1 ratio as \"severely unaffordable.\"  There\\'s some positive news for those looking to enter the housing market. The New Building Canada Plan is a federal government initiative to invest in core municipal infrastructure. If these funds are invested properly at the municipal level, municipalities should be less dependent on development charges, thereby helping to reduce the taxation of new homes.  There are several ways to help potential first-time home buyers. Those who are well qualified should have access to longer mortgage amortization periods (30 years) and current federal first-time homebuyer assistance programs should be indexed so young people and families continue to have the opportunity to own a home.  Ted Melchers is president of the London Home Builders\\' Association',\n",
       " 'Smart Money Dreams of cracking the UK market Donna Burton is looking to take her range of nut products to London.  At her Saturday market stall in suburban Sydney, Donna Burton is selling her macadamia nut products and dreaming big.  Ever since living in London for about two years in the mid-1990s, she has had an ambition to join the list of suppliers to that city\\'s venerable grocery store, Fortnum & Mason.  Her Jelbonleigh macadamias could provide the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  After launching with one product 15 years ago, Burton has built a small but premium, award-winning business and, since January, has been in conversation with Fortnum and has her fingers tightly crossed for a business breakthrough. Once she cracks that market, she says she\\'ll have a go at Harrods.  Jelbonleigh supplies retail-packed plain and flavoured macadamia nuts, broken nut pieces for cooking and macadamia nut butter and oil. Prices range from $9 for a 100-gram pack to $30 for a half-kilogram. The nut butter is $13 for a 330-gram jar, $33 for 1.3-kilogram jar and the oil from $12 to $20 a\\xa0bottle.  Burton says her business will grow gradually as bigger, traditional grocery stores tap into the trend for stocking health foods, including more nut products.  \"These supplies are becoming more mainstream as people become more conscious of where food is grown, how it is harvested and packaged, and more aware of the health benefits of nut butters and oils.\"  Burton calls Sydney\\'s Royal Agricultural Society Easter Show her saviour.  Since 2006, Jelbonleigh has won multiple RAS fine food and regional awards, which have given her brand credibility, increased market confidence among buyers and, importantly, opened the door to her coveted markets across Australia and in Britain.  Nuts are sourced from growers in northern NSW for between $14 and $17 a kilogram. Six tonnes might yield about a tonne of finished product. As her volumes grow, Burton says she has access to further suppliers.  Burton pays Stahmann Farms about $7000 per processed tonne of product; labelling is supplied by AC Labels in Sydney, for about $2000 a year. Stahmann Farms is the premier sheller of Australian tree nuts (walnuts, macadamias and almonds) and is described as a leading processor and marketer of Australian macadamias.  Burton\\'s point of difference is that she sources her own macadamia nuts from farmers and they are all-Australian \"from paddock to plate\". \"No one else\\'s nuts are mixed with mine and the macadamias are processed in a peanut-free facility.\"  Revenues are on the rise, Burton says, but not enough for her to give up her full-time day job as a teacher with Life Education\\'s \"Healthy Harold\" initiative, launched by Ted Noffs in Sydney in the mid-1970s to educate young people about healthy, drug-free and alcohol-free living. Burton trained as an art teacher in Tasmania, is divorced and has two children, aged 22 and 21.',\n",
       " 'Stocks boost U.S. public pensions despite accounting reform -study WASHINGTON, June 10 (Reuters) - A rising stock market will cause most U.S. public pensions to achieve healthy funding levels this year, even as they adapt to an overhaul on accounting for investments, according to a survey from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College released on Tuesday.  Up until this year, almost all public pensions \"smoothed\" their assets\\' values across a short span of years. That meant the losses they suffered in 2008 from the financial crisis, pummeling their biggest source of revenue - returns on equities - affected their funding levels through 2013. Last year, the 150 plans Boston College surveyed had enough assets in total to cover 72 percent of their liabilities, the same as 2012. The ratio first dipped below 80 percent, considered the threshold for a financially healthy plan, in 2009.  The Governmental Accounting Standards Board has ended the process of smoothing starting this year. Under the old methods, plans\\' funded status would have likely risen to 75.2 percent as the losses from the crisis finally fell out of the calculations, and then probably climbed 77.4 percent the following year.  Under the new standards taking effect this month, though, many plans will appear to be in even better shape. Recent gains in the stock market will register at once, bringing the baseline funded ratio up to 80.6 percent in 2014 and possibly 81.6 percent in 2015, the survey found, projecting the investments\\' performance using the Dow Jones Wilshire 500 Index.  Public pensions ended 2013 with the highest assets on record, according to the U.S. Census.  \"Regardless of the measurement standard, a continued healthy stock market will improve the funding picture in 2014. What happens thereafter depends very much on the performance of the stock market and the extent to which plans adjust their discount rates,\" according to the survey.  There is a hitch. If a public pension is deemed \"underfunded,\" it will have to reduce its projected rate of return to one GASB considers \"riskless.\" When applying this rate to all the sample pensions, Boston estimated the funded ratio would be 69.5 percent this year and 70.4 percent next.  Last week, the Federal Reserve reported public pensions had a funding gap of $1.372 trillion in the first quarter. With benefit entitlements totaling $5.034 trillion, pensions were 72.7 percent funded. Just a year earlier, in the first quarter of 2013, pensions were only 69 percent funded, according to the Federal Reserve data.  Still, each state has a unique retirement system for public employees and the plans\\' financial health can vary greatly. For fiscal 2013, which for most public pensions ended June 30, 2013, 6 percent of the plans surveyed had enough assets to cover more than 100 percent of their liabilities and 27 percent of plans could cover 80 percent to 99 percent, Boston College found.

       " 'Tax Expert Financial Post Take caution when adjusting tax return In the midst of spring cleaning you discover a folder containing a bunch of medical receipts from last year that you neglected to include in the total medical expenses you claimed when you filed your 2013 tax return.  Compounding the problem is the fact that this year, you filed early and have already received your Notice of Assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency approving your refund which was deposited into your bank in March.  The good news is that correcting or adjusting your tax return is a relatively straightforward proposition that does not involve actually having to redo and resubmit a corrected or amended tax return.  Instead, all you need to do to make a change to your return is to go online and select the \"Change my return\" option on the \"My Account\" section of the CRA website. If you prefer paper instead, you can send a completed Form T1-ADJ \"T1 Adjustment Request\" or even just a signed letter, along with supporting receipts or documents, to your tax centre requesting that the necessary adjustment be made.  A recent court case, however, serves as a caution for taxpayers who may be tempted to abuse this relatively simple adjustment process. The case involved a taxpayer who submitted T1 adjustment requests for the 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 tax years claiming what turned out to be fictitious expenses sufficient to generate a total refund of more than $200,000, which was the total of the tax withheld at source in those years.  The CRA was rightly suspicious of the taxpayer\\'s adjustment requests and not only denied them outright but assessed gross negligence penalties totaling over $75,000 for knowingly making a \"false statement in filing a return, form, certificate or answer relating to a taxation year.\"  The taxpayer went to court in an attempt to get penalties cancelled on the grounds that despite falsifying the expenses, his action was due to \"stress related to financial difficulties, marriage breakdown and the loss of access to his business books and records.\"  The taxpayer\\'s lawyer also put forth several legal arguments as to why the penalties should be cancelled including the fact that no refund nor notice of reassessment was ever generated by the CRA as a result of the \"fictitious requests\" and therefore the taxpayer didn\\'t actually \"benefit\" from filing the fraudulent forms.  The judge dismissed each of the taxpayer\\'s arguments in turn and concluded that the taxpayer \"needed cash (and that) the filing of these fictitious requests would be a convenient and quick solution and would otherwise...be carried out with impunity.\"  So before filing your adjustment request, be sure you\\'ve got the supporting documentation to back it up or risk not only having your request denied but being hit with a penalty to boot.

       " 'What Do Chinese Home Buyers Want? -- WSJ Blog-2- When searching for real estate, well-heeled Chinese consumers are buying properties as investments and for future generations, with many spending between $1 million and $3 million on the latter purchases.  That\\'s what Sotheby\\'s International Realty found in a recent survey of affluent real-estate consumers in China, the U.S., U.K. and Brazil. Though the sample size was quite small in certain countries, with only 102 people interviewed in China, it showed that most high-net worth consumers recognize the critical role real estate plays in building wealth, noted Philip White, CEO of Sotheby\\'s International Realty Affiliates.  Seeing homes appreciate in value is a main driver for wealthy Chinese home buyers, with 99% of respondents saying a return on investment was important, compared with 89% of U.S. survey takers. At the same time, China\\'s property slowdown appears to be taking its toll, as only 63% of Chinese respondents felt more confident in the strength of their housing market compared to five years ago, while 77% of respondents in the U.K. and 76% of respondents in Brazil noted an upswing in their housing markets.  But buying a home for future generations remains a priority for the Chinese, with 93% of respondents saying they\\'re likely to make such a purchase, compared to only 64% in the U.S.  The survey, which took place in late January and early February, sheds light onto the growing group of Chinese buyers that real-estate markets across the world are increasingly trying to cater to. \"Over the last five years the Chinese interest has grown, and we expect this to continue in years to come,\" notes Michael Pallier, managing director of Sydney Sotheby\\'s International Realty in Australia.  For a more granular perspective on where the Chinese are looking, Shanghai-based real-estate portal Juwai.com, which features worldwide property listings for Chinese home buyers, recently collected data on where consumers in tier-1 and tier-2 cities are searching for homes abroad. In Shanghai and Guangzhou, both tier-1 cities, top country searches included the U.S. and Australia. In tier-2 cities such as Chengdu, Kunming and Harbin, top destinations included Spain, Germany and France.  \"Consumers in tier-2 cities are more adventurous than their tier-1 compatriots,\" says Juwai.com co-founder Andrew Taylor. \"They seem to be leading the charge into the furthest-flung international real-estate markets.\"  There\\'s still one place in China, though, where home buyers aren\\'t favoring one country over another: Hong Kong.

       " 'News First growths best place for gains as recovery in wine market widely anticipated MATURE vintages dating back to the 1990s from top Bordeaux estates are among wines offering the best opportunities for gains after a three-year market slump, according to a manager at The Wine Investment Fund.  While Bordeaux from recent years including 2008 and 2009 has continued to drop in price over this year, clarets from 1995 have held their value better as stocks are being drunk down, Investment Manager Chris Smith said in an interview.  \"The mature vintages are where the real opportunities are,\" Mr Smith said.  \"If you\\'re anticipating a recovery, as we are, I think first growths are probably the place to be.\"  The Liv-ex 100 Index of benchmark wines, predominantly from Bordeaux and including producers from areas such as Burgundy, the Rhone, Champagne and Italy, has dropped for 13 straight months, bringing its decline since the end of March last year to 12pc.  Waning Chinese demand combined with a run of three difficult vintages in Bordeaux following the highly priced 2009s and 2010s has hurt investor appetite for wines from the region.  Mr Smith said that first growths \"tend to overperform on the way up and underperform on the way down, so they\\'re slightly more volatile than the rest of the market.\"  First growths from the left bank of the Gironde estuary, reflecting a list drawn up for Napoleon III\\'s Paris exhibition of 1855, include Chateau Lafite Rothschild, Chateau Latour, Chateau Margaux and Chateau Haut-Brion. A fifth estate, Chateau Mouton Rothschild, was added in 1973.  A case of Latour 1995 sold for £3,750 (?4,451) on Liv-ex on May 22, little changed from the £3,800 (?4,510) at which a similar case changed hands in December 2012, according to Liv-ex data. A case of Latour 2008 sold for £3,600 (?4,273) on the exchange on May 7, down 18pc from £4,400 (?5,223) in December 2012.  \"The market now is well below the trend line,\" Mr Smith said, following annual declines in the Liv-ex 100 of 15pc in 2011, 9pc in 2012, 1pc last year and 4pc so far this year.  Muted demand for the latest Bordeaux vintage has been reflected in lower volume on the Liv-ex market.  \"In April last year, the new 2012 vintage accounted for 16pc of Bordeaux trade by value,\" Liv-ex said in its monthly Cellar Watch market report.  Mr Smith said that sterling strength had played a part in pushing wine prices lower, because of the UK\\'s pivotal role in the global secondary market for wines. The pound was trading at $1.67 yesterday in London compared with $1.51 in May last year, while against the euro it climbed to ?1.23 from ?1.17 over a similar period.  \"The fall in the wine indices really closely mirrors the rise in sterling,\" Mr Smith said. \"This is a real sticking point for wine.\" (Bloomberg)',\n",
       " 'Money Rates threat to negative gearing Insight  As the typical house price rises, so does the number of debt-laden landlords. That\\'s the message from recent figures showing that it\\'s investors, rather than owner-occupiers, who are driving the house price surge.  A recent survey published by Roy Morgan said the number of people using borrowed money to invest in bricks and mortar had surged by 37 per cent between 2010 and March this year to 1.31 million. In comparison, there was a much smaller 4 per cent rise in the number of borrowers who lived in their homes.  In dollar terms, the value of lending to property investors is growing at 7.9 per cent a year, compared with 4.9 per cent for owner-occupiers. And as this week\\'s graphic shows, taking out an investment property loan has become more popular for people aged anywhere between 25 and 64.  There\\'s nothing remarkable about using borrowed money to invest. But Australia\\'s army of landlords stand out because so many are paying more in interest and other costs than they collect in rent - \"negative gearing\".  Property investors chalked up a whopping $7.8 billion loss of income in 2011-12, the latest year for which official figures are available. While other costs such as water bills and council rates all contributed to this loss, the biggest factor by far was interest payments. Property investors\\' annual interest bill was $24 billion, which wiped out more than 70 per cent of all gross rent collected.  Why are so many people prepared to make a loss on their investments? They believe capital gains will outweigh the short-term loss. Tax breaks also sweeten the deal.  So, just how likely are these capital gains?  Recently property prices have boomed in many cities, especially in Sydney. But Reserve Bank official Luci Ellis this month gave property speculators sensible advice: don\\'t expect that rises of the past will necessarily be repeated.  Most economists agree the surge in property in the 1990s and early 2000s was influenced by a permanent shift to lower interest rates, made possible by a move to much lower inflation. The transition to cheaper credit allowed people to borrow more, and bid up the price of property. But as Ellis said, \"that transition is over now\".  In the last couple of years, interest rates have fallen further still, and once again this has helped to boost property prices. But none of the experts believe credit can remain this cheap.  Interest rates will eventually rise, probably by the middle of next year. When this happens, people making losses on their investment properties are likely to make an even bigger loss because their interest payments will rise.  They will be hoping for big capital gains, of course. But when it was cheap credit that helped push prices higher in the first place, juicy capital gains could be harder to come by when rates are heading up.',\n",
       " 'Govt supercharges debate over retirement Lifting the age at which retirees can get their superannuation seems inevitable.  The Abbott government is under siege from Labor, the Australian Greens and welfare groups over its budget decision to lift the pension age to 70 in 2035 and change pension indexation.  Superannuation is also in the spotlight after Treasurer Joe Hockey raised the prospect of a rise in the age at which super can be accessed, known as the preservation age.  Treasury boss Martin Parkinson added fuel to that fire on Tuesday when he told a business lunch in Sydney that change to the preservation age - which for those born after June 30, 1964 is 60 - was inevitable.  \"I think it is inevitable that pressure will build for changes in that area,\" Dr Parkinson said.  \"We have to get a bit more sensible about the way we talk about and think about retirement incomes.\"  The overall issue of retirement and the ability of people to work until they are 70 needed to be broadly discussed.  \"(We) need to start to think more seriously about how people manage different careers throughout their life and how we manage the transition - we can\\'t realistically expect a bricklayer to become a brain surgeon.\"  Mr Hockey indicated on the ABC\\'s Q&A program on Monday the government could change the age at which people can access their retirement savings.  \"It is on my mind, and it\\'s on Tony Abbott\\'s mind,\" Mr Hockey told the program, saying the issue of retirement savings could be addressed in this term rather than later.  But Prime Minister Tony Abbott said on Tuesday the government would fulfil its election promise not to make any adverse changes to superannuation in its first term.  \"A period of stability in respect of super is right and proper,\" the prime minister said.  Mr Hockey later backed up Mr Abbott.  \"My personal view doesn\\'t matter in this particular point,\" he said.  \"What matters is the policy of government - we\\'re not changing super in this term of government.\"  The government expects the latest Intergenerational Report - the first since January 2010 - to drive the debate when it\\'s released at the end of 2014.  \"(It will) look at the long term, even the very long-term challenges associated with things such as government expenditure or how do we fund our retirement savings,\" Mr Hockey said.  The Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia believes the preservation age should be set at least five years lower than the age pension eligibility age.  Industry Super Australia says raising the preservation age should only be looked at after other steps are examined, such as improving consumer protections.  Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said Mr Hockey should keep his hands off superannuation.  \"In a breathtaking act of arrogance he says this super may be your money, but now I\\'m going to make you wait longer to get your own money,\" Mr Shorten said.',\n",
       " \"Investing Will the Footsie crash before breaking its record? Shares hover near 6,930 high but experts warn on overvalued markets The world's top stock markets are overvalued and prices look 'vulnerable', a survey of investment managers warns.  They have sounded the alarm as London's FTSE 100 hovers tantalisingly close to its all-time high of 6,930, while on Wall Street the Dow Jones and S&P 500 continue to rack up fresh records.  Some 49 per cent of money experts surveyed by industry body CFA UK think developed world markets are overvalued - up from 39 per cent three months ago. Just 16 per cent of the 500-plus professional investors who responded view these markets as undervalued at present, against 22 per cent last time.  The poll of influential finance industry players will stoke fears that current elevated stock valuations are unsustainable, and investors are exposed to the danger of a market correction or at worst a crash.  The FTSE 100 reached a 14-year high of 6,894.90 last week, putting the UK's leading stock index within touching distance of its previous record notched up in December 1999 and the key 7,000 mark.  The CFA results, shown in detail below, reveal that the attitude towards emerging market stocks is little changed. Some 57 per cent of those surveyed regard them as undervalued now, compared with 59 per cent three months ago.  Emerging markets have taken a battering since the US Federal Reserve began scaling back its vast stimulus programme in December.  The central bank's operations were intended to support the US recovery, but they also generated plentiful cheap cash which boosted stocks and other assets around the world. The Fed's policy change means this money is now flooding back out again.  However, the CFA notes a shift in opinion on government bonds and gold over the past quarter. The proportion of investing experts who believe these traditional safe haven assets are overvalued has dwindled - from 76 per cent to 71 per cent in the case of bonds, and from 46 per cent to 36 per cent with regards to gold.  Investors dumped gold in 2013 as the world economic outlook improved and the Fed signalled its intention to end stimulus efforts. The gold price has stablised this year at around $1,300.  Will Goodhart, chief executive of CFA UK, said investment professionals had changed their views over the past quarter on three of the five asset classes covered in its research (see below).  'Expectations that central banks may delay interest rate rises, given recent economic data and an increasingly benign inflation outlook, appear to be encouraging some investment professionals to reconsider the relative value of debt and and equity investments,' he said.  'With both the FTSE and S&P indices hovering around record highs, our data suggests that investors should perhaps be cautious about reaching for yield in developed market equities when investment professionals view that yield premium as vulnerable.'\",\n",
       " 'Nordic Region Pensions & Investment News: Country Focus: Sweden - Employee contribution boost key to Swedish pensions conundrum. Sweden\\'s pensions system could be radically improved by encouraging employees to increase their level of contributions into employer sponsored plans, according to a report by Mercer.  This could be done by simplifying regulations that currently only allow extra contributions above the tax deductible threshold if this is stated by collective agreement signed by trade unions and companies.  David Knox, partner at Mercer, says: \"This would make the process more effective for individuals wishing to save more.\"  In Sweden, the employer has tax deductibility of up to 30 per cent of its income, says Mikael Nyman, a Swedish pensions expert. This is normally regulated at a collective agreement level.  \"There is always a possibility to make extra contributions, if the employer and employee agree upon it. Contribution to second pillar pensions are paid totally by the employer, which, however, can top up its pensions contributions with money from employees\\' salaries,\" he says.  Sweden fared third best in the latest Melbourne Mercer Global Pensions Index (MMGPI), which classified 14 retirement systems from all continents excluding Africa, according to adequacy, sustainability and integrity. Based on these categories, it built three sub-indices and then blended them into the MMGPI.  The Netherlands scored the highest, followed by Switzerland and Sweden. Together with Australia and Canada, the countries made it to grade B, which, according to Mercer, means they have \"a system that has a sound structure, with many good features, but has some areas for improvement\".  Mercer also recommended that Sweden raise its retirement age, as other countries have done, to reflect increased life expectancy.  Currently, Swedes can start collecting their state pension from age 61, but may work until age 67 if they wish. The government is planning to increase this limit to 69, according to Mr Nyman.  \"It would be most beneficial for the country if people had a longer working life, starting earlier and working longer,\" he adds.  However, Mercer\\'s Mr Knox says Sweden would climb up the MMGPI more quickly if it introduced arrangements to protect the pensions interests of both parties in a divorce. Under existing rules, occupational pensions provided by employers are excluded from the division of assets when a married couple splits up.  He says: \"The largest impact on the scores would be caused by reviewing the divorce rules, followed by encouraging member contributions and indicating an increase in the state pension age by 2030.\"  Mercer also recommended that Sweden improves its requirements in respect of annual information to members of all pension plans.  In brief  The Netherlands scored the highest in the latest Melbourne Mercer Global Pensions Index, followed by Switzerland and Sweden.  Sweden could improve its rating by encouraging employee contributions into employer sponsored plans. Mercer also recommended that Sweden reviews its pensions policy in the case of a divorce, and that it improves its requirements in respect of annual information to members of all pension plans.  111090731',\n",
       " 'IRI Partners with HealthView for Care Planning The Insured Retirement Institute (IRI) and HealthView Services developed a health care cost assessment program that helps financial advisers prepare clients for long-term health care spending needs.  Through the partnership, the IRI offers its member firms access to HealthView Prime, a retirement health care cost planning tool customized for financial advisers. The tool is designed to facilitate the integration of retirement health care cost considerations into retirement planning decisions.  \"Incorporating future health care costs into Americans\\' retirement plans is essential to helping them financially prepare for their later years,\" explains Cathy Weatherford, IRI president and chief executive officer. \"Until recently, advisers weren\\'t always able to provide retirement health care data for individual clients, creating a retirement health care cost planning gap.\"  The individualized retirement health care cost data that HealthView Prime provides will be a powerful tool to help advisers drive informed retirement planning decisions, she adds.  According to HealthView Service\\'s recently launched Retirement Health Care Cost Index, an average healthy couple retiring next year will spend 69% of their total lifetime Social Security benefits, or $366,599 in today\\'s dollars, on health care in retirement. In another 10 years, costs will rise to 98% of total lifetime Social Security benefits, or $421,083.  For couples retiring in 20 years, as much as 127% of Social Security benefits will be required to cover health care costs, and couples retiring in 32 years will need 190% of their Social Security benefits to cover health care costs, barring substantial reforms to the federal safety net program (see \"Health Care Costs Will Exceed Social Security Benefits\" ).  \"Retirement health care costs are the elephant in the room when it comes to retirement planning,\" says Ron Mastrogiovanni, founder and CEO of HealthView Services. \"Driven by health care cost inflation, the elephant will only get bigger and crowd out other issues.\"  Using HealthView Prime, advisers affiliated with IRI member companies will be able to quickly calculate expected health care costs for individual clients. The data is a starting point for conversations about retirement savings and decumulation strategies that optimize Social Security payouts and other key factors to a successful retirement. The data can also help individuals decide when to retire and whether moving to a new state is a viable option, the firms say.  Drawing upon cost data from more than 50 million annual health care cases, HealthView Prime uses the actuary- and physician-reviewed methodology to determine average longevity and expected retirement health care costs based on age, gender, health, and time to retirement.  Under the terms of the partnership, IRI member companies will have the opportunity to sign up for HealthView Prime and will be charged based on adviser usage. In addition to HealthView Prime, HealthView Services\\' offers IRI members HealthWealthLink, an integrated retirement planning tool that assists financial advisers in preparing personalized estimates of retirement health care costs.

It\\'s the biggest obstacle facing Christina Chaise, a 24-year-old graduate student at Columbia\\'s Teachers College, in her journey from poverty to self-sufficiency. Brown and Chaise are typical young college graduates in New York - they have student loan debt that will probably affect their choices for decades. \"It scares me,\" said Chaise who owes $20,000 but expects to borrow at least another $20,000 before finishing graduate school. \"I have been pursuing higher education to raise myself out of poverty,\" she said. \"I grew up in the projects. There\\'s nothing wrong with that, but I want a better life.  I don\\'t know if I can do everything I want to do because I have these bills to pay each month.\" Brown, a 25-year-old project coordinator with the New York Public Interest Research Group, had to take out extra loans after her father had a stroke while she was in college. She said she thinks about her $30,000 in debt whenever she considers any life choice. \"It\\'s impacting my decision whether I want to continue my career,\" she said. Millions of Americans are in the same boat as these New Yorkers. Americans owe $1.2 trillion in student loan debt, a number that has tripled in the last decade. New York State residents hold $60 billion of that debt, and college grads in the state owe on average $27,310 in student loans, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Student loans have passed credit cards and auto loans to become the second-biggest source of personal debt in the U.S., trailing only mortgages. Aware of growing public concern over the issue, Senate Democrats are making student loans one of their top election-year planks. They plan a vote in June on legislation offered by Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren that would allow holders of public and private student loans to refinance at lower rates, just as people can refinance home mortgages or car loans. Brown, who pays an interest rate of 6.8%, could benefit if the bill became law by cutting her interest in half.  \"This high amount of student debt is dragging down our economy,\" said Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), who sponsored a provision in the loan legislation. Republicans are sure to balk at a provision in the bill that pays for the lost federal revenue from government loans by raising income taxes on those who earn more than $1 million a year. But Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Republicans will face stiff political pressure to compromise. \"This issue has amazing resonance,\" Schumer said. dfriedman@ nydailynews.com  Caption: Tiffany Brown (left) and Christina Chaise owe thousands in student debt.',\n",

       " 'Financial Post Investing Canadian stocks projected to gain strength Canadian financial stocks could bounce back this year after spending most of 2014 trailing other sectors.  The S&P/TSX Capped Financial index has returned only 2.7% this year, while the S&P/TSX Composite index is up 7.2%.  But analysts said the lag in financials might only be temporary, especially as a number of factors could conspire to boost earnings and help fuel further multiple expansion in the sector.  \"We believe life insurance and asset managers stand to benefit from a moderate uptrend in yields, equity gains, and a return to \\'risk-on\\' leadership,\" said Vincent Delisle, an analyst at Scotiabank.  This year\\'s disappointing performance by the financials is in contrast to the sector\\'s 12.3% gain in 2013. Last year\\'s rally defied market skeptics who took part in the so-called Great White Short, which involved betting against Canada\\'s banks on the idea that heavily indebted Canadian consumers and an overheated housing market would bite into earnings.  Many of Canada\\'s banks instead went on to post record profits, raising their dividends in the process.  But Mr. Delisle is still more bullish on Canada\\'s asset managers and life insurers than he is on banks, for which he has a market weight recommendation overall. Nevertheless, he has overweight recommendations for Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and National Bank of Canada.  For asset managers and insurers, Mr. Delisle has overweight recommendations for CI Financial, IGM Financial, Manulife Financial, Sun Life Financial and Intact Financial. Analysts have been bullish on Canadian financials because of the prospect of multiple expansion this year, but more are seeing the potential for higher interest rates to also start positively affecting the space.  Current expectations are for the Bank of Canada and U.S. Federal Reserve to hike rates next year. The higher rates are seen as especially beneficial for Canada\\'s life insurance companies, but banks could also benefit.  Michael Goldberg, analyst at Desjardins Capital Markets, said this week that higher short-term interest rates could fuel margin expansion at Canada\\'s banks, helping to add 20% to earnings by fiscal year 2017.  Of course, Canada\\'s financial sector still faces a number of potential headwinds.  Analysts at Canaccord Genuity, which initiated equity coverage of Canada\\'s banks  last week, said the housing market and heavily indebted consumers still pose risks to the financial sector.  \"The major risk we see for the sector is a turn in the credit cycle, a recurring theme due to Canada\\'s slower economic growth and concerns over a housing bubble,\" the analysts said.  The analysts do not view that as a \"high probability\" event as long as the Canadian economy grows at approximately 2.5% annually, something they say is supportive of job creation. The Bank of Canada forecasts the economy will grow by 2.3% this year, followed by 2.5% next year.',\n",
       " \"Estate planning and firearms in Western Australia: why Annie might not get your gun When you pass away, gifting specific items to beneficiaries is usually a straightforward task for your executor. However, there are some items that you may not be able to gift automatically. You may need to take proactive steps prior to your death if you wish for them to be dealt with according to your Will.  Under Western Australian law, a licence is required to own a firearm. Upon the death of a licensed firearm holder, an executor should hand in firearms into a local police station or alternatively to a licensed firearms dealer for safe custody, regardless of whether the firearms are collectors' items or are actively used. This is because a firearms licence expires on the death of the licensee.  If firearms are handed to a licensed firearms dealer, the executor should inform police of their name and contact details, the details of the deceased licence holder, and the deceased's firearm licence number. The executor should also advise police what is to happen to the firearms, such as if they are to be disposed of, sold, or gifted under a Will.  If you intend to gift your firearms in your Will, you can take some steps to assist your executor in attempting to transfer the firearms to your beneficiaries.  Your executor could be co-licensed for each of the firearms. This will allow your executor to retain the firearms upon your death while administering your estate, rather than having to hand them to police or a firearms dealer. If the executor is co-licensed and retains the firearms, he or she must inform police of the whereabouts of the firearms.  To be licensed, an executor must have a genuine reason why they need a firearm. Being an executor under a Will is not considered a genuine reason, and in general, it can be difficult to meet the required test of obtain a firearm licence. Accordingly, you may wish to choose an executor who can display a genuine reason or currently holds a firearm licence.  Regardless of whether the executor is able to be co-licensed, the beneficiaries are ultimately the intended owners of the firearms and will therefore be required to be licensed. If they are unable to obtain a licence, they will not be able to take ownership of your intended firearm gifts. Accordingly, when specifying a gift of firearms, you may wish to consider if your beneficiary is currently, or is likely to be, licensed.  The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

       " 'Metro Weather to blame for yo-yo water bill \\\\ Meters often not reachable If you\\'ve noticed a big fluctuation lately in your bill from the Evansville Water & Sewer Utility, you aren\\'t alone. Oppressive winter weather meant utility crews were unable to reach numerous meters and water usage amounts were estimated for those customers, said Allen Mounts, director of the utility. Differences will be applied now that the weather has cleared and crews are able to see the meters again.  \"There were literally thousands of meters we couldn\\'t reach,\" Mounts said. \"When the adjustments happened in March and carried into April, it resulted in some having zero usage because we had overestimated from prior billing. That\\'s causing the fluctuation month to month until we get back into actual readings.\"  The utility often has situations when a meter or transmitter won\\'t function properly due to a mechanical issue, but Mounts said weather has been the main culprit recently in topsy-turvy bill patterns.  Customers have called the utility in recent weeks to complain about being over-billed for water usage. On the Courier & Press Facebook page Monday, several people said the same thing, with bills showing amounts far exceeding the norm.  Some commenters were skeptical that their payments would even out this spring.  Mounts on Monday vowed that they will, and the utility lately has sent some bills that reflect zero water usage.  \"It all levels out based on what the actual readings are. It will reduce the amount,\" he said.  However, even bills with zero water usage carry a charge. Mounts said all utility bills have a fixed charge for the meter and a varying charge based on the amount of water used. That means customers always will have a charge, even if water use is zero.  \"It\\'s explainable, but it\\'s not something (customers) would normally think about because we don\\'t carve it out on the bill,\" Mounts said. \"It\\'s not on the bill, and it gets more obvious when people see zero usage.\"  Mounts said the utility is often asked why readers can\\'t remember where meters are, even when the meters are obscured by snow.  He said there simply are too many of them for a worker to remember the exact location of each one.  Technology the utility is implementing over the next 18 months or so is aimed at improving the meter-reading process. Evansville is replacing all its water meters - about 60,000 - over the next 18 months as part of a contract with Johnson Controls Inc. Those new meters will be read electronically and transmit data in real time.  Mounts said it would take an extreme winter weather event to knock those meters or transmitters offline, and even then, \"we wouldn\\'t have to send out another crew. The system will start transmitting again (when the weather clears).\"  The new system, Mounts said, \"will help tremendously.\"',\n",
       " \"NH Local appeals body would be a pricey alternative to OMB; $1.75-million cost would need property tax funding The Ontario Municipal Board - better known as the OMB - doesn't get enough credit for the key role it plays in the development approval process.  The board provides an impartial, independent tribunal that is responsible for handling appeals of land-use planning disputes. It is removed from local political pressures and renders decisions in the broader public interest based on sound planning principles.  BILD fully supports the role of the board as an evidence-based body. According to the City of Toronto, only 4 per cent of all land-use applications go to the OMB. We believe it does a good job in handling those disputes.  This is an important issue now because the city is considering how to create a local appeal body, with locally appointed officials handling disputes. Our industry feels that shouldn't occur until municipalities have some operational experience.  In a letter to the city, BILD has recommended that it does not proceed with the appeal body because it would cost too much and could involve conflicts of interest.  City staff estimate that creating the appeal panel would cost $1.75 million a year, and that some of the costs would be paid through property taxes. To recover all expenses at this new appeal level under consideration, , it would cost about $6,000 per appeal application. It currently costs $125 to file an appeal to the OMB.  The OMB works - so why try to replace it? This is one of the arguments BILD made in submissions to the province during its public consultations into the Development Charges Act and the Land Use Planning and Appeals System.  So what does this mean for you?  Today, many of the OMB's decisions have resulted in celebrated projects across Toronto. These success stories include the Distillery Historic District, 18 Yorkville, One Bedford and The Kings (King and Parliament, and King and Spadina). Without the OMB, these five developments would not be what they are today. They have contributed to Toronto's profile as a world-class city.  Contrary to the strong media perception that the OMB most often sides with developers, independent research by a leading Canadian expert and author on public policy, Aaron A. Moore, found that the OMB most often favours municipal planners as they are considered to have greater autonomy than their private-sector counterparts.  It is an important planning principle to build complete communities. To do that, a land owner interested in participating has to research and study what the neighbourhood's past, present and future.  But as a model for handling appeals of land-use planning disputes, we think the OMB works just fine.  Bryan Tuckey is president and CEO of the Building Industry and Land Development Association.

       " 'New York Modern Dance Company in Search of a Space to Call Its Own; Hope Greenfield Donates $500,000 to Rioult Dance NY Hope Greenfield believes in permanent homes.  With a gift of $500,000, Ms. Greenfield, 62 years old, is helping Rioult Dance NY find a long-term home in New York City. The small, modern dance company is looking for room to grow and to raise its profile among the city\\'s arts enthusiasts.  \"We really want to serve the community,\" said Ms. Greenfield. \"And you can\\'t really do it without a home.\"  A permanent space for the 20-year-old New York-based dance company is important both in terms of identity and building patronage, said Ms. Greenfield, who resides in Califon, N.J. A former managing director at Lehman Brothers, she retired in 2008, the same year she became chairwoman of Rioult\\'s board of directors.  A new home would also allow the company to realize its vision of a companion school for students ranging in age from toddlers to adults. Such an academy would help to foster \"both the ability in young dancers and an appreciation of dance for future audiences,\" said Ms. Greenfield.  Rioult Dance NY presents the works of French dancer and choreographer Pascal Rioult. The company started in the apartment of Mr. Rioult and his wife, Joyce Herring, the company\\'s associate artistic director. Both are former members of the Martha Graham Dance Company.  The Rioult company operates on about $1 million annually. Currently, it practices \"all over,\" said Ms. Greenfield. \"We\\'re nomads.\"  The company was close to signing on a space a few months ago, but the deal fell through. An ideal space includes room for open rehearsals so that patrons can sit in and see works as they are developed, something Ms. Greenfield said she enjoys.  Ms. Greenfield first became interested in Mr. Rioult\\'s work after seeing a performance in the late 1990s. She loved the unique choreography and the use of music. The intimacy of the performances also hooked Ms. Greenfield. She joined the organization\\'s board in 2003.  The gift of $500,000 brings Ms. Greenfield\\'s giving to the group since 2005 to almost $1 million. Her donations channel through the Gordon and Harriet Greenfield Foundation, a family foundation started by Ms. Greenfield\\'s parents, who both died in 2005.  Ms. Greenfield\\'s parents enjoyed music and were significant benefactors to the Manhattan School of Music, where a hall is named for the couple. The late Mr. Greenfield, an entrepreneur, was in the teleprompter business. Ms. Greenfield said she spent a summer during college typing daytime soap-opera scripts for her dad\\'s business.  The most recent gift to Rioult, along with a $225,000 gift to the Manhattan School of Music, helped to liquidate the assets from the foundation, which is now closed. Ms. Greenfield and her brother decided to dissolve it as a way to make \"meaningful\" contributions to several organizations, she said.',\n",
       " 'News Home inspections offer unbiased report of property With the spring real estate market on our doorstep, and a home purchase representing the biggest investment most of us will make during our lifetime, it\\'s important to obtain a home inspection as part of the buy-sell process. Whether you are a seller, a buyer or a real estate agent, enlisting the services of a qualified home inspector is imperative to a solid transaction.  Yet according to Rob Parker, a Londonbased Registered Home Inspector (RHI) with the Ontario Association of Home Inspectors (OAHI), less than half of those involved in buying and selling a home hire a home inspector.  Parker, also a member of the American Association of Home Inspectors (ASHI), and a Certified Master Inspector (CMI), said while it is important to involve a home inspector when a home changes hands, it is even more important that you hire a properly trained home inspector.  \"The best route to take is to visit the OAHI website (which lists) registered home inspectors,\" said Parker. \"You have to do 250 inspections, and have your reports checked, to become a RHI.\"  Parker said currently, there is no law against anyone setting up shop as a home inspector. And while Ontario Bill PR158 was passed in 1994, giving the OAHI the right to set educational requirements and standards of practice, it cannot stop anyone from advertising themselves as a home inspector, even if they have no related education or professional experience.  The Ontario Ministry of Consumer Services, through a panel of industry experts, has produced a new report entitled, A Closer Look: Qualifying Ontario\\'s Home Inspectors. It identifies five crucial elements aimed at bettering the home inspection industry, while concurrently protecting the home buyer. The report recommends the implementation of uniform qualifications and standards, as well as mandatory insurance cover-a ge for all Ontario-based home inspectors.  Regulation of and technical standards for home inspectors, professional home inspector qualifications, consumer protection requirements plus regulatory governance for the province\\'s home inspection industry are all identified as key areas needed to better the climate of home inspections in Ontario.  However, Parker said the panel has suggested that \"no specific mandatory requirements to become a licensed home inspector should be required.\"  The ministry will collect public comments on the recommendations until January 27, 2015.  Parker said there are a myriad of advantages to the seller, home buyer and real estate agent when enlisting a qualified home inspector. For example, a seller can be made aware of problems ahead of time, allowing the seller time to repair a home and shop for competitive contractors. As well, a home buyer may benefit when it comes to acquiring financing. In addition, a real estate agent benefits from a third-party, unbiased report which can be made available to potential buyers.  Parker said caveat emptor: always hire a home inspector who carries Errors and Omissions insurance. After all, even a home inspector can make a mistake.',\n",
       " \"UK Budget 2014: a watershed moment for pensions and savings This is a win-win Budget for savings, pensions and the economy. The breathtaking announcement of vastly improved flexibility and tax breaks for those who set money aside for their future is a clear statement of political intent. The message is that the government does believe in the value of saving and wants to trust people who have put money into pensions to manage their money for themselves in retirement, with far fewer rules and restrictions.  When it comes to Isas, people will be allowed - at long last - to choose how much to save in cash and how much to put into stocks and shares, or even peer-to-peer lending. They will be able to switch freely between assets as suits them best.  And as for pensions, from now on we will no longer have the most inflexible pension system in the world. ?The beauty of the additional freedoms to take more money out of accumulated pension funds as cash is that it will not only be popular with the public, it will also bring in extra tax revenue in the near term.  Current restrictions usually lead to people with smaller pension funds buying poor-value annuities. But George Osborne, the chancellor of the exchequer, will now allow anyone with less than £30,000 worth of total pension savings to take the money in cash (up from the current £18,000 limit); while the restriction that allows only two small pension pots of up to £2,000 each to be taken as cash is to be turned into an allowance of up to three funds of less than £10,000 each to be cashed in - and still a quarter can be taken tax free.  Those who might still want to buy an annuity - and there will be some who wish to - will receive face-to-face advice to help them understand the risks before making an irreversible purchase?. This will shock annuity companies but they have only themselves to blame. Following the review by the Financial Conduct Authority, the City watchdog, I suspect that there have been fears over a new mis-selling scandal - of which I have long warned - as millions of pensioners buy poor-value annuities without receiving any risk warnings.  And even flexible drawdown is becoming more flexible. Those who do not want to buy annuities and put money into drawdown will need only £12,000 of pension income, rather than £20,000, to be allowed unrestricted access to their funds.  Then, next year, the punitive ?55 per cent tax rate will go and there will be even more flexibility.  The verdict on this Budget is that it marks a watershed moment for savings and pensions in the UK but we must be careful that industry lobbying does not undo the good intentions. Tories will love it and - oh, yes - there's an election coming up.  The writer is a former adviser to the Treasury on pensions\",\n",
       " 'MONEY 5 tips for boosting savings If you are woefully behind on saving for retirement, then try to delay gratification on purchases, save your raises and pay off credit cards, financial experts say.  A national survey released Tuesday shows that about 36% of workers have less than $1,000 in savings and investments that could be used for retirement, not counting their primary residence or defined-benefit plans such as traditional pensions.  Many retirees are also short on funds, with 29% having less than $1,000 in savings and investments, according to a telephone survey of 1,000 workers and 501 retirees from the non-profit Employee Benefit Research Institute and Greenwald and Associates.  USA TODAY asked experts for their five top tips to boost savings:  Delay gratification. Don\\'t buy everything you see, says Gary Schatsky, a New York City financial planner and president of ObjectiveAdvice.com. People have to take stock of their needs vs. wants. \"Needs must be met. Wants can be delayed. One of the things you need is a good retirement plan, some savings for emergencies and a plan for the future.\" You have to make a list of what you need and want, he says. \"You can enjoy lattes, dinners out and vacations as long as you are saving. You have to decide what\\'s important to you and start saying no to the things that are not.\"  Save 10% to 15% of your annual income. \"While that may seem like a daunting amount, if you set it up early, you can learn to live on the amount that\\'s left,\" says Fidelity Investments EVP John Sweeney. \"We recommend putting 10% to 15% right into retirement accounts, because a lot of our retirement savings is going to be up to us.\"  By investing in a 401(k) or 403(b), or an Individual Retirement Account (IRA), you can reduce your taxable income, he says. \"You are saving money because you are paying taxes on the lower income level.\"  Take advantage of matching contributions. If your employer offers matching contributions in your savings plan, take it, Sweeney says.  Save your raise. \"If you get a raise, bank it,\" Sweeney says. Consider investing all or a portion of your raises each year, he says. You can do the same with bonuses or tax refunds.  Pay off high-interest-rate credit card debt. If you are paying 18% interest on credit card debt, \"that\\'s eating a hole in your pocket,\" Sweeney says. It\\'s important to pay it off, if you can, or the second choice is to think about ways to reduce the interest payment, such as getting a home-equity loan at a lower rate.  Another option is to continue working during your retirement years, says Nick Ventura, CEO of Ventura Wealth Management in Ewing, N.J. \"Many part-time jobs exist in retail, health care and other businesses. Helping people and bringing life experience to these jobs can be very rewarding.\"',\n",
       " 'HS - Personal Finance Osborne urged to maintain savings confidence in Budget announcement Chancellor George Osborne may not be plotting any giveaways in next week\\'s Budget but he is being urged to maintain confidence in savings.  The Building Societies Association wants a First ISA scheme, with the government chipping in a first-year incentive. If the government paid 20p per £1 saved up to a cap of £100 per saver, it would the cost the Treasury a paltry £70m, falling to £35m a year, but would create half a million new savers in the first year and then 140,000 every year, the BSA claims.  ISA providers report to the taxman the National Insurance number and account details for each saver holding an ISA every year, so HMRC could identify first-time savers.  The BSA also wants rules simplified to make it easier for low-income savers to get a 10p savings tax refund, and for non-taxpayers to register for gross interest. Building societies are also repeating their past call for an increase in the subscription limit on cash ISAs to equal that of stocks and shares ISAs, and for unlimited transfers in either direction.  The BSA\\'s chief executive, Robin Fieth, said: \"Savers know the ISA brand so it makes sense for it to be used for a scheme which aims to grow the number of consumers who have some kind of savings buffer. Clearly, no single scheme is capable of fixing the UK savings culture, but it\\'s a step in the right direction.\"  Nationwide backs those measures, and also wants a more generous ISA limit for first-time homebuyers who saving in a dedicated ISA towards a deposit.  The society also suggests stamp duty should be tiered, not imposed in a slab, to \"overcome the current distortions created in the housing market\".  The Chancellor may offer some consolation to low income savers by allowing small pension pots, perhaps up to £40,000, to be refunded in cash rather than used to buy a tiny annuity. It could benefit 150,000 people a year.  Tom McPhail at Hargreaves Lansdown says: \"Reforming the small pots rule will help to unlock improvements right across the pension system. Small investors will get their money back, insurers will be able to sell better value annuities to large customers, and it will help to minimise auto-enrolment opt-outs.\"  Hargreaves also suggests a Long Term Care ISA, which could be passed on to dependants if not needed to fund nursing.  Meanwhile, the 40p tax rate is now catching one million more people than it did three years ago, according to the Institute of Fiscal Studies.  The rate will kick in at £31,866 in 2014-5.  Ronnie Ludwig, tax expert at Saffery Champness in Edinburgh, says: \"Although pulling more people into higher tax is the Chancellor\\'s way of paying for the increase in the personal allowance, he may feel that with the next election looming, now is the time to ease the burden.\"',\n",
       " 'Financial Post Investing How to play the U.S. weather rebound Investors should get ready for spring economic surprises as the United States thaws out from an unusually long and harsh winter, says CIBC World Markets.  Recent data from the U.S. have been surprisingly weak and many economists have rushed to blame a spate of winter storms in the fourth quarter of 2013 and first quarter of 2014 as the culprit. Andrew Grantham, CIBC World Markets economist, said investors should prepare their portfolios for what could be a strong rebound from the winter weakness over the next few months.  \"While we\\'re far from the first to blame the weather for Q1 weakness, our results point to a much more decisive rebound than the market has priced in,\" he said in a note to clients. \"As more seasonal temperatures (hopefully!) return in Q2, and the economy catches up with postponed activity, the data flow will strengthen and second quarter growth could easily surpass consensus expectations.\" In particular, Mr. Grantham believes a strong winter rebound will reverse the recent bond rally and support a stronger U.S. dollar. U.S. Treasury yields have recently fallen to 2.6% from 3% at the end of 2013 as investors rushed back to safety following dismal job data and retail sales in the U.S. \"If bad weather has driven almost the entire slowdown in Q1 GDP, it shouldn\\'t be long until warmer data rolls in and the 10-year yield and U.S. dollar are back to at least where they were [early this year], if not higher,\" he said.  If winter weather is to blame for the recent weakness, consumer-related equities are another area economists have suggested could rebound this spring. Mr. Grantham notes some of that expectation has already been priced in, though consumer staples appear to have been overlooked.  \"Much of that already appears to be baked into analysts\\' earnings expectations, with earnings per share estimates for discretionary consumer goods companies much higher in the coming quarter, even compared with two quarters ago,\" he said. \"Against less rosy earnings expectations, consumer staples could offer more upside, as even in this area some purchases may have been postponed.\"  There is the possibility, of course, that some of the weakness in the past two quarters is more than just bad weather. Some economists have suggested the large amount of inventory built up in the second half of 2013 could also explain the weakness. Mr. Grantham agrees, but suggests investors should not lose too much sleep over it.  \"Even though stock-building won\\'t be as strong going forwards, there is little reason to expect aggressive de-stocking as inventory-to-sales ratios are no higher in most areas than they were a year ago,\" he said.

       " 'Business Perpetual push to lift super contributions Investment - Retirement savings call  Perpetual chief executive Geoff Lloyd has backed raising compulsory superannuation contributions to 15 per cent, saying the federal government\\'s financial services inquiry should consider it.  Mr Lloyd said existing moves to lift the super guarantee from 9 per cent to 12 per cent in 2021 were important, but the Murray inquiry should look beyond that and find ways to encourage young people to think about pension planning earlier.  \"I\\'d like to think it can get to 15 per cent. Our politicians are getting 15, so why isn\\'t that good enough for everyone in Australia,\" Mr Lloyd told Fairfax Media on the sidelines of Citi\\'s Australian Investment Conference in London.  While he acknowledged raising contributions to 15 per cent would not happen soon, more radical measures needed to be considered as part of the inquiry. Younger Australians also needed to start thinking about their superannuation earlier.  \"I personally would hope we get a chance to revisit the fundamentals of how we help Australians to re-engage in their super and get kids to start to think about it in high school so they take more ownership of it earlier,\" Mr Lloyd said.  \"I hate to think that Australians are all in default funds. We have an obligation to help the kids of Australia plan for and live well in their retirement. We still have a large and growing retirement savings gap.  Australia\\'s $1.7 trillion superannuation industry is expected to be a key focus of the inquiry, led by former Commonwealth Bank of Australia chief executive David Murray.  Mr Lloyd, who runs one of the country\\'s biggest fund managers, has argued the inquiry should reduce the complexity of the compulsory retirement savings system.  The focus on self-managed super funds to invest in property was creating unsustainable prices and should also be examined by the inquiry, he said. This should also include examining the role of regulators and self-managed super funds to ensure investors were protected.  Australia\\'s compulsory retirement system is a hot topic for investors at the Citi conference, where 24 chief executives are meeting European fund managers responsible for several trillion dollars in assets. Mr Lloyd told investors the company\\'s $50 million cost saving program was on track as it worked to simplify its business.  Perpetual won a three-way bidding war for The Trust Company last year and is in the throes of integrating into its business the financial services company, which provides trustee services to clients. Mr Lloyd said $15 million targeted annual savings from removing duplication would come from cutting staff numbers, integrating IT and property.  \"We want to accelerate the growth they have got there [Singapore] in their current plan and then see what corporate trust products we have in Australia that might be useful to take up to the region, including securitisation, for instance.\"  Michael Smith travelled to London courtesy of Citi.',\n",

       " 'Business Five money talks To have with the family  For some provinces, Monday is Family Day. It\\'s the perfect opportunity to spend quality time with your loved ones and then talk to them about estate planning and debt. We asked Robert Kerr, founder of Kerr Financial Group and his daughter, Krista, who is the company\\'s CEO, to identify five money topics to discuss with the family.  1 Broach the subject of estate planning with your parents. This is often not the easiest conversation to have. \"You don\\'t want to seem like you\\'re interfering in your parents affairs,\" Ms. Kerr says. \"You don\\'t want to seem like you\\'re counting their money and you also don\\'t want to think about the scary idea that they might not be around.\" She suggests that you be upfront about your fears and start with questions such as: Do you have a will? Do you have a financial advisor that you are speaking to? \"Sometimes, it\\'s your own fear about talking about these matters more than it is the father or mother\\'s fear,\" Mr. Kerr says.  2 Talk to your adult kids about your estate plans.  Assure your children that you\\'ve made some preparations and explain your choices. Tell them about your charitable bequeaths. \"There have been a number of cases in estate planning where children have upset by the fact that they didn\\'t know that charitable gifts were being made,\" Ms. Kerr says. \"If there are trusts, help the children understand why they\\'re in place and it\\'s not that you don\\'t trust them with the spending necessarily.\"  3 Raise the issue of capacity. Have your loved ones ever given thought to what will happen if they ever become physically or mentally disabled and are not able to make medical or financial decisions? \"[Ask them:] do you have powers of attorney in place? If something happens and it\\'s hard for you to take care of yourself, what is quality of life to you? They\\'re important conversations to have and they\\'re easier to have before you\\'re in a crisis,\" Ms. Kerr says.  4 Discuss debt. \"If you have a child or a family member or a sibling in [financial] trouble, the instinct is to help them pay things off,\" Ms. Kerr says. \"That can be problematic. Sometimes you can enable the problem if you just keep giving money; but if you try to preach to them ... that can be very difficult too.\" Try not to be judgmental and tell your loved one that your intention is to help them.  5 Talk about your money values. How have you dealt with money in your past? \"There\\'s a lot of history that doesn\\'t get passed on to children,\" Mr. Kerr says. \"You are passing along values that people can think about and they don\\'t feel like they\\'re being preached to - they\\'re just hearing a good story.\"',\n",
       " 'Top Stories Fidelity\\'s Profit Up 13% As Outflows Decline Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based asset manager and discount brokerage, said the operating income of its financial services business rose 13% to $2.6 billion, though investors continued to pull money from the company\\'s stock and bond mutual funds.  Investors pulled a net $7.8 billion from Fidelity\\'s stock products in 2013, even as the rest of the industry saw substantial inflows into such funds. Last year, U.S. stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds overall garnered more than $172 billion from investors, according to research firm Lipper Inc. In 2012, Fidelity\\'s stock products saw withdrawals of $32.4 billion.  Fidelity, which mostly owns funds run by active managers, has struggled to keep assets as investors move to lower-cost passively managed index funds and exchange traded funds. Fidelity was once the country\\'s largest mutual fund manager but in 2010 fell behind Malvern, Pa.-based Vanguard Group.  Fidelity in January said asset management chief Ron O\\'Hanley would step down at the end of February, a move that some analysts said wasn\\'t surprising. Fidelity president Abigail Johnson is expected to eventually succeed her father, Fidelity Chairman Edward C. \"Ned\" Johnson III.  Fidelity\\'s bond products, a bright spot in 2012 with $16.3 billion in inflows, saw outflows of about $19.6 billion. Fidelity attributed the reversal to investors anticipating the end of Federal Reserve stimulus programs and an increase in interest rates.  The company\\'s managed account offerings garnered inflows of $17.7 billion, while its managed asset allocation strategies attracted $9.2 billion in customer money.  Fidelity\\'s total customer assets under management ended 2013 at $1.94 trillion, up 15% from the end of 2012, in part from substantial stock market gains.  Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said Fidelity is best known for expertise in investment management, but the company has grown to become \"much more than a mutual fund company.\" Fidelity\\'s total assets under administration, which includes managed products, brokerage accounts and other money invested through Fidelity platforms, ended the year up 19% at $4.6 trillion.  Fidelity\\'s outflows came despite good performance from many of its actively managed funds. Fidelity\\'s stock funds beat about 68% of their peers in 2013, versus 74% during the prior year. Its investment-grade bond funds beat 62% of their peers in 2013, compared with 42% in 2012.  Among Fidelity\\'s rivals, Vanguard in 2013 saw an estimated $74.6 billion of inflows into its mutual funds, according to research firm Morningstar, while BlackRock Inc. saw inflows of $11.2 billion. Pacific Investment Management Co. saw outflows of $30.4 billion, propelled by $40.4 billion in withdrawals from the company\\'s flagship Pimco Total Return mutual fund.

       " 'Money Technology can deliver big returns Under the radar  Small caps are all about leverage. When you are small, you get a bigger bang for your buck, and nowhere is this more the case than in technology.  Just look at the 163 per cent growth in first half net profit of Objective Corp, announced in late January. This company has a market cap of $56 million, yet it is winning contracts with big corporations and governments. It builds software that helps the Australian Government track documents, ensuring that emails go to the right person.  Software is sexy from an investment perspective because for very little cost, you can get access to billions of people. One of Radar\\'s favourites, eServGlobal, has more than tripled since we first tipped it in 2012, and much of this is based on the potential of its HomeSend technology, which allows the diaspora of the world to send money back to their homes via their mobile phones. This business isn\\'t even profitable yet!  eServ is one of a number of software developments centred around mobile payments companies. Many of these stocks are hot property as investors see the use of smart phones and tablets grow.  But there is also a great deal of risk in software developers of all types. The reality is that many will fail because of the big initial spend on research and development and the uncertainty over whether people will pay for it.  It is not just the small companies where there is risk. Xero has had massive success with its online offering of accounting software. It has a market cap close to $5 billion, but it is a number of years away from making a profit.  \"Xero is in a customer grab at the moment and because capital markets open, it\\'s not worried about raising money to fund [these losses], but ultimately you have to generate capital internally to have a sustainable business,\" says Nick Harris, the technology analyst at Morgans Stockbroking.  A safer bet could be the IT services sector, which is the sector\\'s biggest contributor to the ASX by market capitalisation (outside of telecommunications).  Their business model is to have an army of contractors who charge hourly rates and do project-related work. These companies make platforms like Microsoft and Salesforce talk to each other.  After fast growth in the late 1990s and early 2000s, the sector has stuttered as companies reduce their spending on IT. Traditionally IT spending increases at about 5 per cent a year, but in the past five years in the wake of the financial crisis, this has reduced to 2 per cent.  Harris believes that spending on the sector will increase from its historic lows and consequently advocates buying SMS Technology UXC and Oakton.

       " 'NEWS Solar panels better than a pension, says minister; Energy minister says those approaching retirement should consider putting some of their savings into solar panels because they would deliver a better financial return than a pension Installing solar panels on household roofs is a better investment than a pension, a minister has said.  Greg Barker, the energy minister, said that anyone approaching retirement should consider putting some of their savings into solar panels because they would deliver a better financial return than a pension.  Mr Barker disclosed that 500,000 British homes have installed solar panels, which allow users to generate their own electricity and sell any excess power to energy firms.  Installing panels can cost several thousand pounds, but savings on bills and the ability to sell excess power mean households can turn a profit over time.  To encourage domestic solar power, the Government offers to guarantee the price at which users can sell their excess electricity. The guaranteed price was cut in 2012, but the Government continues to provide a subsidy.  Prices for solar panels have fallen sharply in recent years. According to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, the typical domestic installation costs around £4,500, compared with £13,000 in 2010.  That means that typical rates of return on domestic solar panels are between 5 per cent and 8 per cent a year, government figures show.  Mr Barker said that makes solar power a better investment than some pensions. Many pensioners buy a retirement income by investing in an annuity, a contract guaranteeing them an annual income for life.  Returns on annuities have fallen in recent years, and typical products deliver an income of around £6,000 for every £100,000 of pension savings.  Mr Barker said that those planning for retirement should think about putting some money into solar panels instead of a traditional pension.  \"Solar is a really attractive financial proposition,\" the minister told The Daily Telegraph. \"You get a guaranteed tariff for 20 years and if your panel is well-sited, it could yield 8 per cent or more. That is more than an annuity, particularly if you are in your 50s or early 60s.\"  He added: \"Anyone considering retiring should seriously consider whether solar panels are right for them, because in some circumstances, they will get a higher return than from putting the money into an annuity.\"  The minister\\'s financial argument is part of an attempt to improve the image of renewable energy sources, which are unpopular with some voters and many Conservative MPs.  Official figures showed last month that 499,687 domestic solar schemes had been installed, Mr Barker said the total has since passed 500,000.  - For those who have already saved:  Six funds to pick for retirement income   - For those who want to start saving: How to retire early on a DIY pension   - For fund and share tips: enter your email for our weekly newsletter   Use our free Annuity Calculator to discover how much income you could receive.',\n",
       " 'Retailing John Lewis takes shine off its gold-plated pension John Lewis has set out controversial plans to water down its £3 billion pension fund in a move that means tens of thousands of staff will lose out on their gold plated retirement benefits.  The owner of the department store chain and Waitrose said yesterday that it was making proposals including that staff gain retirement payouts at a lower rate than in the past.  At the moment new company joiners work for three years before being enrolled in John Lewis\\'s final salary scheme but in future that will be extended to five years, it said. An accompanying, and less generous, defined contribution scheme will continue for the rest of their career at the group, rather than ending when they switch schemes, John Lewis said yesterday.  It is thought this is to help make up for some of the expected shortfall from other changes.  At the same time, the final salary scheme will begin paying out only when staff reach the official state pension age, which is being extended in stages, rather than at 65, the age at which staff can stop work at present.  In addition, future pension increases will be linked to changes in consumer price inflation, capped at 2.5 per cent, rather than the retail price index, in a tweak that is increasingly conventional but tends to reduce the size of rises.  John Lewis, which has been consulting staff on pensions since March, said yesterday that the sweeping changes were intended to protect the future of the scheme, which was labouring under a deficit of £840 million at the last count.  John Lewis\\'s pension scheme is one of the most generous in the workplace as staff do not have to make a contribution from their monthly earnings. The partnership, which is owned by its 85,500-strong workforce, is also increasingly rare in providing a final salary scheme, which links retirement earnings to workers\\' pay at the time they leave work.  Companies have increasingly found final salary schemes unaffordable as staff live on longer after they retire and pension fund investments are ravaged by volatile stock markets.  John Lewis still has to finalise the precise rate at which staff will accrue benefits, and the proposals will be subject to a vote by its Partnership Council later this year.  However, while the planned changes are bound to raise hackles among its workforce, some pension experts argued yesterday that John Lewis\\'s pension scheme was still unsustainable.  John Ralfe, an independent pensions consultant said: \"What they have done today does not go anything like far enough and we will see them having to revisit the pensions issue in the next few years.\"  He added that John Lewis\\'s ownership structure means it is politically difficult to dilute staff benefits because they own the company and have a say in its running.  The scheme has more than 110,000 members, but less than half, or 48,423, are current employees.',\n",
       " 'Schroders moves pension assets into bonds Schroders, an asset management group that has been at the forefront of change in the pensions industry, has switched a large chunk of its £807m pension fund assets out of equities into bonds.  The move undermines forecasts by some analysts that the 2013 market rally would reverse the decade-long trend of defined benefit pension schemes, which guarantee retirement income, reducing their exposure to the volatility of equities.  Others are expected to follow Schroders in moving into lower risk areas after a period of strong stock market performance. As equities rose on the back of a rosier economic outlook, pension assets were boosted too. As a result, more pension schemes are less dependent on punchy returns to meet their liabilities and can afford to turn to less volatile, lower-yielding fixed income investments.  Alan Brown, a trustee of the Schroders pension scheme, said: \"The improvement in financial markets has given us another opportunity to reduce risk.\"  A pension trustee of another big UK scheme said it was looking at further de-risking its portfolios in a similar way to Schroders because of the recovery and increasing likelihood that interest rates would rise.  An interest rate rise helps pension schemes as it improves their balance sheets by reducing deficits. Pension scheme deficits are worked out by bond yields, which tends to move in line with interest rates. The higher the bond yield, the more the pension fund is expected to earn in returns.  The move by Schroders, which with about £250bn in assets under management is Europe\\'s second biggest independent asset management group, is a significant development given the ageing profile of the UK population.  Life expectancy in the UK has increased by 10 years for men to 84 and by eight years to 89 for women over the past 50 years, according to the Office for National Statistics.  The jump in equities has been the main cause of Schroders\\' defined benefit pension scheme having a funding ratio of 110 per cent, which means that its assets are 10 per cent higher than its liabilities.  The funding ratio for UK funds has improved in recent months to 97.6 per cent, says the National Association of Pension Funds. However, more defined benefit schemes are in deficit than surplus, 3,701 versus 2,449.  The Schroders fund has switched approximately 50 per cent of its growth assets, which relied heavily on equities to produce returns, into a strategic beta portfolio, which relies more on safer fixed income assets.  Schroders\\' pension scheme led the way in 2005 moving from a traditional benchmark-based portfolio invested in assets such as equities and bonds to one investing in a diversified range of growth assets, which included stocks and fixed income.  The company has 723 retired and 2,521 deferred members in its defined benefit scheme. Assets are forecast to peak in about 2040 and the fund\\'s so-called tail of liabilities will run until about 2080.',\n",
       " 'Financial Post Business-friendly Canada overtakes U.S. in ranking; Jumps four spots on list of best countries for doing business Canada, struggling to emerge from a two-year slump brought on by weak exports, has swept past the United States, Germany and Japan in a Bloomberg ranking of the best countries for doing business.  Canada rose four places to reach second place, behind only Hong Kong, which led for a third straight year. The U.S. fell one spot to third place in the index that\\'s based on six criteria, followed by Singapore and Australia.  The rise in the ranking for Canada reflects recent corporate tax cuts and the impact of a weakening dollar that policymakers are projecting will help the world\\'s 11th-largest economy rebound from weaker-than-expected exports. A falling dollar lowers input costs relative to competitors, while the tax cuts helped make investments more profitable.  \"Those are two big factors,\" said John Manley, a former Canadian finance minister who is now head of the Ottawa-based Canadian Council of Chief Executives. \"Compared with a lot of the world, we have a pretty good story to tell.\"  After rising for much of the previous decade, Canada\\'s currency has depreciated since 2011, amid weakening commodity prices and as investors regained confidence in the U.S. economy. The drop has accelerated since October, when the Bank of Canada dropped its bias for higher interest rates, a move that Prime Minister Stephen Harper endorsed. The dollar is down 14% from its postrecession high on July 21, 2011, and has dropped 6.2% since the bank\\'s Oct. 22 announcement.  Mr. Harper has also sought to bolster the expansion with tax cuts, trade deals such as the recently announced pact with the European Union and efforts to build energy infrastructure.  Mr. Harper, in power since 2006, gradually cut the rate to 15% from above 22%, a move opposition lawmakers have said is unaffordable when the government is running deficits.  Lower corporate taxes helped fuel federal shortfalls that are poised to top $160-billion between 2008 and 2015, according to finance department projections released in November.  Mr. Manley said its important not to become complacent, and is urging the federal government to pay \"close attention\" to training and skills issues, infrastructure development and make sure trade agreements get implemented.  \"Competitiveness is one of those things that you could never say you\\'ve achieved it,\" Mr. Manley said. \"Holding on to No. 2 is not going to be easy.\"  Brett Gundlock, National Post Files / John Manley, chief executive of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, stresses the need for training and skills development to enable Canada to retain its competitive edge in the world.; Brett Gundlock, National Post Files / John Manley, chief executive of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, stresses the need for training and skills development to enable Canada to retain its competitive edge in the world.

       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING Bundled mortgage defaults hit high; CAPITAL MARKETS Europe total driven up by high leverage  80% fail to repay principal in full  The default rate of \"sliced and diced\" loans backed by commercial mortgages in Europe has hit a two-year high, highlighting difficulties in resuscitating the securitisation market.  Nearly 80 per cent of holders of 31 commercial mortgage-backed securities, representing ?2.3bn in loans and which were due to mature in the last quarter of 2013, failed to repay their principal completely, according to Moody\\'s, the credit ratings agency. The figure, driven upwards by high levels of leverage, is the highest quarterly default rate for two years.  \"You had a quarter of particularly weak loans - on a rolling average basis we\\'ve seen a repayment rate of the principal of around a third in the previous year,\" said Andrea Daniels, an associate managing director at Moody\\'s.  \"One of the big credit negative implications has not only been poor performance - which means value decline - on underlying secondary quality properties but a lack of finance available to refinance these types of properties . . . therefore you have this very low repayment rate.\"  CMBS package pools of commercial mortgage loans for sale to fixed income investors. About half of the loans which defaulted were secured by assets in the UK while nearly a third had their assets in Germany.  The figures sound a warning for securities investors who have helped propel a modest resurgence in Europe\\'s CMBS market .  Overall CMBS issuance, virtually zero in 2009, touched $6.4bn last year, up from $2.5bn in 2012, according to Dealogic, the data provider.  Both European and US governments have sought to encourage bank-led mortgage lending to stimulate wider economic growth.  Part of the reason CMBS sales shot up is that borrowers took advantage of record-low interest rates to refinance their loans. However, one London-based CMBS analyst said recent issuance reflected more realistic valuations compared to a pre-crisis boom.  \"It\\'s a cyclical sector,\" the person said. \"We\\'ve been through the pain and moved through a more appropriately priced place post-crisis.\"  Since the pre-crisis loans were made, assets such as office developments and out-of-town retail parks, have fallen in value since 2009 . Moreover, many of the loans contained within the CMBS had loan-to-value ratios of more than 90 per cent. A little more than a third of the CMBS were repaid fully at maturity in the previous four quarters.  About ?14.6bn of European CMBS are due to mature or refinance in 2014.  Historically, banks have sold CMBS and other asset-backed securities to fixed income investors seeking steady interest payments while freeing more capital for loans.  Amid a gloomy few years for Europe\\'s securitisation market some analysts have predicted that issuance from eurozone peripheral countries, such as Italy, will increase this year as banks try to take advantage of investors\\' higher risk appetite in their hunt for yield.',\n",
       " 'News Millions stop saving because nest egg may be lost to care costs MORE than three million middleaged and retired people have given up saving for old age, believing what they put aside will be taken to pay for their care, research suggests.  The Government\\'s long-awaited overhaul of the care system, currently before Parliament, will fail if large numbers abandon saving for later life, Britain\\'s biggest charity for the elderly warned.  Age UK said that the system, which will cap what people must pay for care in their lifetime, relies on individuals contributing to the cost.  Based on the recommendations of a commission chaired by Andrew Dilnot, an economist, the reform is due to come into force in just over two years.  It will introduce a theoretical £72,000 cap on what anyone must pay for care in their lifetime, overhaul assessments of whether people are frail enough to need care, and create a deferred payment scheme to prevent people\\'s homes having to be sold to fund care while they are alive.  But ministers have been criticised after it became clear that the latter scheme will not be available to those with modest savings of about £23,000.  One recent study estimated that more than a million families had to sell a home in the past five years to pay care bills.  With council budgets under strain, more than 450,000 elderly and disabled people who would have received state support for care a few years ago are now shut out of the system, academics at the London School of Economics have calculated.  Ministers say the reforms should enable people to avoid \"catastrophic\" bills for the care they may need in later life and provide enough certainty for them to plan for costs they may incur, possibly by purchasing insurance.  But polling for the charity found that almost three in 10 people aged over 50 are no longer saving for their future needs, the vast majority agreeing that there is \"no point\".  Of them, more than half singled out a view that anything they save \"will just be taken away later\" when they need care. That equates to about 3.2million people in mainland Britain.  Age UK warned that a lack of clarity could be adding to uncertainty and undermining the reform.  Caroline Abrahams, the charity\\'s director, said: \"The Government needs to give people a realistic idea of what they can expect to be paying for in the future.  \"There is an urgent need for a frank and honest debate around the funding of care and who will have to pay for what.\"  Ruth Isden, its head of public services, said: \"If we are looking at a system which was designed to encourage people to save towards the cost of later life and care by trying to give some certainty about the costs and it looks like it is not encouraging those people to do so, then it isn\\'t going as far as it needs to.\"',\n",
       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING UK money managers fear stocks are overvalued Nearly half of all UK money managers believe that share prices are in bubble territory following one of the biggest annual stock market rallies in more than a decade, according to new research.  Of the investment managers polled by the CFA Society, the largest organisation of UK asset managers, 44 per cent believe stocks in developed markets were overvalued during the last quarter of 2013, up from 37 per cent the quarter before.  The survey added that two-thirds of money managers believe corporate bonds are overvalued while 78 per cent of respondents think government bonds are richly priced. By contrast, half of the respondents said that stocks in emerging markets are undervalued, the largest proportion of any asset class, although this is a slight decline from the third quarter.  Will Goodhard, CFA\\'s chief executive, said the poll chimed with a broader market view that the quantitative easing programmes pursued by the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan helped inflate some asset prices.  \"It appears that members see the stimulative central bank monetary policies as having inflated asset values broadly,\" he said. \"During the third quarter, there had been signs that our members believed we were moving towards a normalised market . . . the final quarter of 2013 marks a reversal of this trend, with the perception that asset classes are overvalued rising across the board, most markedly in developed market equities and government bonds.\"  The poll comes after the Fed announced earlier this month that it would begin tapering its QE programme from $85bn to $75bn per month.  Equity fund inflows have hit record levels this year on the back of investor confidence in global economic growth. Some analysts said this has led to a \"great rotation\" whereby investors sell bonds - which are seen as mainly defensive investments - and buy stocks.  The MSCI All Country shares index - a bellwether for global equities - has increased by 22 per cent for the year to date, buttressed by gains on developed market bourses .  Nevertheless, Kevin Lilley, manager of European equities at Old Mutual, said investors were too fixated with trying to spot \"black swan\" events and there remained plenty of value to be had in European stocks.  \"With market multiples of current year profits not looking stretched, and economic growth forecast to rise over the next two years at least, surely we should be embracing these markets,\" he said.  Overall, investors pulled $9.4bn out of bond funds in the week before Christmas, according to figures from EPFR Global, the data provider, compared with $3.4bn from equity funds.  Richard McGuire, rates strategist at Rabobank, likened the QE-related rise in asset prices to \"a great flotation\". He added: \"You buy pretty much everything if you want to have a hope of making a return.\"  Many emerging market assets are still recovering from summer volatility when funds saw large outflows after the Fed hinted it would begin tapering earlier than some expected.',\n",
       " 'Financial Post Ministers can\\'t find common ground on CPP; More study If ever there was a deep wedge driven between the federal government and the provinces, the one over pension reform could likely be the one that leaves a lasting mark.  After years of heated discussions on how to enlarge the safety net of the Canadian Pension Plan - and just as many years of being urged not to kick the can down the road - Canada\\'s finance ministers did just that.  Finance Minister Jim Flaherty played down the outcome of Monday\\'s meeting, saying \"we had a frank discussion, particularly about the pension issue.\" But there was to be no resolution.  \"The global economy remains fragile,\" Mr. Flaherty said. \"I encouraged my provincial colleagues to move toward balanced budgets as quickly as they can, just as the government of Canada is.\"  He also appeared to chastise those counterparts for \"making commitments far down the road\" without knowing whether the economy will be able to support those changes.  \"And that was the kind of proposal that was being brought forward [on Monday]. We\\'ll study it some more. ... So maybe two years from now, three years, five years, whatever. I\\'m confident we\\'ll still be the government. I\\'m not sure they\\'ll all still be here,\" he said.  While the ministers attending the meeting at Meech Lake told reporters they were on board with continuing to study options, they accused Ottawa of ignoring the consensus that was reached. \"There was no consensus today on expanding CPP,\" said Kevin Sorenson, minister of state for finance.  \"We believe that CPP payroll taxes can hurt the economy and distract what truly matters for all Canadians - keeping our economy strong and our finances in a strong fiscal footing,\" he said.  \"Now is not the time to take more from the paycheques of Canadians. Families and the economy can simply not afford CPP payroll taxes that would take money out of the pockets of employees, and force employers to cut jobs, to cut hours and to cut wages.\"  Ontario Finance Minister Charles Souza, who promised to go ahead with plans for a separate provincial pension scheme, was visibly angered at Ottawa\\'s refusal to acknowledge that the provincial ministers had reached a consensus. \"I\\'m very disappointed that they used stall tactics,\" he said.  \"We need leadership right now. We need vision and we need to ensure that Canadians all across Canada are protected,\" Mr. Sousa said.  \"This is about all of us collectively, and we had consensus in that regard, and they [the federal government] chose not to move forward, and that I find very disappointing.\"  Changes to the national pension scheme would require approval by Ottawa and two-thirds of the provinces, representing two-thirds of Canada\\'s population. Ontario and P.E.I. are in agreement as are Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Manitoba and Quebec. Still to be won over are British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and New Brunswick.',\n",
       " 'Financial Post Five costs YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN IF YOU THINK YOU HAVE SAVED ENOUGH  A lot of the needs that people conceive of when thinking of the future are routine: What it will cost to live in retirement as they do before retirement, perhaps what will be left for heirs. But there can be much higher costs that eviscerate savings and even the costs of running a home or a rental property when it is harder to haul ladders. Then the costs of retirement rise above what was planned. Says Graeme Egan, financial planner and portfolio manager with KCM Wealth Management Inc. in Vancouver: \"A lot of this is not risks that are front of mind, but that you can anticipate.\" Here are a few of them:  1 Long-term care costs You can\\'t readily estimate what illnesses or conditions may raise your cost of living. If your assets can\\'t cover the bills, it is worth investigating both longterm care and critical-illness policies. Long-term expenses are not just institutional. They could include costly drugs that are not paid by provincial healthcare plans. It could even mean medical travel to the U.S. or other centres for treatments that require long waits in Canada. The costs could include transportation, or foreign hospitalization. Note that travel medical coverage typically excludes pre-existing conditions.  2 What it may cost to maintain your house or cottage If you have to hire help to do the chores you used to handle, costs may skyrocket. House maintenance can be a major expense. It may be nickels and dimes when you are alive. If someone else has to do it because your health doesn\\'t allow it, the bills can mount up, especially if maintenance was deferred in a period of illness or old age.  3 Costs of running a small businesses If you\\'ve done it all and others who take your place will have to hire staff, tradespeople and managers, then you should make provisions in in your retirement budget or will which anticipate the costs. Without such attention, the asset could become a money pit that winds up requiring costly subsidies out of your pocket.  4 Inflation Anyone who remembers the 1970s and the early 1980s when prices rose at double-digit rates knows that our present rate of inflation in the low single digits may not last. Retirement budgets that get most of their cash flow from low-yield Guaranteed Income Certificates and Canada Savings Bonds will lose purchasing power over time. To pace inflation, you need common stocks or other assets that can generate higher incomes over time. Otherwise, a retirement that starts out adequately funded can leave you poor after decades of inflation.  5 Money to help children or grandchildren purchase their own homes It can come out of retirement savings or be included in wills. It will be a gift unlikely to be forgotten, even if it is not strictly your own cost of living.',\n",
       " 'News MONEYBAG MAGGIE IN TAXES SCANDAL; Her will lists £4.7m estate in UK... so where is the rest? £12m mansion is owned by firm in British Virgin isles FORMER Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher may have avoided millions in inheritance tax by keeping a chunk of her fortune offshore.  A copy of her will shows she left a £4.7million estate to be shared among family members.  But the £12million London mansion where the Iron Lady spent the last years of her life is owned by an anonymous trust registered in the British Virgin Islands - a notorious tax haven in the Caribbean.  As a result, she could have avoided up to £5million in inheritance tax - the 40 per cent that would have been due if it was owned by a UK individual.  Richard Murphy, of Tax Research, said: \"It has always been strange that Margaret Thatcher enjoyed the benefits of a property registered in the British Virgin Islands. It is possible that Denis Thatcher set up the trust or other offshore arrangements in order to save tax.\"  Thatcher, PM from 1979 to 1990, died in April following a stroke and was honoured with a £10million ceremonial funeral at taxpayers\\' expense.  Official documents state that \"the gross value of the said estate in the United Kingdom amounts to £4,768,795\".  In the will, made in 1997, Thatcher intended to leave £1million to husband Sir Denis, but he died in 2003.  Instead, her estate was split between her family, with a third each going to her twins Mark and Carol, and the remaining third shared among her grandchildren when they reach the age of 25.  But it does not appear to include the six-bedroom home in Belgravia, central London which is valued at £12.4million.  The property was bought in 1991 by Bakeland Property Ltd, an anonymous offshore trust in Jersey, on a 64-year lease.  It was sub-leased to a second firm of the same name based in the British Virgin Islands.  It is not known who the beneficiaries of Bakeland are. If Thatcher had owned shares in it when she died, UK inheritance tax would have been due on their value.  Probate lawyer Andrew Kidd, of Clintons, said: \"The shares in the BVI Company would be included in Baroness Thatcher\\'s estate, and therefore subject to UK inheritance tax, in so far as they were in her ownership.\"  Baroness Thatcher\\'s financial advisers refused in 2002 to explain why she didn\\'t appear to own her own house, stating: \"No one\\'s going to tell you about that.\"  The will also reveals that Thatcher requested that \"my tiger brooch with sapphire\" should be inherited by Mark\\'s daughter Amanda, 20, who gave a reading at her funeral at St Paul\\'s Cathedral.  The former PM left £50,000 and a brooch with emeralds and ruby diamonds to her personal assistant and close friend Cynthia Crawford.

Festiva Hospitality Group strives to be at the forefront of the industry, and has achieved this goal through RTX and the unique travel opportunities and savings that it affords members.  There are three levels of membership for the RTX program: basic, premium and premium plus. The basic level of membership is a free membership that allows owners to explore the destinations that are available for exchange, deposit their timeshare, and manage their traveler profile while only having to pay a $117 \\xa0domestic or international exchange fee once their travel has been confirmed.  The premium membership affords all of the benefits of a basic membership, with several added bonuses including: earned rebates on all transactions, discounts on hotel stays, car rentals and cruises and resort stays for as low as $199 a week.  The premium plus membership is the highest level of benefits that RTX has to offer.

       " \"Top Stories U.S. Regulators to Take Over Furniture Brands Pension Plan U.S. regulators are moving to take over the pension plan of Furniture Brands International Inc., one of the nation's largest furniture manufacturers, as the bankrupt company prepares to sell its business to buyout firm KPS Capital Partners LP.  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the U.S. agency that steps in when employers can't pay out promised pension benefits, said Thursday it will take over Furniture Brands' plan, which covers about 19,000 people and is underfunded by about $272 million.  The St. Louis-based furniture maker--whose brands include Broyhill, Lane, Drexel Heritage and Thomasville--will head to bankruptcy court Friday for approval to sell its assets to KPS for $280 million. KPS isn't assuming the plan.  The PBGC, created under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, takes over a private-sector pension plan after determining an employer is unable to keep paying benefits.  The regulator said it expected to cover $270 million of the $272 million shortfall. The pension watchdog pays guaranteed benefits of about $57,500 a year to retirees aged 65 or over.  Earlier this week, Furniture Brands said it would funnel $25 million from the sale of its business to a special account to cover the U.S. government's pension claims against its foreign subsidiaries' assets. That deal ring-fenced Furniture Brands' foreign subsidiaries from collection efforts tied to the U.S. pensions and cleared the way for the sale to KPS.  Furniture Brands, which employs some 9,000 people in the U.S. and abroad, filed for bankruptcy in September with a deal to sell the bulk of its assets to Oaktree Capital Management, but KPS replaced the Los Angeles-based buyout firm as the stalking horse, or lead, bidder for the company's assets.  One of the company's big shareholders, Samuel Kuo's Samson Holding Ltd. (0531.HK), of Hong Kong, had planned to bid on Furniture Brands but a qualified bid didn't materialize. With no other qualified bidders, an auction slated for Thursday has been canceled.  Judge Christopher Sontchi of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., has scheduled a hearing to approve the sale for Friday.  Like other manufacturers, Furniture Brands has suffered from the lingering effects of the recession and foreign competition. The company had sales of about $1 billion in 2012, roughly half of what it brought in a decade ago.  But the manufacturer's financial difficulties run deeper than the ups and downs of the business cycle. Furniture Brands hasn't made a profit in six years and analysts are predicting another loss in 2013.

       " 'FINANCE Decline in household income \\'halted\\'; New Asda data suggests pressure on family budgets easing, while John Lewis sales rise above £100m The pressure on family budgets is showing signs of easing in the run-up to Christmas, potentially delivering a timely boost to retailers and the British economy.  The latest Asda income tracker shows that for the first time since June, the amount of money available to families for discretionary items has not fallen compared to last year.  A spokesman for the Treasury said the Asda data \"is the latest sign that Britain\\'s hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity\".  Despite the British economy returning to growth, retailers have endured a mixed 2013 with consumer spending still restricted by price inflation growing ahead of wage inflation.  However, the Asda survey stated that the average UK household had £158 of discretionary income in October, unchanged on the same month in 2012.  It recorded a sharp fall in annual essential item inflation, down 0.7pc to 2.1pc the lowest rate since February 2010. Mortgage payments and fuel prices were down, but budgets are still being squeezed by low wage growth and rising energy costs.  Andy Clarke, chief executive of Asda, said: \"There is a glimmer of hope that we\\'re on the right track for 2014. But without a substantial improvement in income growth the journey to recovery will be slow.\"  John Lewis, the department store, also suggested the pressure on consumers is easing by recording weekly sales of more than £100m for the first time this year.  The retailer reported a 10.7pc year-on-year increase in sales and a 11.4pc increase in week-on-week sales, with sales of clothing, boots and slippers helped by the onset of cooler weather.  Andrew Murphy, retail director, said John Lewis was \"delighted\" with its sales performance and that it was the earliest week in a year that the retailer had recorded sales of more than £100m.  Any indication that British shoppers are ready to spend ahead of the vital Christmas period will be welcomed by retailers.  Fashion retailers in particular were struck by unseasonably warm weather at the end of September and start of October, with new data showing a sharp drop in footfall on high streets.  According to the British Retail Consortium and Springboard, UK retail footfall fell by 2.9pc in October, worse than the 2.4pc fall in September. For three months to the end of October, footfall was down 2.1pc, the worst performance since the start of the year.  Helen Dickinson, director-general of the BRC, said: \"Although recent months have hinted at economic recovery, many of us are still cautious and keen to manage budgets ahead of Christmas.  \"Despite the tentative optimism in the air, it\\'s clear that conditions remain challenging. Retailers will be hoping that a festive boost to browsing and buying puts things back on a more even keel over the coming months.\"',\n",

       " 'Russia enters list of top 10 travel destinations Russia\\'s influence in the world tourist market is growing, as it enters the top 10 most popular tourist destinations in the world. That is according to Taleb Rifai, the Secretary-General of the World Tourist Organisation (UNWTO) who participated in the opening of the Russian stand at the World Travel Market expo in London.  \"Last year 26 million foreign tourists visited Russia. It is now the world\\'s number 9 most popular tourist destination. It is a result of hard work, including work on a political level\", he said. Other countries on the top-10 most visited countries list include France, USA, China, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Germany, UK and Malaysia.  According to the head of UNWTO, the growth of tourism into Russia could even further benefit from softening the visa regime and cancelling visa requirements for transit passengers of up to 3 days. The bill is currently being mulled over by the Russian parliament.  \"We are also anxiously waiting for the Sochi Olympics, which is incredibly important not just for sports, but also for tourism\", says Mr Rifai.  Russia\\'s Ambassador to the UK Alexander Yakovenko, as well as the Head of Russia\\'s Tourism Agency Alexander Radkov both emphasized the importance of softening the visa regime. \"If not cancelled altogether, it should at least be softened for tourist trips\", said Radkov. He pointed out that because of the issues with the British visa, some members of the Russian delegation were unable to attend the expo.  But despite the visa barriers, the number of participants from Russia at the WTM is growing each year, according to the Ambassador. This time representatives of some 15 regions including St. Petersburg and Moscow presented their latest offers, hotels and hot destinations on the Russian stand.  The Russian capital is also preparing for a tourist boom. Moscow is awaiting a significant influx of travellers who plan to stop in the capital on their way to see the Olympics. Sergey Shpilko, the head of the Moscow Tourism Committee, says no matter how many people are coming, all visitors will be taken care of. \"We prepare to meet the people at the airports and railway stations, we are training the volunteers. Along with existing tourist information centres, we plan to open several new ones in Moscow\\'s major airports\", says Shpilko.  Tourists will have plenty of ways to see the capital even on a brief stopover with transit tours around Moscow lasting from half day to 3-day packages. Mr Shpilko also promised hotel accommodation at record low prices: \"You can find a hostel room starting at 650 rubles, a 2-star hotel at 750 and a 3-star accommodation starting at 1500rubles. These are standard European prices\", says the official.  The World Travel Market exhibition takes place at theExCel exhibition centre in East London and lasts for 4 days. With some 5,000 participants from 184 countries it is the world\\'s largest event of this kind.',\n",
       " 'OnLine Public-sector pension plans look to reduce benefits, including early retirement About one-third of Canada\\'s public sector pension plans are looking to reduce indexing to inflation or ancillary benefits such as generous early retirements, with some considering eliminating indexing altogether, according to a survey released Wednesday by human resources consultant AON Hewitt.  The survey analyzed 139 pension plans with more than $250-billion of assets and two million plan members. It reveals a wide range of actions being taken and considered to manage the risk of defined-benefit pension plans that guarantee specific payments and other benefits to workers when they retire.  \"The private sector plans are more likely to make fundamental changes to member benefits,\" AON said. \"Like corporate plans in other parts of the world, many Canadian sponsors have already closed or intend to close plans to new members, freeze accruals for existing members, and/or switch to a pension structure where more of the risks are borne by plan members.\"  At 75% of the publicly traded companies surveyed, at least one plan has been closed to new members, and 15% of the plan sponsors are considering freezing the defined benefit plan \"in the near future,\" according to AON.  Related  A pension freeze halts the accumulation of benefits from the point the plan is frozen, meaning the company or plan sponsor no longer has those obligations. It does not, however, eliminate benefits that have already been earned or accrued.  The sustained period of low interest rates combined with volatile capital markets has put funding pressure on pension plans that guarantee benefits to generations of workers who are living longer.  Among the ways plan sponsors can alleviate funding deficits is to raise contributions from plan members and sponsors, or reduce benefits.  The AON survey found that 71% of public sector plan sponsors are considering seeking additional contributions from members. The preference in the public sector is to make adjustments to benefits or cost structures that maintain \"the form\" of a benefit, but at a level that is more manageable for the plan sponsor, the pension consultant said.  The survey revealed that 43% of the entire pool of plan sponsors surveyed are \"curious about\" a new breed pension plan that shares the risk of pension promises between workers and employers.  The \"target benefit\" plans have fixed contributions and a targeted defined benefit level, but the funding and benefits policy prescribes methods for varying benefits based on affordability, according to AON Hewitt.  In other words, adjustments to both the costs and benefits are built in to respond to actual experience. Some benefits kick in only if the pension is doing well, so the plan can be sustained in hard times.  \"There is considerable interest in finding out more about the target benefit plan\\' concept, although it is a relatively new way to manage many of the risks inherent in traditional DB (defined benefit) and defined contribution plans and legislation is still outstanding in many jurisdictions,\" AON Hewitt said.',\n",
       " 'Shutdown Put Delay on Some Regulations The two-week government shutdown in October delayed the U.S. Department of Labor\\'s (DOL) work on the fiduciary redefinition, according to Assistant Secretary of Labor Phyllis Borzi.  Speaking to attendees at the 2013 American Society of Pension Professionals & Actuaries (ASPPA) Annual Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, Borzi said she cannot give a sure date when those regulations-which she called the \"conflict-of-interest\" rule-will be issued, but \"we are very close to finishing.\" She added that the rule is the DOL Employee Benefit Security Administration\\'s highest priority.  When the regulations are issued, Borzi said, it will include three parts:  * The preamble and text of the regulations;  * A \"robust\" economic analysis, in which the administration discusses what harm is done by conflicted advice, and including a cost/benefit analysis; and  * A list of exemptions.    Borzi also mentioned the administration\\'s advanced notice of proposed rulemaking about lifetime income projections on participant statements. It is now in the stage of analyzing comments. Many commenters urged the administration not to require projections on statements, but Borzi said, \"I don\\'t think that moves the needle, saying you can do it if you want.\"  Michael Rae, deputy chief of Negotiations and Restructuring at the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) told attendees his agency is working to ease burdens on pension plan sponsors, especially of small plans, to encourage continuity of the defined contribution retirement plan system. He mentioned regulations proposed in July on Premium Rates and Payment of Premiums that would simplify due dates, coordinate the due date for terminating plans with the termination process, make conforming and clarifying changes to the variable-rate premium rules, and provide for relief from penalties. According to Rae, the agency is in the process of reviewing comments (see \"Groups Recommend Changes to PBGC\\'s Premium Proposal\") and hopes to issue final regulations before time to pay 2014 premiums.  Rae also noted that the PBGC recently appointed a Participant and Plan Sponsor Advocate (see \"PBGC Names Plan Sponsor and Participant Advocate\"). However, there are no specific regulations yet about when and how to engage the advocate.  Mark Iwry, senior adviser to the Secretary of the Treasury and deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury, said his agency is hoping to issue hybrid plan regulations that have been in the works for so long. \"Due to the degree of technical issues with cash balance plans, it has taken longer than we thought,\" he stated, noting that when the regulations are issued, they will be final regulations.  Iwry told conference attendees the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) encourages stronger plan designs to increase retirement plan participation. He added that the agency encourages the use of automatic plan features not only in its regulations, but in speaking engagements.  The IRS has been working with the DOL to figure out how to expand lifetime income options in defined contribution plans. He invited attendees to offer remarks about how to design such options.',\n",
       " 'Permira trims hopes of £1.4bn valuation for Just Retirement The private equity backers of Just Retirement have trimmed their hopes of securing a £1.4bn valuation for the pensions business as they seek to attract investors to London\\'s latest listing.  As executives kicked off an investor roadshow on Tuesday, investment banks handling the offer began taking orders in a range that would give the Permira-backed company a market capitalisation of between £1bn and £1.25bn.  \"The idea is to have juice left for the next set of investors,\" said a senior investment banker. \"You want a good after-market.\"  Permira is proposing to sell between 5 and 10 per cent of its 84 per cent stake, significantly less than originally planned. The company is also planning to raise £280m worth of fresh equity after fees.  Just Retirement sells \"individually underwritten\" annuities, allowing individuals who are expected to die early - such as smokers - a higher-than-average annual pension income.  It is confident the market will continue to expand and is targeting fund managers that specialise in growth companies, not those looking for income. The company is expected to offer a dividend yield of only about 1 per cent.  On some financial metrics the midpoint of the valuation range would put shares in Just Retirement trading at a premium to its biggest rival, Partnership, which completed a £1.54bn flotation in June.  At the midpoint share price of 225p, Just Retirement would trade on about 13 times forecast 2014 operating earnings and 11 times 2015 earnings, said people familiar with the matter.  At the maximum price of 250p, it would trade on about 14½ times next year\\'s earnings and 12 times the following year\\'s. These prospective multiples are higher than Partnership\\'s, of about 12 times and 10 times respectively.  The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.  <>However, prospective investors said Just Retirement\\'s backers have been telling them the company would be priced broadly in line with the wider life insurance sector - even though it is expanding significantly faster.  They have also been arguing that Partnership is not necessarily a fair benchmark because its shares dropped more than 7 per cent on a single day last month for company-specific reasons.  Regulators found evidence suggesting that Partnership may have breached a new ban on commission payments to financial advisers. Partnership has said it would co-operate fully with the investigation.  Just Retirement\\'s backers have also been pointing out that the company, which also allows consumers to raise cash against the value of their properties through equity release schemes, has a higher embedded value than Partnership.  However, leading fund managers have warned they are sceptical about this insurance-specific valuation metric.  The price range has been set after advisers and sell-side analysts hired by Just Retirement sounded out prospective institutional investors. Conditional dealings are due to begin in about two weeks.',\n",
       " 'Features Final-salary pension did not help public servant\\'s family; First person Del-Ryan Rafter, an independent financial adviser at Beeston-based James Ryan Thornhill Ltd, on how poor health can raise your retirement income I WANT to look at two very unusual cases which highlight something we all should think about when we retire.  Firstly, Brian, who had a personal pension and was on the point of retiring. He came to us for pension advice and told us he had cancer, so we suggested an enhanced lifetime annuity. (This is a pension income which is increased because poor health is likely to shorten the client\\'s life).  Of course, we aren\\'t medically qualified and can\\'t judge the severity of an illness - we simply ask questions to detect signs of impaired health.  If we find a possible medical condition, no matter how trivial it seems, we gather as much detail as we can and send it to specialist annuity providers, as in this case.  As expected, the quotes offered more income than Brian would have got if he\\'d accepted his pension provider\\'s \"full health\" figure.  Typically, he was being offered around 50 per cent more - but one quote was so high we were sure there\\'d been a mistake.  It turned out that the provider\\'s medical adviser happened to be a consultant oncologist. He realised Brian\\'s cancer was an extremely aggressive form.  So, for the rest of his (tragically short) life, Brian enjoyed nearly five times more income than he expected.  Last year, Annette was retiring after a working life in the public service. She had the usual \"gold-plated\" final salary pension - 50 per cent of her final salary plus a large, tax-free lump sum.  Normally, no financial adviser would even think of interfering with such benefits. However, in this case, she mentioned recent treatment for cancer. It looked as if surgery and chemotherapy had been successful.  Nevertheless, I thought it might be worthwhile looking at an enhanced annuity. We were concerned that her pension would cease immediately if she were to die because she was divorced and her children were over 18.  One provider offered six per cent more income. Not a huge increase but, unlike her final salary pension, the lifetime annuity was guaranteed for ten years. She accepted.  Unfortunately, her cancer returned and she died only a few months after retiring. If she hadn\\'t spoken to us, her pension would have ended then and there. As it is, her family will receive the full annuity for the remainder of the guarantee - more than £125,000 spread over the next nine years.  These cases are exceptional - but they illustrate a wider truth. When you retire, you should think about your health. If it isn\\'t perfect - or if you smoke, drink or are overweight - talk to your financial adviser. We often surprise clients by enhancing their retirement income.  Failing health could open the door to much greater enhancement a few years later.',\n",

       " 'New Super Fund To Replace KiwiSaver $22 Billion Gravy Train Source: New Zealand First - Press Release/Statement:  Headline: New Super Fund To Replace KiwiSaver $22 Billion Gravy Train  A new superannuation fund to save billions of dollars for KiwiSaver contributors over the next thirty years will be a central plank for New Zealand First at the 2014 General Election.  An outline plan of \"KiwiFund\" has been announced by Rt Hon Winston Peters in his keynote Leader\\'s address at the party\\'s annual convention in Christchurch today.  Mr Peters told delegates that private funds managers were sucking the lifeblood out of KiwiSaver, and in five short years had already taken $325 million in management and investment fees.  \"Independent forecasts show that over the next thirty years these funds managers will take more than $22 billion from KiwiSavers and there is no government guarantee that the remaining funds will be safe.  \"There is huge pressure from the finance industry to get their hands on more retirement funds. The figures show these companies will make spectacular profits at the expense of people saving for their retirement.  \"Our plan is to change KiwiSaver so that it is a truly government-backed and managed retirement fund. Because of the economies of scale, and the elimination of hordes of ticket clipping fund managers, costs will be greatly reduced. People who pay into KiwiSaver will get their full return.\"  Under the New Zealand First plan, KiwiFund will be government-guaranteed and it would invest substantially in New Zealand.  \"People saving through KiwiFund will be buying back New Zealand. KiwiFund will invest in buying back farmland, state assets and critical infrastructure. Funding will also be provided to support smart local companies to develop new products and create jobs.  \"We have to invest in our own future. Overseas pension funds and corporate investors can hardly believe their luck - and are buying up everything they can in New Zealand.  \"New Zealand First says its time to stop this sell out. We are already well down the road to serfdom in our own country.\"  Mr Peters warned there would be \"howls of outrage\" from the private funds managers who would \"fight to the death\" to retain their $22 billion gravy train.  \"In the United States, private funds managers lost billions of dollars of pension funds during the 2008 financial crisis. We simply cannot afford to let that happen to the retirement savings of New Zealanders.  \"KiwiFund will enable us to build a high performance economy from which all New Zealanders will get the benefit,\" said Mr Peters.

       " 'Features Drive a hard bargain; HAVE PASSPORT WILL TRAVEL Jeremy Gates rounds up all the latest travel news TEMPERATURES are already falling in the Alps and if you want the price of your 2013/14 season ski holiday to fall too, driving to the slopes could be one easy solution.  With airlines ever-keen to slap hefty charges on extra baggage (something that is inevitable with a ski holiday) travelling by car could save families hundreds of pounds. Stuart McLeod of Zenith Holidays, an operator catering for \\'savvy\\' skiers, explains: \"This winter, we are seeing a significant increase in the number of people driving families to the slopes to cut costs. If we include free Channel ferry crossings, driving down to the Alps saves about £450 for a family of four, as opposed to flying and paying extra on baggage at check-in.\"  At lesser-known French resorts like St Jean Montclar and Les 7 Laux, for example, a family of four could enjoy a self-catering apartment with Channel crossings and lift pass from around a total £920 per week - or about £1,290 if they chose a four-star apartment with access to a pool (about £324 each).  McLeod says many skiers will also catch trains to the ski resorts this winter - some on Eurostar, and some catching trains direct to the Alps. These trains leave Paris at 10pm on Friday nights and arrive on the slopes next morning, allowing skiers to sleep on the train then grab an extra day\\'s skiing on the Saturday, a day which would otherwise be lost waiting around at airports.  Of course, not everyone can face the long car or rail trek across France, especially if you live further north, and for this reason Monarch Airlines has flights of barely two hours from Manchester, Gatwick and various regional airports into Italy, Spain, Germany and Austria. Monarch one-way flights into Munich, from Leeds Bradford, Luton and Manchester start at £39.99 (£83.98 return) with transfers to the resort of Kitzbuhel taking 90 minutes. Fares to Grenoble, from Birmingham, Leeds Bradford, Gatwick and Manchester start at £44.99 one way (£91.98 return) with transfers of two hours and 45 minutes to Val d\\'Isere. There is more good news from the big operators too, keen to secure early sales at discounted prices to avoid the risk of bigger discounts nearer departure date. For example, Crystal Ski, which covers 136 ski resorts in Europe, North America, Japan and Russia with regional departures from all major UK airports, offers a \\'buy one and get one half price\\' deal on lift passes - saving up to £177. It applies on bookings by October 21 for departures between January 4 and February 9.  Driving to your ski holiday can save you money.  At Ski Solutions, deals include savings on accommodation in Whistler, free lift passes and discounts in Verbier and four-night all-inclusive breaks at Isola 2000, from £575 includes return flights ex-Gatwick December 12.',\n",

Millions of working people are discovering the benefits of a workplace pension. This could include you if you\\'re employed, aged 22 or over, and earn at least £9,440 a year.  The law has changed so your boss has to enrol you into a pension scheme automatically, without you doing a thing!  It\\'s great news if you don\\'t have a head for figures or worry about making the wrong choices with your money.  If you\\'ve never thought about having a workplace pension before, it might sound complicated.  But it\\'s really a simple save-as-you-go system. Here\\'s how it works: Your employer will write to you, so look out for this letter, which will give you more details about your workplace pension scheme and what it means for you.  Your boss will then automatically enrol you into the scheme. Once you\\'ve been enrolled, a small percentage of your salary will go straight into your pension pot.  Your boss will pay in as well - that\\'s EXTRA money that you wouldn\\'t otherwise get. The government will give you tax relief, too.  All three contributors - you, your employer and the government - will continue to pay into your pension pot regularly.  Your pot will grow over time and when you retire, you will be able to use it to buy a regular income for the rest of your life.  You will have the chance to opt out of your workplace pension, but, before you do, here are some things to think about: The current State Pension is £110.15 per week for a single person. It\\'s a great foundation, but saving through a workplace pension will give you more money to spend in retirement.  Unlike other types of saving, you won\\'t be the only person paying in. Your employer and the government will contribute too - that\\'s not something you get with your ISA or savings account.  This isn\\'t just happening to you - more than a million people have already been enrolled into a workplace pension in the past year. Don\\'\\'t be the one to miss out!  This change started with the biggest companies first but will affect all businesses over the next few years.  Staying in a workplace pension could be the best decision you ever make. ?

       " 'Charge Cards vs. Debit Cards Not all plastic cards are created equal.  When discussing the kind of credit that comes with a plastic card, the first distinction to make is between charge cards and credit cards. American Express Green Card and Gold Card and Diners Club Charge Card are charge cards that require you to pay your bill in full each billing cycle. Most credit cards (including some offered by companies that also issue charge cards) don\\'t necessarily encourage you to pay your bill in full because they profit by charging interest -- lots of interest -- on the unpaid balance.  Charge cards. Travel and entertainment cards, such as American Express and Diners Club, are charge cards, not credit cards. You are expected to pay their bills in full within a specified time period. If you don\\'t, you\\'ll be penalized.  Membership fees for charge cards are higher than for bank-issued cards, and the kinds of service they offer -- an annual accounting of charges, traveler\\'s checks, cash in an emergency -- are commonly available with credit cards, too, especially gold or platinum cards.  You may be able to get a bigger credit line with a charge card, but they\\'re not as widely accepted as Visa or MasterCard.  Debit cards. A debit card appears to work the same way as a credit card: The merchant runs it through a little machine and off you go without any cash actually changing hands. But that\\'s where the similarity ends. When you use a debit card, the amount of your purchase is deducted from your checking account or some other account you have designated. It\\'s useful to think of a debit card as a paperless check that clears immediately, with no grace period, or \"float.\"  If you\\'re not paying close attention, you may find yourself carrying a debit card from your bank that you think is a credit card. That mistake usually lasts no longer than the arrival of your first bank statement showing your depleted balance.  The main use for debit cards used to be to get cash from automated teller machines, but devices known as point of sale terminals have been installed in an increasing number of retail outlets. Beginning in August (July for new accounts), your bank will ask if you want to opt-in for overdraft protection. If you don\\'t, your transaction will be declined. This will also occur at the ATM.  Two key facts to remember about debit cards:  Although they look like credit cards, they aren\\'t.  Safeguards against loss or theft and unauthorized use of your card aren\\'t as strict as they are with credit cards. By law, you\\'re liable for the same $50 as with a credit card, but only if you report an unauthorized transaction within two business days of discovering it. Miss that deadline and you\\'re legally responsible for up to $500. But MasterCard and Visa will waive it entirely in many cases.  Copyright 2013 The Kiplinger Washington Editors',\n",
       " 'Property New house sales build Signs of growth in new housing sales have emerged in NSW and Western Australia, the states with the biggest house price gains.  Nationally, new housing sales rose 3.4\\xa0per cent after a 4.7\\xa0per cent decrease in July, the Housing Industry Association\\'s seasonally adjusted figures, released on Tuesday, show.  However, new apartment sales fell\\xa011.2\\xa0per cent across the country after\\xa0new units sales eased in NSW and\\xa0Victoria.  \"It is no coincidence that the states where we\\'ve seen rises in new detached house sales are where we\\'ve seen the most price growth,\" HIA chief economist Harley Dale said.  New home sales were up 10.2\\xa0per cent in August for Western Australia and 7.4\\xa0per cent in NSW. South Australia also performed strongly, recording an 8.2\\xa0per cent increase.  Dr Dale said recovery was under way in those two states but overall sales were trending sideways when Sydney\\xa0and Perth were not included in the figures.  In Queensland, where new house sales inched up at 3.6\\xa0per cent, a housing recovery will not be as rapid.  \"It will be challenging and take time to gather momentum; it will be a grinding recovery in Queensland,\" he said.  In Victoria, new house sales fell 2.4\\xa0per cent.  Dr Dale said he expected further declines this financial year, as the state was still coming off peak growth in new home and apartment sales in 2010.  Improvements in Sydney have been seen in the housing and apartment market. However, there were fewer new unit sales in August.  Across the industry, builders and developers have noted an overall improvement in sentiment and inquiry\\xa0levels.  Home builder Metricon chief executive Mario Biasin said sales had improved in NSW, Queensland and South Australia but off very low bases.High demand expected to continue  He said regional Victoria was performing well but metropolitan Melbourne remained quiet.  \"We\\'re seeing more investors than first-home buyers at the moment, and people wanting to upgrade. More people are building now that they feel confident in selling their existing home,\" he said.  Years of under-supply in Sydney\\'s land market, coupled with strong population growth and low interest rates, are fuelling the market.  Cameron Holt, chief executive of Investa\\'s house and land arm, said the biggest challenge was maintaining the supply to the hungry Sydney market.  The unlisted land development arm of Investa Property Group has reported an increase in demand, particularly on Sydney\\'s fringe.  Mr Holt said demand had been high over the past six months, and he expected that to continue.  Medium and high-density projects continue to sell strongly in Sydney, such as Australand\\'s Metro project at Wolli Creek, where 55 of the 70 apartments sold at the September launch.

       " 'Bonds Gain As Shutdown Intensifies Debt-Ceiling Fears -- Barron\\'s Blog (This story has been posted on Barron\\'s Online\\'s Income Investing blog at http://blogs.barrons.com/incomeinvesting/)  By Michael Aneiro  Financial markets seemed cool with the whole government-shutdown thing yesterday but they\\'re not so happy about it today, and that\\'s pushing bonds higher. The ten-year Treasury note is up 14/32 in price to yield 2.594%, per Tradeweb data, and the 30-year bond is up 26/32 to yield 3.674%.  Of course, what everyone\\'s really worried about is the upcoming debt-ceiling negotiations, and whether the government can patch up its current, comparatively minor problems in time to address this much bigger potential problem of causing the U.S. to default on its debt. Here\\'s Deutsche Bank today:  On balance we expect moderate risk-off dynamics until resolution of both the budget impasse and the debt ceiling. The probability of even a technical default is extremely low, but the potential costs are very high. But in either event we expect the uncertainty to provide a short term tailwind to a consolidation of the summer\\'s sell-off. We remain comfortable with our year end forecast for 2.5% Treasuries, but a more acute scare in the budget and debt ceiling process could push yields still lower in the short run.  And here\\'s Peter Tchir of TF Market Advisors, underscoring what a calamity the debt-ceiling debacle would become if it led to a U.S. default by saying that it ain\\'t gonna happen:  There will NOT be a default on U.S. Treasury debt. It won\\'t happen because it has the potential to spin out of control. Even something that is \"technical\" and \"temporary\" could have ramifications for the market that no one will be willing to risk....  No matter what, we will pay our debts. Whether congress roles it weekly for a period of time, or we get a bigger solution, or the Treasury finds a way to pay people what is owed, the debt will be paid.  The potential consequences of not paying it are too great. It isn\\'t simple and at some point the majority of politicians will listen to people like Bill Gross and understand that the dangers of not paying are just too stupid to take. The system is too complex and at its heart is the understanding that treasuries are highly rated and always pay. Breaking that taboo opens too many possible scenarios for no good reason. This is after all debt and payment obligations that we have encumbered ourselves with through law, and should be paid.  I would never bet against the incompetence of Congress, but I am willing to bet against them being completely idiotic and acting with gross negligence, which is what it would take to trigger default on Treasury bonds.

       " \"Health Why divorce is bad for a man's health: Separation increases the risk of early death, substance abuse, suicide and depression * The impact of divorce on men's health 'needs urgent investigation'  * Divorced men are more likely to have heart disease, high blood pressure and strokes than married ones - are also 39% more likely to commit suicide  * They are more likely to take part in risky activities which also increases their mortality rate  Divorce might leave some with a broken heart but it also causes real health problems for men, according to researchers.  Those whose marriages end have higher rates of mortality, substance abuse and depression and often lack social support, a study found.  It called for doctors to refer more male divorcees to therapists and said more work is 'urgently needed' to investigate the damaging effects of relationship break-ups on their health.  American researchers say that divorced and single men\\xa0have a 39 per cent higher suicide rate than their married counterparts - perhaps in part because they are more likely to engage in risky behaviour.  The study, published in the Journal of Men's Health, calls for doctors to refer more men to therapists.  A case study by Dr Daniel Felix, of the University of Nebraska, said health professionals must recognise 'divorce related health problems' in men.  His research centred on a 45-year-old white man who 'endured a difficult divorce'.  He visited his family doctor for the first time in ten years complaining of bad sleep and persistent abdominal pain.  The man revealed he drank 'about a six-pack of beer a day,' had recently begun hating his job in middle management at a local bank and had become irritated with his colleagues and boss.  He eventually reported having limited access to his children and paying a 'significant amount of child support'.  The man also said his ex-wife 'took all our friends with her after the divorce'.  The researchers reported the man's physical condition as 'unremarkable' apart from having a slightly enlarged liver and being somewhat overweight.  They instead attributed his mild physical ailments and seemingly mild depressive state to continued anxiety and stress associated with his divorce.  As a result, the researchers warn doctors about treating ailments that have a psychological basis in divorce.  Instead, they recommend nutrition, exercise and sleep education.  They also urge medical professionals to refer men to alcohol and substance abuse treatment programmes, counsellors or other mental health professionals or divorce support groups.  Professor Ridwan Shabsigh, of Cornell University in the U.S. and president of the International Society of Men's Health, said: 'Popular perception, and many cultures as well as the media, present men as tough, resilient, and less vulnerable to psychological trauma than women.  'The fact is men get affected substantially by psychological trauma and negative life events such as divorce, bankruptcy, war and bereavement.  'Research is urgently needed to investigate the prevalence and impact of such effects and to develop diagnosis and treatment guidelines for practitioners.'\",\n",
       " 'FEAR FOR ELDERLY WITH MORTGAGE DEBT Fears have been raised for elderly people who are still sitting on large amounts of mortgage debt and could be at risk of losing their homes.  A report by Bristol University and the International Longevity Centre (ILC-UK) found that about two-fifths (40%) of people aged 75 and over and who still have a mortgage to pay off have an interest only mortgage with no linked investment with which to pay their loan back. This figure dropped to just 6% for people aged between 50 and 54 who still have a mortgage.  Interest-only mortgages, which allow borrowers to pay off the capital only when the mortgage term ends, have become much more thin on the ground since the boom years amid concerns about people not being able to pay back their debt.  Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that home owners have been failing to put enough money aside on up to half of the 2.6 million interest-only mortgages which are due for repayment over the next 30 years.  Mortgage lenders recently agreed to alert their most at-risk customers to help them avoid \"payment shocks\\'\\'. Some borrowers could end up having to sell their home to pay the loan back if they do not take stronger control of their repayment planning.  The Bristol University/ILC-UK research found that nearly one in 10 (9%) households headed by someone aged in their late 60s still had a mortgage to pay off, as did one in 50 (2%) of people aged over 80.  Among everyone aged over 50 with an outstanding mortgage, the average amount still owed was £62,200. Among the over 75s, the average amount outstanding was £30,900.  At least 14% of older mortgaged households had taken on a new home loan or extended their mortgage in the last couple of years, the report found.  The research was based on the Office for National Statistics\\' Wealth and Assets Survey, which looked at the economic wellbeing of households.  Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange Debt Charity, said: \"Today\\'s report further highlights the potentially serious problems faced by older people with interest only mortgages.  \"It is now essential that lenders show forbearance and work with customers to establish suitable options to prevent people from losing their homes in retirement.\"  Andrea Finney of Bristol University\\'s Personal Finance Research Centre, said: \"These new findings highlight a core of households whose mortgages have persisted into older age.\"  She said the report raises important questions about the financial security of these households as they approach later life.  David Sinclair, assistant director of policy and communications at ILC-UK said: \"We are seeing a worrying picture emerge of older people with unlinked interest only mortgages.  \"As the FCA and industry communicates with people with unlinked interest only mortgages, it should evaluate whether any specific targeting of information and advice is necessary for older people.\"  ends',\n",
       " 'News Don\\'t be afraid to ask the difficult questions that come with retirement planning Planning for retirement can be overwhelming. It requires thinking about long-term goals and it forces consideration of a more sensitive subject -- one\\'s own mortality.  An RBC study reports that only 52% of Canadian boomers actually put a plan on paper despite understanding its importance. However, they worry about it. According to a recent Investors Group survey, financial concerns affect 32% of Canadian couples and 60% of them put retirement savings worries at the top of the list.  For many Canadians, a sense of futility comes from thinking \"I\\'ll never be able to save enough money.\" They might be influenced by the old rule of thumb that suggests 70% of pre-retirement income is needed to maintain a current standard of living.  However, some experts like Fred Vettese, the chief actuary of Morneau Shepell, believe that figure is far too high.  Determining the right figure starts with analysis. Cash flow models should be performed, accounting for such factors as lump sum cash needs for special events, future inflation and debt reduction.  To help with that process, the government of Canada has created an excellent Canadian Retirement Income Calculator that takes into account such things as CPP, pensions, RRSPs and other sources of income like annuities.  Once income goals have been set, an analysis should be done to determine the income sources. For most people, a substantial portion will be drawn from investment portfolios. As retirement nears, these portfolios should be prepared for the transition and structured to replace employment income. This generally translates into a more significant weighting in fixed income as well as other investments that provide a regular income stream, such as high quality dividend-paying investments.  Good retirement income plans will also make use of guaranteed income sources that guard against volatile markets and inflation erosion. These include government benefits, available pension income and annuities.  Proper retirement planning goes beyond the management of the retirement portfolio. Estate planning also enters the picture, both from the perspective of how the money will be distributed to heirs but also to more sensitive personal issues. Often there is concern over the future management of the estate by the heirs who may not be competent with finances or are simply not ready to handle a large inheritance.  Canadians want to retire with sufficient income to carry them through and, hopefully, with enough to leave something for their children. However, if they allow themselves to be overwhelmed in angst over an unattainable figure that is both too high and inaccurate, they will never be motivated to begin saving. Determining the right number takes time, but the time is well spent.  -Kim Inglis, CIM, PFP, FCSI, AIFP is an Investment Adviser and Portfolio Manager with Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, a division of Canaccord Genuity Corp., Member -Canadian Investor Protection Fund. www.reynoldsinglis.ca.

The nearly 6,000-square-foot interior space is one of four duplex apartments with double-height living rooms and large terraces built on a setback at the Aldyn, Extell Development\\'s glassy 40-story luxury condominium on the Upper West Side. The apartment, No. 2102, listed for $16.9 million, was the pricier of two with private 15-by-37-foot outdoor pools and expansive Hudson River and city views that were unabashedly marketed in the name of charity. They were transformed into designer fantasy spaces last year for the 40th anniversary of the Kips Bay Decorator Show House, which raises money for the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club.  \"It raised a lot of awareness in the marketplace and certainly in the brokerage community of these residences, which are sort of fun and unexpected,\" said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which represented the building. \"Who expects to find a residence of nearly 6,000 square feet with a private pool in Manhattan?\"  But with this particular unit, the show house \"almost killed the deal,\" said Kristen Magnani of Rutenberg Realty, who represented the buyers, listed as Joseph and Maria Lucania in city records. Though the apartment met her clients\\' demands for a spacious urban abode with amazing views and outdoor space that rivaled their big suburban backyard, Ms. Magnani said, the show imposed the wildly different styles of the various designers, creating \"an absolute distraction.\"  \"It\\'s a hodgepodge of everything,\" she said, recalling red zebra wallpaper, an assortment of Venetian glazes on the walls, \"and every conceivable color you can imagine,\" throughout the apartment. Afterward, she added, \"they were like, \\'We don\\'t see ourselves living here.\\'\"  It wasn\\'t until the fancy furnishings were removed, the wallpaper and other designer imprints stripped out, and their own interior designer helped them conceptualize the space, that they began to envision themselves there, Ms. Magnani said. In the end, it was a combination of the unique space, the impressive views, and the many building amenities that sealed the deal.

       " \"Money Insurance is a risk when doing it yourself Super  Spend time watching commercial TV, listening to the radio or using the internet lately and you will have noticed the massive advertising campaign being conducted by the self-managed superannuation fund (SMSF) industry. It pushes the virtues, as the industry sees it, of managing your own super fund. And the message appears to be hitting home, with members of large super funds seemingly receptive to the messages from SMSF promoters.  A recent CoreData survey of members of large funds showed that less than one-quarter said they were likely to establish, or join, an SMSF in the next five years. CoreData found while most people with their own funds are in their 50s and over, the fastest-growing age cohorts of those starting their own fund are in their 30s and 40s. Who could argue with the ads asking whether we would like to take control of our super and that we should be paying lower fees? But just because they are being marketed in this way does not make them suitable for everyone.  Most people probably do not want to put in the time and effort required to run their own fund. Every time I write about SMSFs, warning to be careful, I receive emails from those who have their own funds, saying they have never looked back and the set-up is simpler to run than they had expected.  For some people, running their own fund does makes a lot of sense, and good luck to them. But while most people like the idea of control, they baulk at actually having to make investment decisions. And no matter who is hired to run the SMSF, it is the trustees of the fund who have the legal responsibility for the fund.  The best of the large funds charge total fees of about 1 per cent of the member's account balance. It would be a struggle to keep costs as low as that with an SMSF unless the fund holds a substantial amount of money.  Large funds are adding direct-investment options whereby members can buy shares and term deposits so that there are fewer reasons for members to strike out on their own. There are other potential problems of running a super fund. And members need to be clear about these before taking the plunge. Large funds usually provide cheap life insurance with automatic acceptance.  Trying to obtain insurance on your own will probably mean disclosing your medical history to the insurer and submitting to a medical examination. Insurance could be refused or you end up paying through the nose for it. There is some evidence that SMSF trustees are leaving some money in a large fund for the insurance. SMSFs are outside the superannuation compensation scheme. This is the scheme whereby all members of large funds have to pay a small levy to compensate those members of large funds who lose money because of fraud.\",\n",
       " 'Pensions Delaying pension income \\'is a gamble\\' Pensioners have been warned that they could lose out if they delay buying an annuity to try and qualify for a better rate.  Most retirees who are not members of final salary pension schemes have to purchase an annuity in order to convert their savings pot into an income for life, but rates have tumbled over recent years.  Once you purchase a standard annuity, the level of your income is fixed, so some savers have chosen to delay their purchase in the hope that rates will improve.  As the income you receive is linked to life expectancy, you are likely to qualify for a higher rate when you are older, which is another reason some choose to put off their annuity purchase.  But MGM Advantage, the annuity provider, said the outlook for annuity rates is uncertain and it may take retirees longer than they think to make up for the income they lose when delaying this purchase.  If you were to put off buying an annuity for two years and rates improved by 6 per cent over this period, it would take 19 years to make up for the income lost due to the delay.  If there was no improvement in annuity rates, it would take between 37 and 41 years to make up for the lost income, but life expectancy is just 21 years for a man aged 65 or 24 years for a woman.  A retiree with a £100,000 pension pot would be able to purchase an annuity worth £5,870 per year at 65, based on current rates.  At 67, he or she would qualify for an annuity income of £6,192 per year, based on the same amount of savings - but this would mean sacrificing £11,740 in income over two years.  Andrew Tully, of MGM, said: \"It has been said buying an annuity is a gamble. But then so is delaying your annuity purchase in the hope rates will improve.\"  The Association of British Insurers (ABI) last week published data showing the gap in annuity rates offered by its members in a bid to help pensioners compare costs.  Up to £1 billion per year is wasted by savers who do not shop around for the best deal, according to the Money Advice Service.  Many fall into the trap of accepting the rate offered by their existing pension provider, which is seldom good value.  Smokers and those who have health conditions may be able to qualify for enhanced rates which could boost their income by as much as 40 per cent.  Danny Cox, of Hargreaves Lansdown, the adviser, echoed the warning from MGM Advantage.  \"Those delaying buying an annuity in the hope that rates will improve may be disappointed,\" he said.  \"In most cases, people should buy their annuity when they need the income and not delay, unless they have other resources to live on.\"  Hargreaves Lansdown has a calculator tool to help you assess the impact of a delay.',\n",
       " 'Guardian Money Pages Money: Currency conversion is sky-high at Jet2 In June I booked a return flight from Malaga to Edinburgh with Jet2 airlines. The booking cost was displayed throughout in euros. At the end of the booking I was given the option to pay in sterling. I selected this and was given a sterling cost of pounds 538.83 for euros 548.84. I knew this wasn\\'t right but paid it rather than go through the booking process again. There is no option to go back to pay in euros once sterling has been selected. I assumed a mistake had been made and decided to contact Jet2 the next day to sort it out (I booked on a Sunday evening). When I realised just how much extra I had paid over the bank exchange rate I was furious. Using the bank exchange rate I would have paid pounds 466. That is a difference of approximately pounds 70. I contacted Jet2 by telephone the next day and was told that they have their own exchange rate and I would have to write to them to discuss my complaint.  Since then I have had two letters from them replying to my questions, but they say that because I agreed to the price at the time of booking I am not entitled to a refund of the exchange rate I incurred. I would be grateful if you could look into this for me and if I don\\'t get a positive outcome at least you could bring it to the attention of your readers.  MT, Ballater  You have been the latest victim of dynamic currency conversion, which is yet another way for the airlines to try to overcharge the unwary. In Guardian Money we have repeatedly warned against this practice, which is used by lots of retailers - particularly hotels and restaurants, and increasingly car hire and other firms that deal with tourists. Many ATMs in Spain offer this very pricey \"service\". The firm converts the local currency at an exchange rate that is beneficial to them - although not usually quite to this extent.  We asked Jet2 about your case and it chose not to explain why the overcharge was so high. Instead it says: \"Jet2.com uses a company exchange rate which changes daily with the fluctuations in currency values. Prices are displayed in both currencies throughout the booking process to ensure the conversion is clear. The customer makes the decision as to which currency they wish to pay in and has the option throughout the process of changing this.\"  We made a dummy booking and this was indeed the case. Next time, get the calculator out before you finish the booking. In your case it\\'s probably worth complaining to your card provider about this pounds 70 overcharge, which is ridiculous.  Meanwhile, other Jet2 customers take note, as should anyone abroad who is offered the chance to pay in sterling. You should always decline and insist on being charged in the local currency.',\n",

To meet that need for reliable income, Northwestern Mutual has introduced the Select(TM) Portfolio Immediate Income Annuity. This innovative new solution creates a base of guaranteed* lifetime income--much like a traditional pension--but has upside potential for that income to grow through dividends.*  By leveraging Northwestern Mutual\\'s financial strength and stability, dividend payouts have the potential to enhance the benefits for clients who can receive payments either as cash during retirement, keep dividends in the contract to increase their income stream, or select a combination of the two options. This growth potential is also available with the Select(TM) Portfolio Deferred Income Annuity, introduced in October 2012.  \"Retirement planning today is challenging, due to fewer employer-sponsored pension plans, market volatility and increased longevity. So our goal is to help create more certainty, security and predictability in retirement,\" says David Simbro, senior vice president of life and annuity products for Northwestern Mutual. \"And potential to grow one\\'s income through dividends is certainly appealing in today\\'s low interest rate environment.\"  Increasing longevity remains a key risk for those individuals without sufficient nest eggs, making financial security that much harder to achieve. According to current actuarial data, there is a 50 percent chance that a 65 year old man will live beyond age 87, and that a 65-year old woman will live beyond age 90. If married, there is a 50 percent chance that one will live beyond age 94. (Annuity 2000 Table)  \"This increasing longevity underscores why annuities fit so well into a comprehensive retirement plan, that includes both risk and investment solutions. Annuities can essentially create a paycheck for life,\" adds Simbro.  A strong response from the marketplace  Americans are seeking viable income solutions that can help create financial security and are designed to provide some protection from market fluctuations and inflation risk, which has resulted in significant growth in the deferred income annuity market. According to the 2013 Q1 LIMRA industry sales data, Northwestern Mutual\\'s market share increased to 24 percent, due in large part to the introduction of its new Select Portfolio Deferred Income Annuity. This is the company\\'s highest market share for annuity offerings to date.  \"We\\'re pleased to see so many people taking the steps necessary to create retirement plans that will safeguard their assets and protect their future,\" notes Simbro.  *All guarantees in annuities are backed solely by the claims paying ability of the issuer.

In its sole recordkeeping model, SBCTC can also provide employees with a comprehensive view of all the assets in their retirement plan, which gives employees the ability to make better decisions regarding their investment mix, risk profile and portfolio rebalancing.  SBCTC employees will also have access to TIAA-CREF financial advisors, who provide retirement advice at the fund level tailored to individual goals at varying life stages as compared to other retirement plan vendors who can only offer guidance at the asset class level. By combining sole recordkeeping and financial advice, plan members may benefit because sole recordkeeping provides them with a comprehensive picture of their retirement plan assets, which they can use in conversations with a TIAA-CREF financial advisor to help build a successful retirement investment strategy.

       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING Record sums poured into leveraged loan funds Global investors are committing money to the leveraged loan market in record volumes, even after 58 straight weeks of inflows, chasing an asset class seen offering both a high yield and protection from big market swings.  More than $40bn has now flowed into loan funds this year, according to EPFR Global, including a record $2.18bn in the week ended this Wednesday.  Loan funds buy floating rate bank loans to big companies, especially high-leveraged companies owned by private equity firms.  While equity investors occasionally took fright at signs the global economy may be flagging, and bond investors took flight when stronger economic data suggested the Federal Reserve will wind down monetary easing, leveraged loans have marched onward in all weathers.  Fifty-eight weeks is the longest uninterrupted streak of positive inflows since Lipper began collecting weekly data on the asset class in 2003.  Eric Gross, credit strategist at Barclays, said the attractions of loan funds include the fact that leverage loans get a higher priority than bonds if a company goes bankrupt.  The floating rate also means that they will not sell off as sharply as fixed-income investments when interest rates rise.  With an effective yield that Barclays calculates at 5.8 per cent, loans offer close to the same yield as junk bonds, which currently yield 6.1 per cent on a Barclays average. \"You get a similar yield and you have less downside risk,\" said Mr Gross.  Loan funds remain a smaller asset class than fixed income and equity funds, where there were also strong inflows in the past week.  Overall, EPFR Global-tracked bond funds took in a nine-week high of $4.36bn, while equity funds absorbed $8bn.  In particular, US high yield bond funds posted their second biggest weekly inflow on record, according to EPFR, rebounding from June\\'s Federal Reserve-related sell-off.  \"The [leveraged loan fund] asset class is one of the few for whom rising interest rates are a plus,\" EPFR analysts wrote this week. \"But, given the appetite for exposure to junk bonds, fears of a sharp hike in the cost of capital - especially in the US - are receding.\"  The all-weather appetite for leveraged loans has been a boon for companies that were taken private near the peak of the credit bubble six years ago, since it has provided money with which to refinance maturing or onerous debt.  In a report this week, Fitch, the credit rating agency, estimated that of the $970bn of loan issuance over the last four quarters, approximately 66 per cent has been directed towards loan refinancing.  The report said that the biggest threat to the creditworthiness of highly-leveraged companies had been \"all but eliminated\" by the issuance.  The total amount of debt due through the end of 2015 had been reduced from a high of $1.2tn at the beginning of 2011 to $440bn at June 28, 2013, Fitch said.',\n",
       " 'Barron\\'s Blog:UBS: Precedent Favors Bondholders In Detroit Bankruptcy (This story has been posted on Barron\\'s Online\\'s Income Investing blog at http://blogs.barrons.com/incomeinvesting/ )  By Michael Aneiro  UBS muni strategists may not specifically call Detroit\\'s bankruptcy \"idiosyncratic\" (opting for the less-punchy \"we do not consider Detroit\\'s plight to be evidence of a systemic event at this time\") but they address at length a key concern for bondholders: how the city\\'s emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, is effectively challenging the status of general obligation bonds, and how bondholders might fare in this court case. From UBS muni analysts Thomas McLoughlin, Kathleen McNamara and Kristin Stephens:  [Orr] classified all GO bonds as unsecured obligations, making no distinction between GO bonds backed by a promise to levy an unlimited property tax and GO bonds lacking such a pledge. The net effect was to place all GO ULT bonds (other than those additionally secured by a state intercept payment) on par with all general fund obligations, including pension liabilities and post-employment retirement benefits.  Mr. Orr presumably plans to argue that the bankruptcy court should ignore the important distinctions among different types of general bonds and, instead, conclude that no statutory lien exists for the protection of any GO bondholder. Such an argument would have to contend with the fact that local governments in Michigan are required to levy a dedicated property tax for the repayment of voter- approved debt. The local government is then statutorily required to segregate the property tax proceeds in a separate account for the exclusive benefit of bondholders. This is hardly the definition of a bond \"without any legal security.\"  We believe this issue -- the degree to which a GO ULT bond constitutes a \"secured\" obligation -- represents one of the most significant issues associated with the city\\'s bankruptcy. There are few legal precedents (owing to the rarity of municipal bankruptcies). The precedents that do exist would appear to favor holders of GO bonds backed by an unlimited property tax. Moreover, nearly 90% of Detroit\\'s outstanding debt is enhanced by municipal bond insurance policies. These insurers have a vested interest in protecting the sanctity of GO ULT debt. In the event the bankruptcy court decides in favor of Mr. Orr\\'s arguments, we foresee further appeals and lengthy litigation.  UBS then looks at the city\\'s roughly $5.4 billion of bonds backed by a special revenue pledge, such as water and sewer bonds, which constitute 69% of the city\\'s muni debt:  In contrast to the uncertainty over the security of the city\\'s general obligation bonds, Detroit\\'s water and sewer enterprise debt is classified as \"secured\" in the Proposal. While the paucity of municipal bankruptcies over time leaves us with few precedents, we believe the court will recognize that utility revenues constitute special revenues and are, therefore, insulated from the city\\'s insolvency.

       " 'Financial Post Investing TSX crests after six weeks; U.S. indexes also surge; Housing starts stable, inspiring confidence The TSX hit a six-week high Thursday amid analyst speculation the worst may be behind beleaguered Canadian stocks.  The composite index closed up 61.57 points, or 0.49%, to 12,630.34 on a day when U.S.  indexes reached new record highs. But the TSX is still a long way off from its record close above 15,000 in 2008 and it\\'s lagging its U.S. equivalents for the third year running.  A commodity price rout, concerns about a slowing housing market in Canada and slackening demand from China have combined to essentially punch Canadian stocks in the gut.  Martin Roberge, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, doesn\\'t expect any of those pressures to disappear, but \"recent economic data in Canada and in China suggest that there is less uncertainty around and/or a lessening of those risk factors.\"  Data from China this week showed its gross domestic product grew by 7.5%, meeting expectations and easing fears that the country\\'s economy is on the verge of a hard landing.  Mr. Roberge also pointed out Canadian housing starts are averaging 200,000 a month this year, adding some confidence about the health of Canada\\'s economy.  Meanwhile, BMO Capital Markets\\' latest commodity report said this year\\'s pricing pullback, which has hit the resource-heavy TSX hard, is likely to reverse next year.  \"The correction has likely been overdone in some areas, and commodities should stabilize and recover moderately through 2014 as global growth regains momentum,\" said Earl Sweet, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets.  Mr. Roberge said he sees four reasons why the worst may be over for the TSX. First, technicals have improved, with the stock-to-bond ratio pushing above its 200-week average.  The last two times that happened, in September 2004 and december 2010, Canadian stocks outperformed bonds over the following months.  Second, foreign securities data from Statistics Canada show Canadian stock flows are improving relative to bond flows. More importantly, the data hints foreign buyers are interested in Canadian equities again.  Third, the analyst notes that 55% of the TSX market cap is now paying a dividend yield of at least 3%, compared with 52% in the last market bottom in 2009. That suggests the index is due for a rebound, he said.  Finally, there are signs the TSX materials sector, which is about one-third of the index, has also bottomed out. A report by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch on Thursday notes the sector is one of the most oversold in the world, with a deviation of 34.3 from its 200-day moving average. Only global gold miners and South African materials are more oversold.  \"The TSX material sector is down 49% from its peak in April 2011,\" Mr. roberge said, adding that a similar derating in valuation multiples signalled cyclical sector bottoms in 2005 and 2008.',\n",
       " \"Personal Finance Funds for Investors Seeking Income; Investments include REITs and emerging markets With traditional bonds yielding 2% or less, rather than the 5% they averaged between 1926 and 2012, financial advisers and investors have been trying to cobble together assets for income-often paying more and hunting in far-flung corners of the market. Recent signs the Federal Reserve may taper its bond purchases brought on volatility that further complicates the income conundrum.  The fund industry has come up with solutions, launching roughly 100 funds using multiple assets and generating income since 2010 that have drawn $26 billion in assets, according to Lipper.  Many of these funds charge hefty upfront loads and are difficult to categorize, with managers often switching in and out of assets. Some focus on yield or current income while others are more concerned with capital appreciation and dividend growth.  But for investors looking to diversify across income assets like master limited partnerships, dividend-paying stocks and emerging-market debt, they may be worth a look.  Here are five funds that yield more than the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index average and boast strong records over at least the past three years.  The 65-year-old Franklin Income fund (FKINX) invests primarily in stocks, bonds, convertible bonds and real-estate investment trusts. Income is the major focus, with capital appreciation a close second. The fund yielded 6% over the trailing 12 months and returned an average return of 7.6% over the past decade. Its overseas exposure is capped at 25%.  Thornburg Investment Income Builder fund (TIBAX) is more global, with almost half its assets abroad. It has flexibility in its allocations, going where it can find the best mix of capital appreciation, income and price. The fund, which yielded 5.7% over the past 12 months and returned an average 9.8% over the past decade, typically sticks with stocks, bonds and convertible bonds.  JPMorgan Income Builder fund (JNBAX) also has a global bent and even more flexibility, investing in agency mortgage bonds (mainly Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issues), dividend-paying emerging-market stocks and, recently, Italian and Spanish government debt. The fund yielded 4.9% over the trailing 12 months and returned an average annual 8% over the past five years.  BlackRock Multi-Asset Income (BAICX) has similar flexibility but focuses more on risk. The fund returned an average annual 7% and yielded 4.5% over the past five years. It aims for as much or less risk as a 50% stock/50% bond portfolio, often using cash or hedges.  The MFS Diversified Income fund (DIFAX) invests in high-yield bonds, emerging-market debt, U.S. government debt, U.S. value stocks and REITs. The fund must always have exposure in each but can tilt weightings slightly from a neutral posture of 60% bonds and 40% stocks and REITs, with the most latitude in high-yield bonds. The fund averaged an annual 8.7% over the past five years and yielded 3%.\",\n",
       " 'News Unhappy with property taxes? Then call MPAC KIRK DICKINSON For The Daily News  Chatham-Kent residential property owners may have received a shock when they opened their tax bills this past week.  Due to a number of variables, including recent property reassessments, many residents have seen a significant increase in this year\\'s property tax.  This past spring, the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation (MPAC) performed a general reassessment of all Chatham- Kent property, which South Kent Coun. Art Stirling said is a major reason why taxes are costlier than many residents anticipated.  He said if residents have had a significant increase in their assessment beyond the average property tax increase, then they will see a higher-than-average tax increase.  \"The assessed value of your home or property should be relatively what you think you could get for it on the open market,\" said Stirling, who served as budget chairman. \"If you disagree with MPAC\\'s assessment, then you can ask for a review.\"  Gord Quinton, acting director of financial services/treasurer for the municipality, said there have been hundreds of complaints from residents who are upset about the increase in their tax bills.  However, he said there are some residents who have actually seen a decrease in their property tax this year if their assessment was lowered. He said many residential property owners saw varying assessment changes.  \"Some went way up and some went way down. There\\'s people with 20% increases in their assessment and people with a 20% decreases,\" said Quinton.  He said farmland assessments in general have increased by about 65%.  Stirling said he\\'s heard of many residents requesting an appeal of their assessment, as well as a great deal of success having their assessment reduced.  \"I would encourage people to take a look at their reassessment and if they disagree with the new assessed value on their property, they probably should visit with MPAC,\" he said.  Stirling added that a number of factors can affect a residential property assessment -- including location, neighbouring property sales, urban costs, size of the property, age of the residence and building quality.  \"All municipalities live with the consequences of that reassessment, which is happening every four years,\" he said.  Another contributing factor in the increase in property taxes was the 1.2% education -evy reduction that was passed as part of council\\'s budget process.  Stirling said many members of council, including himself, were initially unclear that the 1.2% reduction was primarily applied to commercial and industrial property, rather than residential.  This had led to an average increase of 4.4% in property taxes, rather than the expected 3.2% tax hike.  He said another contributing factor is the loss of industrial assessment.  \"If we see a reduction in industrial, then that tax shifts somewhere. And in this particular case this year, a lot of that has shifted to residential,\" he said  With the budget passed in February, the hike works out to an added $79 for a $153,000 home.',\n",
       " 'DOUBLE-DIP PENSIONS TO BE TARGETED SUPER-SIZED CUTS Anyone who is a New Zealand resident and has been living here for at least 10 years is entitled to state superannuation when they turn 65.  More than 570,000 people received $9.5 billion in New Zealand Super last year, with the number expected to continue to grow as the population ages.  The payments can be as much as $357.42 a week, with couples paid less.  Of these, about 65,000 people have their payment cut because they receive some money from an overseas pension scheme.  --------------------  An already unpopular scheme to cut Kiwi pensions is being expanded, with the retired being pushed to hit up other countries for money first.  Faced with a growing elderly population, the Ministry of Social Development is targeting tens of thousands of newly retired people, urging them to apply for overseas state pensions - and save the Government millions.  The scheme is meant to prevent double-dipping, with $1 docked from New Zealand Super for every $1 received from overseas. The deductions apply even to a spouse of someone who receives an overseas pension.  The ministry will spend an extra $12 million over the next five years on the expanded pension- deduction plan, which it estimates will save the Government at least $49m and help pay for its $300m welfare shake-up.  The long-standing scheme, which dates back to 1938, already docks the Super payments of about 65,000 people receiving overseas state pensions, saving the Government about $237m a year. Most are from the eight countries with which New Zealand has a social security agreement, including Britain, Australia, Canada and Ireland.  But the scheme is unpopular with pensioners, and associate professor Susan St John, of Auckland University\\'s retirement policy and research centre, has described it as \"archaic\" and \"deeply inequitable\".  Budget documents published last week show the scheme will now be expanded, partly because it is seen as an easy way to free up money to fund welfare reform.  \"Easy options of saving have been largely exhausted,\" the papers say. \"Unlike many other potential saving initiatives, the overseas pension collection initiative is available under current policy settings.\"  Social Development Minister Paula Bennett has been overseas in recent days, holding talks about extending pension portability schemes. She signed an agreement with Malta on Monday, and said she had also talked to her counterpart in Croatia.  The papers show the extra money for the ministry will be spent on 29 more staff to help people living in New Zealand apply for overseas pensions, and on a new IT system that will test an extra 10,000 new superannuitants a year.  Ministry senior services general manager Arthur Grooby said that, as the baby-boomers reached 65, the drain on New Zealand Super would rise. More money was needed to fairly test the entitlement of thousands of new superannuitants to ensure they were claiming any money they could from overseas schemes. This was a legal requirement.

       " 'News More people are getting caught by inheritance tax; ADVERTISING FEATURE Independent financial advice P Wealth & Investment reports that the amount of inheritance tax paid in the UK increased from £2.72bn in 2010/2011 to £2.91bn in 2011/12 and the number of individuals paying the tax also rose by 3,000, with a total of 20,000 estates becoming liable to the `death tax.\\' He says families are liable for a 40% inheritance tax bill on everything they inherit above the current `nil-rate band` of £325,000, although the allowance is doubled for married couples.  Paul says the current nil-rate band was set to increase to £329,000 this tax year; however, the Government has frozen the allowance until April 2018, which means even more people will be caught in the inheritance tax net.  He reveals: Indeed, according to estimates by the Office of Budget Responsibility, inheritance tax liabilities are set to rocket by an astonishing 40% by 2018 as a result of this measure.  Inheritance tax is undoubtedly a punitive tax, yet it is commonly referred to as a voluntary tax as it can be legitimately avoided with judicious financial planning.  \"People need to be proactive in managing their financial affairs if they want to pass on their wealth intact.\"  So what can you do? Paul says there are a number of different steps that can be taken. One option is to give away a capital sum; however, you must survive for seven years after the date of the gift in order for it to avoid inheritance tax.  The person making the gift must also consider whether they can actually afford to lose access to that capital sum along with any income (such as dividends or interest) that is being generated by that capital, as they would not be able to retain any right to benefit from it in the future.  He continues: There are, nevertheless, a number of approved trust schemes that can help you to circumvent this particular problem.  For example, if you have investments that are being used to provide income then consideration could be given to wrapping all or part of those investments in a particular type of trust that will remove the portfolio out of the inheritance tax equation after seven years whilst still allowing you to draw an income from the underlying investments.  \"Access to the capital in this type of trust would be lost, so it would be prudent to maintain liquidity outside the trust.\"  Paul adds that there are numerous other methods of mitigating inheritance tax, including holding investments which would qualify for Business Property Relief which generally will avoid inheritance tax after a two year holding period.  Quite often, it will be prudent to blend together various different solutions to achieve the required outcome. Professional advice should always be taken. ?

       " 'DJ Electronics Giants Push Back Against Kodak Retiree Deal Many of the world\\'s biggest names in electronics and technology, from Canon to LG to Microsoft, are pushing back against the landmark deal Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) struck to resolve $2.8 billion in U.K. pension claims.  More than a dozen companies on Thursday filed court papers outlining their objections and concerns to a deal that Kodak calls the \"centerpiece\" of its restructuring: the transfer of its personalized-imaging and document-imaging businesses to its U.K. pensioners.  The deal, which covers such Kodak products and services as cameras, retail photo-printing kiosks and scanners, will not only resolve the $2.8 billion in U.K. pension claims but will also bring in $650 million in cash and noncash consideration to Kodak\\'s bankruptcy estate.  The companies that filed objections say they don\\'t have a problem with the idea of Kodak selling those businesses to its retirees, but they do have a problem with how they and the various agreements they have with Kodak--including patent license agreements--will fare in the sale.  \"In their sale motion...the debtors repeat and expand upon aggressive strategies that they have employed in prior sale motions in this case,\" Nikon Corp. (NINOY, 7731.TO) said in its objection. \"The sale motion, which is ambiguous, overreaching, and lacks adequate protection for parties-in-interest, misuses the plan and proposed order to the potential detriment of parties-in-interest, including Nikon.\"  Nikon\\'s objection, which many of the other companies joined in, points out the deal\\'s lack of protection for the companies\\' rights as well as the possibility that their agreements could be transferred to the pension plan without their consent or without paying off any amounts owed under them.  Among the companies joining in Nikon\\'s concerns are Intel Corp. (INTC), International Business Machines Corp. (IBM), LG Electronics Inc. (066570.SE), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Nokia Corp. (NOK). Other objections came in from Canon Inc. (CAJ, 7751.TO ), Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ), Imax Corp. (IMAX) and Sony Corp. (SNE, 6758.TO).  According to Kodak, however, the deal is \"essential\" to its ability to restructure.  \"The debtors believe there is no foreseeable alternative to resolve these liabilities more favorably for the debtors than the [pension plan] global settlement,\" the company said in court papers.  The U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan will consider the deal, and the objections to it, at a hearing next Thursday.  Kodak, of Rochester, N.Y., sought Chapter 11 protection in January 2012. It is hoping to exit bankruptcy later this year under a restructuring plan that, in addition to incorporating the U.K. pension deal, would hand control of the company to its bondholders.

       " 'Wealth Management (A Special Report) --- Armed for the Future: Gun Trusts Help Owners Legally Pass Down Firearms Who gets the guns after you\\'re gone?  Lawyers say a growing number of firearms owners are creating special gun trusts, which are designed to allow collectors to share and pass down firearms to loved ones without inadvertently breaking any laws. The trusts also make it easier for gun enthusiasts to procure certain restricted firearms, such as suppressors, because of a quirk in federal regulations.  Interest in these trusts is growing, lawyers say, after a series of recent mass shootings brought responsible gun ownership into the national conversation. That\\'s because gun trusts, if drafted properly, may offer gun owners and their heirs some protection from future laws placing restrictions on gun ownership, they say.  \"What\\'s happening recently has really changed the landscape\" of firearms planning, says David Goldman, a Jacksonville, Fla., lawyer, who helps clients set up gun trusts.  Even without the specter of stricter gun-control legislation, however, a complex patchwork of federal and state gun laws makes it easy for gun owners and their families to get into legal trouble when transferring or taking possession of firearms, especially restricted ones. A gun owner, for example, may not realize that an heir who is a legal medical marijuana user may be prohibited from owning a firearm under federal law. Creating a trust, a legal entity that holds the guns and is managed by a trustee (typically the gun owner) for beneficiaries, can help owners properly navigate this thicket of rules.  Having a trust is \"a responsible way of owning a firearm,\" says Mr. Goldman. It \"provides a set of rules for how you want your assets to be managed during your life, and in the event of your incapacity and beyond,\" he says.  Meanwhile, because of a legal loophole, collectors can buy certain restricted firearms, such as machine guns and short-barreled rifles, through trusts without having to get the approval of a local law-enforcement officer, like individual buyers do. Many gun trusts, in fact, are created for this purpose, says Dennis Brislawn, a Kirkland, Wash., lawyer who has drafted hundreds of gun trusts for clients.  A spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives , the federal agency enforcing gun laws, says that applications to transfer restricted firearms to trusts or corporations has grown rapidly in recent years, to 39,354 last year from 26,376 a year earlier. He says the agency is reviewing a proposal to make firearms purchased through trusts subject to the same requirements as guns bought by individuals.  Setting up a gun trust can range from several hundred dollars to about $2,500 in lawyers\\' fees. Online gun-trust forms can be purchased for less than $100, but users should make sure they are compliant with federal and state laws.  ---  Ms. Silverman is a Wall Street Journal staff reporter in Austin, Texas.

       " 'Money Autonomy offers a taste of control Getting started  The growing SMSF market, which accounts for almost half a million funds with $496.2 billion in assets under management, has concerned the mainstream superannuation funds - both retail and industry - for years.  Having seen members leave to start up their own self-managed super funds, many are now providing \"member-directed options\", through which members can choose to tailor a suite of shares, fixed-income investments or other listed investments.  These are not entirely new. Ten years ago, one of the predecessors of AustralianSuper, the Australian Retirement Fund, launched an option that enabled members to invest in the top 100 ASX-listed shares.  The $12 billion HOSTPLUS has also signalled that it will launch a member-directed option by the end of the year.  The company\\'s executive manager of strategy and marketing, Umberto Mecchi, says: \"It\\'s for those who are probably seeking some increased control.  \"Our demographics show we\\'ve got a large number of members who are young, but we also have a very wealthy cohort in the over-50s section ... We just want to make sure [we cater to them]. The SMSF [growth] has demonstrated there is some popularity about people wanting to take control.\"  Legalsuper has teamed up with Macquarie Bank to offer a direct-investment option, while many other funds, such as the $7 billion AUSCOAL, are also working on options.  Whether the extra flexibility will stop members leaving to start up SMSFs is unclear, but most funds that offer them believe they can\\'t afford not to.  AUSCOAL chief executive Bruce Watson says although it has little leakage to SMSFs, it wants to give members more control if they choose it. \"The more engaged our members get, the more control they want.\"  Sunsuper is one fund that doesn\\'t believe its members are crying out for such an option just yet.  \"We hold the view that it\\'s not going to stop members from going to SMSFs,\" says Teifi Whatley, Sunsuper\\'s general manager of customer experience and insights. \"Our research with our members has not suggested that it\\'s a key priority.\"  Perhaps HOSTPLUS sums it up best when it calls it \"SMSF lite\".  These self-directed options give members some choice - and definitely at a lower cost than a full-scale SMSF - but they don\\'t provide the same level of investment flexibility. For example, you won\\'t be able to invest in single-asset property or artworks. But if you are becoming more engaged and want to exercise some control over your retirement savings, the new options offer a good trial run.  If things don\\'t work out, it\\'s much easier to transfer your funds back into a prescribed investment option within the fund. And if, through a taste of autonomy, you realise that running a fund by yourself isn\\'t as easy as it might appear, perhaps that\\'s a good thing.  David Potts is on leave.',\n",
       " \"Barron's Blog: Really This Time: Junk Bonds Seen Paying 'Coupon' Return in 2013 (This story has been posted on Barron's Online's Income Investing blog at http://blogs.barrons.com/incomeinvesting/.)  By Michael Aneiro  It's a bit of a case of adjusting a forecast to catch up with reality, but Barclays just recently upped its 2013 junk-bond total return forecast to 6-8% from 4-6% (the market's already taken care of 5.45% of that). A bit more interesting is Barclays' look at the history of junk-bond annual returns, which famously never come close to the market's average coupon in any given year, typically undershooting or overshooting based largely on external factors.  Indeed, the Barclays U.S. High Yield Index has remarkably never returned between 6% and 10% (generally the junk-bond average yield range) in its 23-year history. BUT: that may just be a quirk of the Gregorian calendar, as Barclays finds that calculating twelve-month returns beginning in any other month besides January makes junk bonds far more predictable. Treasury rates play an unexpectedly big part too, and those are expected to be unusually muted this year. More from Barclays credit strategists Brad Rogoff, Eric Gross and Mike Kessler:  Even more important than the starting date has been the effect of rates on returns.... Over our 23-year sample period, the average high yield return was 11.2%. Of this, only 4.5% came in the form of excess returns, meaning 60% of total returns came from the Treasury component, on average. In fact, only three years have had total returns that were less than excess returns, meaning a move higher in Treasury yields hampered returns. Digging even deeper, five years have had excess returns between the magical 6% and 10% levels, but each time, a significant boost from Treasuries pushed the total above the 10% threshold.  So far, 2013 total and excess returns are essentially equal at 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively. We believe that a combination of a lack of rate volatility (the past week notwithstanding) and subdued credit volatility could produce 2013 returns that are the closest to coupon that we have ever seen in high yield. As a result of the increased reach for yield and our rates team's forecast that Treasuries will be little changed at year-end, we are raising our total return forecast from 4-6% to 6-8%. The middle of our range would see the market ending the year closer to a 5.5% yield to worst, as opposed to the current record low of 5%. We do not view this as bearish at all, but with fund flows slowing, corporate releveraging increasing, and the specter of a change in Fed policy as we approach year-end, it will be tough for high yield to hold on to all of its gains.      -For continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at http://wsj.com.

       " 'Local Silverman: Compare federal, family budgets What if the U.S. government were a family? You may have seen the analogy floating around the last couple of years comparing the debt and income of the U.S. government to that of an average family. How does the nation\\'s budget compare to the standard family? Let\\'s have fun with this example again.  Our fictitious family, the Joneses, earn $100,000 a year. Even though $100K a year is a nice income, our family spent over $135,000 last year, which means they borrowed the additional $35,000. Unfortunately, this is not the first time the Joneses borrowed to maintain their lifestyle. In fact they have about $500,000 in debt already.  So the Joneses (like our government) have recently adopted some cost-cutting measures. But the cost-cutting amounted to a little over $1,000 a year. That doesn\\'t make much of a dent into their overspending and its impact on their total debt load is almost nonexistent.  If this was your family budget, you\\'d probably be freaking out. You wouldn\\'t argue whether you needed to cut spending or increase income you\\'d do both. You know it\\'s painful. You know there is no way around it. You know it will take a long time. And those promises you made the family about paying for college; that vacation in Hawaii; and your retirement dreams - well, prepare for disappointment.  Of course, when it comes to the Fed and their budget, the money they \"make\" (income - mostly from taxes) isn\\'t spent on themselves. Instead, they have a family business and, as citizens, we are their customers. As a service to us, they help us make more money (jobs, worker training, child care, and infrastructure); thereby increasing the amount of money they get in return from those taxes. That is why there is a good argument to spend even more money on us (stimulus) to generate even more income.  The danger is they may not make back their investment; they may run out of money before the income starts to come in, and they already are spending a lot. If our Joneses were spending money on their kids\\' education with hopes of higher income to help out with their debt, they may have the same problems (the biggest being getting the kids to pay their parents back).  Of course the federal budget differs considerably from a household budget. A family has an eventual end to their earnings, while a country lives many, many generations. Our country is also in a good position to borrow a lot of money at very good rates. And the Fed can even make more dollars if they want to (quite illegal for a family to do).  Still, most of the family budget analogy works.

       " 'Climate Change; Vancity Mortgage Offer Helps Its Members Partner in the Fight Against Climate Change 2013 MAY 17 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Real Estate Weekly News -- With spring home-buying underway, Vancity is offering a limited-time rebate of $2,000 to homebuyers who make energy-efficiency upgrades to their houses and bring a new mortgage to or re-advance or refinance an existing mortgage with Vancity.  \"We believe Vancity\\'s Home Energy Rebate reflects shared values between Vancity and our members around environmental sustainability,\" says Rick Sielski, chief operating officer of member services at the credit union. \"The offer invites members to work together with us to help deal with climate change. Vancity can\\'t do it alone.\"  Sielski says Vancity is committed to including environmental principles in its business operations, including service to its members, as well as showing leadership on the issue in the community. \"The home-energy rebate offer is just one example of that commitment,\" he says.  To help Vancity administer the Home Energy Rebate offer, FortisBC and Vancity are working together, with Vancity leveraging the FortisBC rebate process. Eligible FortisBC rebates include installing energy-efficient water heaters, fireplaces, furnaces or boilers. A rebate towards the cost of switching from oil-based or propane home heating to natural gas is also eligible.  \"This offer is one more way of helping British Columbians save energy and money,\" says Sarah Smith, director of energy efficiency and conservation with FortisBC. \"For example, customers may see yearly savings on their natural gas bill by upgrading a standard efficiency furnace to a high-efficiency natural gas model or by switching their water heater from a medium sized tank to a tankless heating system.\"  The offer applies to qualifying Vancity mortgages signed between May 1 and August 15, 2013. Vancity members must apply for the Vancity rebate within two weeks of signing the mortgage documents, then later show proof of application to and of receipt of the eligible FortisBC rebate before receiving the $2,000 Vancity rebate.  The offer supplements an existing mortgage program in which members and non-members who bring their mortgage to Vancity can save up to $1,500 in legal and appraisal fees, which is available until June 30.

       " 'Library system considers property tax levy The Kanawha County Library is preparing to present voters with a library-specific property tax that would provide the library system with about $3 million each year.  That\\'s nearly 40 percent of the system\\'s annual operating budget, and near the amount it regularly received from the Kanawha County school system until February. That\\'s when the state Supreme Court ruled that the 1957 law forcing the school system to help fund the library was unconstitutional, ending a decade-long legal battle and leaving library officials scrambling to come up with another funding source.  Since that decision, the library and school system have been in constant talks, trying to sort out the funding relationship between the two public institutions.  In April, the school board agreed to help support the library for another year, contributing nearly $2 million for the next fiscal year.  But school board members have indicated the funding will end there, and both parties want the library to have an independent funding source. School board president Pete Thaw has been especially vocal in his opposition to any scenario that involves the library receiving additional funding from the school system.  Last month, the school board agreed to let the library take a levy to voters under the school system\\'s umbrella - the library can\\'t do it on its own, but the school system can sponsor a levy to benefit the library.  At their regular meeting Monday, the library\\'s Board of Directors agreed to the idea of that levy - they\\'ll officially vote on whether to approve the plan at their June meeting, when the details are clearer.  \"Discussions have been good,\" President Michael Albert told his fellow library board members. \"I think we have the basis or the framework for a settlement discussion.\"  The levy will probably take place in a special election on a Saturday in November, leaving plenty of time for the library to mount a campaign to get its tax approved.  One of the potential issues with the levy proposal is the question of whether the school board will also ask voters to approve an additional tax for the school system.  The school board has budget issues of its own - a projected $4.5 million deficit in 2014 - and has discussed the possibility of running an additional levy of its own. The deficit comes after the board voted to cap its excess levy last year, in the name of tax relief for the public.  Many school board members have said they now regret that decision and would like to seek additional tax support from the public. But the issue has been contentious, with Thaw saying he will refuse support any move to increase taxes.  The board has yet to take any official action on the issue, but Superintendent Ron Duerring has been asked to develop a plan to present to the board.

       " 'EBN News ETFs can now be placed into retirement plans Mid Atlantic Trust Company says it has resolved recordkeeping problems that have kept exchange-traded funds from being part of holdings in 401(k) and other retirement plans.  The state-chartered trust company says it has resolved a problem with fractional shares that result from trading in ETFs that have kept such funds from being kept in retirement plans. The firm says it will buy and sell whole shares in the market and hold fractional shares as necessary. This will allow \"dollar certain\" transactions that until this have prevented the information systems that keep track of funds from recognizing and tracking ETF shares.  Shares will be bought at end-of-day prices, allowing same-day settlement for recordkeeping purposes. Mutual funds historically have determined the value of their assets at the end of each trading day, for their investors. ETFs, however, follow the three-day settlement cycle of equities markets.  In postings to its website, Mid Atlantic says this will \"allow record keepers the ability to handle ETFs using the same systems and processes they already have in place for trading mutual funds.\\'\\'  Roughly $13 trillion are held in the United States in mutual funds, which surged in popularity in the \\'80s and \\'90s. At the end of 2012, $1.3 trillion was held in the U.S. in ETFs, which got started 20 years ago by State Street Corporation. The ability to trade shares in the funds as if they were shares of stock has made them an increasingly significant part of equities trading on national exchanges. In 2012, exchange-traded products accounted for 14.3% of all trading on stock markets in the United States.  A technology unit of the company, Mid Atlantic Financial Platforms, has introduced what it calls the ETFxChange, to resolve the recordkeeping issues and spur their use in retirement plans.  Shares of ETFs from BlackRock\\'s family of iShares products, as well as ETFs from PowerShares, Wisdom Tree, State Street and Vanguard also can be handled by the system. Stadion Money Management in Watkinsville, Ga., confirms that it will use the platform on behalf of its customers.\\xa0  Roughly 90% of the assets under management at Stadion are placed into exchange-traded funds, according to vice president and portfolio manager Will McGough. But, until now, participants in the plan only see that a portion of their assets are held in the Stadion 2010 Target Date Fund, for instance. Now, investors will see the individual ETFs being bought and sold, as McGough or another manager allocates the purchases or sales across all participants.  Two-thirds of the assets placed in funds managed by Stadion are held in qualified retirement plans, McGough says.  Mid Atlantic also launched a related ModelxChange that allows money managers, investment advisors and plan recordkeepers to create and maintain investsing models for 401(k) plans that mix ETFs with mutual funds.

       " 'Local Silverman: Leaving a job? Do 401(k) research The first, and sometimes only, introduction you may have to investing is through your 401(k) plan at work. This could leave you vulnerable from the get-go, although you may not realize it. After all, the 401(k) plan provider is vetted and hired by your company to administer the retirement plan, so most would assume the provider will give you great advice. But a recent Government Accountability Office (GAO) report may lead you to reconsider those assumptions when it comes to how providers handle questions from employees leaving their current companies. The result sometimes sounds a bit more like a sales tactic than pure advice.  When an employee has left a company and wants to get money out of the plan, the only option is to have a conversation with the provider. These providers are usually large insurance or mutual fund companies who make a lot of their money by convincing people to put their investments with them to manage. So if an employee getting ready to leave a company calls up and asks about the 401(k), the person on the other end of the phone has a bit of a bias. Of course they want that 401(k) money rolled over into an IRA managed by their firm.  In fact, many times when our office helps a client with this, we go to the provider\\'s website to download a form to start the rollover process and find the only instructions and forms available are to roll the plan into that firm\\'s accounts. Want to move it somewhere else? No problem, just call and talk to one of their sales people er advisors.\"  But a rollover sometimes isn\\'t the best option and it is never the only option. So what happens if the employee doesn\\'t know what to do and calls to ask the provider what they should do about the money in their former employer\\'s 401(k)? Well, according to the GAO report, it seems that about one-third of the firms recommend the IRA rollover without taking time to find out anything about the employee\\'s situation or discussing the other options they have. (There were many other troubling things that came out of this investigation, but you get the drift.)  If you are leaving a job and have a 401(k) there, a discussion of options should indeed include a rollover to an IRA. And more often than not this is the best recommendation. But you should also discuss and consider keeping the money where it is, rolling it into your new employer\\'s plan, or even cashing it out.  While the majority of plan providers seem to do a decent job helping the plan participant navigate an exit strategy, with one-third allowing their greed to get in the way, it is a good idea to do your homework before you make that call or visit a representative.',\n",
       " 'New models beckon as reforms drive broker revenues down New rules on OTC derivatives will accelerate the shift of investment banks\\' fixed income, currencies and commodities business to electronic trading over the next three years, a new report has found.  New rules on OTC derivatives will accelerate the shift of investment banks\\' fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) business to electronic trading over the next three years, a new report has found.  Deutsche Bank yesterday released a report on the impacts of new swaps regulation on future investment banking income in Europe, which suggested pressure on margins would herald further consolidation.  It found that changes introduced under the European market infrastructure regulation (EMIR) and proposed revisions to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive in Europe (MiFID) reinforced the migration of FICC business to commoditised electronic trading already underpinned by capital and liquidity requirements of Basel III.  Both the Dodd-Frank and EMIR have introduced reporting and central clearing rules for derivatives. Under MiFID II standardised OTC derivatives will be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, such as organised trading facilities or multilateral trading facilities.  The report said the push to move derivatives on to exchanges or alternative venues will see banks lose the ability to warehouse. The loss of revenue in G-10 rates trading would be felt most sorely because it is \"the most lucrative part of the investment banking FICC complex\".  \"We expect the general trend of FICC trading moving to electronic venues to accelerate over the next two to three years. MiFID2 in 2015 may end up being the capstone to these changes, rather than the starting point,\" the report said.  \\xa0\"This will leave investment banks charging for market access, and less able to extract rent,\" the report said.  As a result, investment banks could face a loss of US$17 billion in sales and trading revenues by 2016.  European banks were more at risk than US banks because of dependence on swaps revenues and the Financial Transaction Tax being considered by 11 euro-zone states, the report said.  Even though electronic trading tended to be more transparent and cheaper, the overall costs of trading may rise as a result of collateral requirements, said Deutsche Bank. As well as reducing margins and increasing costs in the long term, the migration of OTC derivatives would be particularly painful in the short term.  \"We expect dual running of systems to put upward pressure on costs, making downward pressure on compensation more important than ever. We think the long-run results of these changes will be a wave of industry exists from FICC sales and trading by second tier players.\"  The report described banks with less than a 6% market share as \"at risk\" of exit from full-service FICC sales and trading.  The closure of smaller institutions could lead to further concentration, with the top five FICC houses controlling 55% of the market in the next three years, up from 46% in 2012 and 36% in 2007, the report said.',\n",
       " \"70pc of retirees could be entitled to more income in retirement; Don't accept your provider's annuity offer before reading this... It's a tricky time to be coming up to retirement. Market conditions have led to low annuity rates. According to annuity provider MGM Advantage, over a typical 18-year retirement, a pension pot of £50,000 would today generate £10,224 less income compared with an annuity from just two years ago.  So if there was something you could do to increase your retirement income significantly, wouldn't you want to find out more?  Who is entitled to higher income?  Recent research by MGM Advantage has found that 70pc of retirees could qualify for a better income due to health or lifestyle conditions.  According to MGM Advantage's figures, you could secure as much as 30pc more income on reaching retirement, although this depends on your individual circumstances.  This extra income could help with today's increased cost of living, such as food and fuel bills, which many pensioners are now finding a struggle.  What conditions could have an impact?  According to Partnership, the top five medical conditions that have an effect on enhanced annuity rates are:  - Diabetes  - Cancer  - Stroke  - High blood-pressure  - Chronic obstructive  pulmonary disease  When it comes to lifestyle conditions, being a smoker - or even where you live - can have a big effect on the amount of income you will receive.  Make sure you declare all past and present conditions when you are looking to convert your pension into an annuity.  What should I do about it?  Although it is tempting to accept the first offer from your pension provider, by utilising your Open Market Option you can find out if your pension fund could secure you a higher level of income from another provider. Your existing provider's offer is unlikely to take into account your personal circumstances, such as whether you might qualify for an enhanced annuity. So it's strongly recommended that you obtain financial advice and shop around to see if you come away with a significantly higher income.  The Telegraph has teamed up with Skipton Financial Services Limited (SFS), who can help you explore your options and make the most of your pension fund.  Where appropriate, SFS will put you in touch with UK-based annuity specialists Gateway Specialist Advice Services, who can search for an alternative retirement annuity/income option on your behalf.

       " \"LETTERS Old buildings need checking ABOUT three years ago, during restoration of my daughter's corrugated iron roof on her apartment, a former 1885 warehouse off Lonsdale St, we noticed the sandstone urns and lintels had large bits missing on the sections overhanging the lane, 15m below.  Clearly these bits had fallen over the years, and the rest could go at any time.  My conscience said someone needed to act, and I had to be that someone, so off I went to Town Hall to report the danger.  A young man rang me back to say ``Oh we can't get up there, it's too high, so we can't do anything about it''.  In light of the three deaths in the brick wall collapse in Swanston St, would it not be wise for councillors to instruct the bureaucrats to get off their backsides and make an effort to assess all the old buildings for potential falling matter before someone else gets killed?  Roger Dunkley, Chirnside Park  Foggy ideas  THE current debate on superannuation seems to be getting more and more predicated on ``smoke and mirrors'' arguments, ignoring basic facts. Governments approach superannuation as though it is a cost to them, when in fact the individual taxpayer and employer actually put the money into the compulsory superannuation system.  Public servants and politicians' superannuation is a direct cost to the taxpayer and their retirement incomes are guaranteed regardless, whereas the individual taxpayer is reliant on performance competency of the superannuation industry for their retirement income.  Tax concessions seem to come about when politicians assess their financial futures after three or four terms in parliament and develop policies that maximise their future retirement benefits.  When he retires, the Treasurer can look forward to $168,000 a year for the rest of his life.  The problem with governments trying to reduce expenditure on old-age pensions is that people with insufficient retirement income are disadvantaged by the government means test on individual assets, which reduce the amount of age pension entitlement once the individual's assets reach $230,000.  This, and the suggestion that 11 million taxpayers put an extra $25,000-$35,000 into superannuation voluntarily each year, indicates to me that politicians have lost the plot when trying to formulate fair and equitable tax and superannuation policies.  D. MacDonald, Bayswater  Travel a perk  TO answer Mark La Brooy's question (50/50, Apr 11) about why Financial Services and Superannuation Minister Bill Shorten is in China: he is another politician on a taxpayer-funded sightseeing tour, with the blessing of Julia Gillard, or whoever is running the country.

       " 'Homes Answering those taxingRRSP questions After speaking with customers and friends, there is still confusion about the government\\'s RRSP First Home Buyers Program.  Questions such as \"What\\'s the maximum I can withdraw?\" \"When do I have to pay it back?\" \"What are the tax implications?\" and others linger in the back of first-time homebuyers\\' minds.  What is the First Home Buyers Program? It is a program that allows first-time home buyers to withdraw a maximum of $25,000 from their RRSP in order to fund their downpayment.  But, these RRSP contributions must be in the account for at least 90 days before they can be used and must be repaid within 15 years of the withdrawal.  For those who find this option interesting, but lack the current funds, there are ways to get there. First, find out how much RRSP contribution room you have.  This can be checked from the bottom of your notice of income tax assessment which everyone receives annually.  Or, if you cannot locate yours, you can log into the Canada Revenue Agency\\'s website to find out.  Once you determine how much room you have remaining in your RRSP, you can come up with a plan to top it up.  One idea is to take out a loan such as BMO RRSP ReadiLine and use the funds to contribute to your RRSP.  The loan can then be repaid and you can receive a tax credit for the RRSP contribution, which can be used to build your downpayment or help repay the loan.  After you\\'ve withdrawn an amount under the First Home Buyers Program from your RRSP, you must repay it within 15 years but you have a two-year grace period before you have to start paying it back.  So if you withdrew the full $25,000, then you would need to repay approximately $1,670 per year.  Let\\'s say after the two-year grace period, you only repay $1,000 during the third year. The remaining $670 would become taxable income, which could mean you might owe the government some income tax.  So it\\'s good idea to ensure that you\\'ll have the ability to repay the amount you withdrew drew from your RRSP within 15 years. Speak to your tax advisor to get more information about the tax implications of contributing to your RRSP and withdrawing RRSP money under the First Home Buyers Program.  Did you know that if you have not owned a home in the past five years, you may still qualify for the First Home Buyers Program?

       " 'DJ Tax Havens Shift as Luxembourg, Switzerland Loosen Bank Secrecy It is still possible to hide a fortune in Europe, even as Switzerland, Luxembourg and some other countries known for bank privacy give up their secrets under pressure.  Britain and its Channel Islands, for example, are favorite destinations for some who want to keep money below the radar of tax authorities and out of sight of the world in general.  \"The city of London is its own secret jurisdiction,\" said Nicole Tichon, executive director of the Tax Justice Network USA, a not-for-profit organization in Washington, D.C., that tracks tax evasion around the globe.  Guernsey and Jersey, two of the British crown dependencies that make up the Channel Islands, are home to secret money.  Overall, Europe is becoming a less favored destination for secret wealth, losing ground to havens elsewhere, such as Singapore and Hong Kong. Switzerland has been loosening its once-tight secrecy laws. On Wednesday, Luxembourg announced plans to begin sharing information on its bank-account holders with other European countries.  Tax havens everywhere are under pressure from the U.S. and some other countries, such as Germany, which seek greater banking transparency. The U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, passed in 2010, aims to prevent tax evasion by U.S. citizens and includes penalties for foreign financial institutions that don\\'t disclose American account holders.  Some tax experts argue that as the effects of FATCA spread, there will be few safe hiding places left. Tax whistleblowers, better coordination between countries, and aggressive enforcement are making a dent.  Asia is next for enforcement efforts. Latin America may be lagging behind Europe but the tax police will catch up there, according to Scott D. Michel , a tax-compliance expert and a partner in the Washington, D.C., office law firm Caplin & Drysdale .  \"There may be some rogue countries in Latin America that will ignore it, but would you want to give your money to a bank in a country run by Hugo Chavez\\'s successor?\" said Mr. Michel.  There are believed to be trillions of dollars now in offshore hiding places. A report on tax havens last week by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists looked at a number of jurisdictions, including Singapore and the Cook Islands, and detailed the offshore holdings of people and companies in more than 170 countries and territories.  For some who track global tax evasion, the U.S. tops the list of places to hide money. Delaware is a leader in trusts that are constructed to minimize or, often enough, eliminate any taxes on the wealth they contain.

       " 'Retirement Canadians should be allowed to contribute more to CPP to \\'reignite a culture of savings,\\' urges CIBC chief We need to provide Canadians with further choice - choice that gives them date certainty and real dollar amount certainty  Canadians should be allowed to contribute more to the Canadian Pension Plan to \"reignite a culture of savings,\" CIBC president and CEO Gerry McCaughey said Wednesday in a speech.  \"I believe the time has come to give Canadians the opportunity to enhance their pension savings by making additional, voluntary contributions to the Canada Pension Plan - or a CPP-like vehicle,\" Mr. McCaughey told an audience of senior government and business leaders at the National Summit on Pension Reform in Fredericton, NB.  Related  Canadians had better learn to love their jobs, as retirement dream fades  How to reshape your retirement plans in an era of volatile markets  Retirement savings challenge young people  Today, for many Canadians, there\\'s a bigger emphasis placed on investing - on rates of return - than on the critical need to actually set aside money  According to new research conducted by CIBC, almost 6 million Canadians will face a drop in living standards of more than 20% if current savings rate trends continue. \"When we look at those 5.8 million people - we see that most of them are young. In fact, our economists estimate that almost 60% of adults in their late 20s or early 30s, can expect to experience a significant decline in their standard of living when they retire,\" he said.  \"A generation ago, a person starting out in the world focused first on earning money. Then, as they found their way in the workplace and their earnings grew, they began to think about saving,\" he said. \"Today, for many Canadians, there\\'s a bigger emphasis placed on investing - on rates of return - than on the critical need to actually set aside money.\"  A 35-year-old person today puts aside, on average, less than half of what a 35-year-old saved a generation ago, he added. With company pensions becoming increasingly rare, Canadians must refocus on savings.  Under CPP currently, employers and employees each pay annual premiums of 4.95% on the amount of their pensionable earnings between $3,500 and $51,100, the upper threshold having been increased by $1,000 this year, for a maximum premium of $2,356.20 each. Self-employed people pay the combined premiums, $4,712.40. Maximum benefits for 2013 are $12,150 annually from CPP, adjusted each year for inflation, and $546.07 monthly from Old Age Security, adjusted quarterly.  \"I believe that a reasonable starting point, benefitting the greatest number of individuals, would be to allow Canadians to increase their contributions to the CPP,\" he said. \"We need to provide Canadians with further choice - choice that gives them date certainty and real dollar amount certainty. A choice that will help Canadians as individuals, and Canada as a nation, reignite a culture of savings.\"  With files from Postmedia News',\n",
       " 'Money HOT STOCK What\\'s new News Corporation\\'s second-quarter results comfortably exceeded market expectations, with normalised net income up 5 per cent and earnings per share (EPS) jumping 13 per cent.  The powerhouse cable network division posted another stellar performance, rising 7 per cent off an already impressive base to $US945 million ($914 million). It now accounts for more than 60 per cent of the group\\'s earnings.  The much-maligned free-to-air television division also registered strong growth, up 19 per cent in the quarter to $US224 million.  On the negative side, the Italian satellite pay TV broadcaster, Sky Italia, turned in a loss of $US20 million (versus a $US6 million profit a year ago), as it lost 28,000 subscribers and ramped up programming investments to stem the tide.  Filmed entertainment saw earnings decline 3 per cent to $US383 million.  Outlook The solid quarterly result was partly overshadowed by a cut to News Corporation\\'s operating earnings growth guidance for the full year, from \"high single to low double digit\" to a \"mid-to-high single digit\" percentage gain.  While disappointing, the magnitude of the downgrade was not material.  Furthermore, one of the main causes of the downgrade was the structural problems afflicting its Australian newspaper assets - no longer a surprise to anyone.  What we are focused on, and remain attracted to, is News Corporation\\'s diverse portfolio of leading electronic media content assets, most of which demonstrate either very strong growth outlook (the cable-network division) or remarkable resilience (film, free-to-air TV).  Importantly, there are plenty of catalysts for the market to reappraise the underlying value of these assets, as the proposed split of the print businesses into a separately listed vehicle remains on track for mid-2013.  Price While the stock price slumped 4 per cent on the results day, due to market disappointment over the cut in earnings guidance, it has more than recovered since then. Over the past six months, the stock has surged 23 per cent; for 12 months it is up 53 per cent - easily outperforming the overall market.  Worth buying? The downgrade in News Corporation\\'s earnings guidance for the full year was disappointing. However, its magnitude was immaterial and its importance pales in comparison with the continuing strong growth of the cable network division and the remarkable resilience of the film and free-to-air TV assets.  The company\\'s balance sheet remains robust (gearing of only 30 per cent and an interest cover of six times), notwithstanding $US6 billion in stock repurchases over the past eight months, with another $US4 billion left in the buy-back program.  While the stock is trading at more than 16 times fiscal 2013 consensus EPS estimates, this quickly drops to less than 14 times the following year, due to the strong earnings growth outlook. Consequently, we believe the stock is worth buying at current levels.',\n",
       " 'FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY Death, taxes and investment returns; Markets insight Benjamin Franklin always accepted that the US constitution might change; \"The only things we can be certain of are death and taxes,\" he wrote to French scientist Jean-Baptiste Leroy. If Leroy had known about the planned new top tax rate of 75 per cent in France he\\'d surely have agreed.  Death is not really relevant to investors; you can\\'t take it with you, after all. But taxes are vital - and along with other investment costs, they are often ignored by those looking back at past returns.  This makes some charts from Stanhope Capital, which runs money for wealthy families and charities, particularly handy. Jonathan Bell at Stanhope looked back at past tax rates in the UK and calculated the returns needed merely to beat inflation, for a top-rate taxpayer.  First, the tax rates. For those in the UK complaining about the current 45 per cent top rate, which kicks in at £150,000, just be grateful you didn\\'t live in the 1960s: the top rate of tax on investment income was about 90 per cent until Margaret Thatcher slashed it in 1979.  In 1967 it hit an eye-watering 136 per cent, because of a one-off extra charge of 45 per cent, on top of income tax and the investment income surcharge.  The FTSE All-Share index had a great year in 1967, rising 29 per cent. But the dividend yield of 5.8 per cent at the start of that year can\\'t have been much use to anyone, given the prevailing income tax level. Luckily, capital gains tax was lower, having only been introduced in 1965 at 30 per cent, so investors could still make money from rising share prices. But today investors have been rushing to buy dividend-paying shares, as their search for income forces them to take more risk and buy \"bond proxies\", companies with strong balance sheets which look likely to keep paying (and raising) their dividends without a problem.  The chart (left) shows the pre-tax return needed from income just to keep up with inflation.  The gap at the end of the 1950s is because prices were falling. Note that the chart only goes up to the end of 2011; with the latest reading of retail prices up 3.1 per cent year-on-year, top-rate taxpayers would need income of 5.6 per cent to maintain the value of their investments, or capital gains of 4.3 per cent.  Given last year\\'s stellar returns from equities, shareholders did rather well, for a change.  Terry Smith is of course quite right to say that the tax tail should never wag the investment dog. But this chart helps explain why it often does, and why tax planning tends to take priority over sensible investment structures for so many financial advisers.

       " 'Portman Asks Treasury Secretary Nominee Jacob Lew Tough Questions Regarding Mahoning Valley Delphi Salaried Retirees Stripped of Pensions - Decreased retiree income and benefits will cost the Youngstown area about $58 million per year in lost economic activity Office of Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) News Release  Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), submitted questions for the Congressional Record for the Senate Finance Committee hearing considering the nomination of Jacob Lew to serve as Treasury Secretary regarding the treatment of retired Delphi salaried workers during the General Motors bankruptcy. The Administration has yet to sufficiently address and remedy the treatment of workers who lost a significant portion of their pension benefits, while other retirees from the same company received far better treatment.  \"During a time of high unemployment and weak economic growth, hundreds of Mahoning Valley families are still scratching their heads in disbelief and disappointment, wondering why they did not receive the benefits promised to help them care for their families after years of hard work,\" said Portman. \"I am concerned by the lack of transparency throughout this process, and will continue to push the Administration to answer tough questions regarding the unfair treatment of Delphi retirees.\"  When Delphi\\'s defined benefit pension plan was terminated, Delphi workers lost an estimated 30 to 70 percent in benefits. The Auto Policy Task Force subsequently decided to \"top-up\" the pension benefits of certain retirees, not the 20,000 salaried retirees, including 1,500 salaried retirees in the Mahoning Valley. This has had a severe economic impact on thousands of retired Delphi salaried employees in Ohio. An economic impact study by Youngstown State University found that decreased retiree income and benefits will cost the Youngstown area about $58 million per year in lost economic activity.  Portman submitted the three questions below for the Congressional Record:  (1) As General Motors Company\\'s primary lender in bankruptcy, the Treasury Department played a substantial role in GM\\'s 2009 bankruptcy and subsequent resolution of Delphi pensions. This involvement culminated in GM\\'s decision to fund portions of hourly but not salaried Delphi pensions. Did the Treasury Department receive any communication, direction, or other influence from the White House on Delphi pensions?  (2) Did any official at the Treasury Department communicate with GM in any way to influence the company toward supporting Delphi hourly pensions, or against supporting salaried pensions?  (3) On August 13, 2012, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp requested that the Treasury Department provide \"All records... that relate to: Delphi; and/or GM\\'s interest in Delphi.\" To date, the Treasury Department has only provided a selection of documents and has refused to certify that it has or will comply completely with the request. Does the Treasury Department plan to comply with the Ways and Means Committee\\'s request?

       " 'Supreme Court Of Canada Releases Decision in Indalex This morning, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) released its decision in Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v. United Steelworkers (Indalex). A majority of the\\xa0SCC made the following rulings, which have wide-ranging ramifications for lenders, employers and pension plan administrators of Ontario-registered defined benefit pension plans:  The SCC upheld the finding of the Ontario Court of Appeal (ONCA) that the deemed trust imposed under subsection 57(4) of the Ontario Pension Benefits Act (PBA) applies only to a pension plan that is terminated, but, when it applies, extends to the entirety of a defined benefit plan\\'s \"wind up deficiency.\" This finding may have significant ramifications for lenders relying on security interests in accounts and/or inventory, since, under the Ontario Personal Property Security Act, these interests are expressly made subordinate to \"deemed trusts\" under the PBA.  The SCC overturned the ONCA in finding that the deemed trust did not have priority over the claim of the debtor in possession (DIP) lender in this case. The Companies\\' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) judge had made an order granting the DIP loan \"super-priority\" over any statutory trusts, including those arising under the PBA. The SCC overturned the ONCA and held that the doctrine of federal paramountcy means that the court-ordered DIP priority supersedes claims under the PBA\\'s deemed trust provision, without need to have paramountcy asserted in the relevant court order.  The SCC\\'s decision is consistent with the ONCA\\'s finding that the directors of Indalex Limited failed to properly manage a conflict of interest between their fiduciary duties to the corporation on the one hand and, in their role as plan administrator, to the pension plan beneficiaries on the other, when they proceeded to seek a court order granting priority to the DIP loan without sufficient notice to the beneficiaries.  Although the SCC found that the directors of Indalex had acted in a conflict of interest vis-à-vis plan beneficiaries, a majority of the judges overturned the ONCA\\'s award of a constructive trust over the assets of the estate in favour of beneficiaries of Indalex\\'s executive pension plan (to which the PBA\\'s deemed trust provision did not apply).

       " 'BEHIND THE NUMBERS Report on Business: Globe Investor Column What\\'s building over the border? Optimism jokane@globeandmail.com  The stop-and-start recovery has left many investors wary of good news. However, the rebound in the U.S. housing market looks to be not only real, but a potential turning point in the country\\'s slow climb back to normality.  James Marple of TD Economics says in a report published this week that the real estate rebound that gained speed in 2012 \"was likely just the beginning of a multi-year rise in the U.S. housing market.\"  If this proves true, it\\'s welcome news for Canadians, since our exporters stand to gain a great deal from our biggest trading partner\\'s growing appetite for homes.  Why should we be optimistic? U.S. housing starts in December were up 37 per cent over the same period a year earlier, according to the Census Bureau, while analytics service CoreLogic estimated home prices rose 8.3 per cent in the same period.  The annualized pace of 954,000 housing starts in December, 2012, is nearly double the level in April, 2009, when starts were plugging along at a 478,000-units-a-year clip. At first glance, the surge may seem like a unrealistically large uptick - but if you compare it to historical levels, which once passed 2 million units a year, it\\'s clear there\\'s still plenty of room to rise.  Relative to the history of housing starts, the U.S. has \"barely surpassed the trough of previous cycles,\" Mr. Marple wrote.  Further gains will be fuelled by a brightening economic picture. The recession knocked the wind out of the labour market, making it more difficult for people - especially young people - to form new households. As employment numbers have rebounded, the number of households headed by people between 24 and 34 has also grown, Mr. Marple wrote.  That sets up the country for growth of 1.3 million new households each year. The new households should generate plenty of demand for new homes, especially given how cheap home prices have become. The 32-per-cent price drop after the housing bubble\\'s late-2005 peak brought home prices from historic highs of nearly four times the U.S. median annual income to 2.6 times that value in 2012.  This is \"exactly in line with its long-run average,\" Mr. Marple wrote, and makes homes as affordable as they were between 1979 and 1999. Which makes a pretty good case for optimism.  As always, there will be headwinds, including historically high foreclosure rates and rising student debt among new graduates, the economist wrote.  But considering the pace of household formation in the U.S., Mr. Marple wrote, new-housing activity is still as much as 30 per cent behind where it could be. That could be up to 40 per cent if you take into account the need to replace decaying housing stock. Anyone need some Canadian lumber?',\n",

       " 'News Family of IRA man illegally shot by Paras slams failure to quiz police witnesses THE family of an IRA man shot by soldiers 40 years ago says the failure of police to identify two Special Branch officers who witnessed the killing is \"shameful\".  Aine McCann questioned how the officers had never been identified after a new report found that soldiers who shot her father were unjustified in opening fire.  Joe McCann, a member of the Official IRA, was hit several times when challenged near his home in the Markets area of south Belfast in 1972.  The Historical Enquiries Team (HET) accused police of failing to properly investigate the \"unlawful\" killing of the married fatherof-four.  The review team\\'\\'s report said: \"The HET considers that Joe\\'\\'s actions did not amount to the level of specific threat which could have justified the soldiers opening fire in accordance with the Army Rules of Engagement or their standard operating procedures.\"  Mr McCann, one of the Official IRA\\'s leading activists, was shot on April 15, 1972, in Joy Street.  Two RUC Special Branch officers recognised a disguised Mc-Cann and decided to arrest him, asking nearby soldiers for help, but McCann ran off.  Evidence from police and soldiers was that they shouted at him to stop or they would open fire. After he failed to halt, three paratroopers opened fire and he was hit by two or three bullets.  Two of the soldiers were interviewed under caution in London. The third did not cooperate.  The HET said McCann was unarmed and there was no evidence he was doing anything other than trying to escape.  The report also said the review team was unable to question the officers present that day.  Aine said that the failure of the PSNI to reveal the identity of the police officers involved on the day was \"shameful\".  \"It has not been possible to question the Special Branch version of events because, incredibly, the RUC then and the PSNI now, claim not to be aware of the identities of the two Special Branch officers that were following Joe that day,\" she said.  The HET discovered a document in the archives of the First Battalion of the Parachute Regiment - the first time its existence has emerged - which prohibited shooting when someone ran away when challenged or did not halt, but was not endangering anybody\\'s life or a place under guard. Anne McCann said he could have been arrested alive.  \"The British Army shot him, that is the end of the story. Had anybody else wanted to do that he would have had a better chance.\"  profile Joe McCann (right) was described in death notices as a staff officer in the Official IRA and his seizure of a bakery in Belfast during internment went down in republican folklore.  Originally from the lower Falls, he moved to the Markets after marrying Anne. Thousands of mourners attended his funeral to Milltown Cemetery, which was led by an Official IRA guard of honour.',\n",

By Nicholas Winning  Tackling extremist violence is one of the priorities of the Group of Eight leading nations following the attack on a gas facility in Algeria in which scores of people were killed, including several Britons, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday.  As western allies put pressure on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, networks affiliated with the terrorist group have grown in Yemen, Somalia and parts of North Africa--places that have suffered through \"hostage-taking, terrorism and crime,\" he said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  \"I\\'ll put my cards on the table. I believe we are in the midst of a long struggle against murderous terrorists and the poisonous ideology that supports them,\" he said. \"To defeat this menace, we\\'ve got to be tough, intelligent and patient--and this is the argument I\\'ll be making at the G-8.\"  There will be a place for military action where necessary, he said, adding that the French were right to act in Mali and he supported their intervention.  Efforts to tackle the narrative of extremist groups should involve diplomacy, aid budgets, political relations and military and security cooperation, he said.  \"The G-8 can discuss how we can best divide up some of the work between us--and how we can partner up with the countries worst affected to overcome this threat and like I say, this will be right up there on our agenda,\" he said.  Mr. Cameron also reiterated that under the U.K.\\'s yearlong presidency of the G-8 in 2013, the group would also focus on advancing free trade, ensuring tax compliance and promoting greater transparency.  The prime minister also reiterated his case for his plan--should he win the next general election scheduled in 2015--to renegotiate the U.K.\\'s relationship with the European Union and then hold a national referendum on whether to remain members of the bloc by the end of 2017.  Asked about whether this plan would put businesses off investing in Britain, he said there was already a debate under way about Britain\\'s place in Europe and it was better to try and lead the debate on the issue.  \"It is much better to be frank and open about that and set out the pathway where we are going to resolve this issue in a way that will actually benefit business because we will end up with a more competitive, more open European Union ,\" he said. \"Yes, all courses of action on this issue have their difficulties, but I would argue the riskiest thing of all would be to do nothing.\"       -For continuously updated news from The Wall Street Journal, see WSJ.com at  http://wsj.com .

       " 'Are Old iPhones a Gateway Drug? Rather than plunk down $200 for an iPhone 5, many smartphone buyers are going with the older iPhone 4, which is available for free with a two-year contract. This trend toward the cheaper devices may concern investors, but in the long run, there\\'s some evidence it could actually be good for Apple (AAPL).  Discussing Apple\\'s earnings Wednesday, CEO Tim Cook said that iPhone 4 sales \"remained strong.\" The iPhone 4 costs $450 without a two-year contract, compared to $650 for the iPhone 5, which is both faster and has a larger screen. On Tuesday, Verizon Wireless said the newer model accounted for less than half of the 6.2 million iPhones the company activated last quarter. \"The shift toward older phones may weigh on average selling prices,\" says Brian Colello, analyst at Morningstar.  But here\\'s the possible silver lining: There\\'s a good chance most of those people buying older iPhones will eventually upgrade to a new one, analysts say. Most buyers already own an iPhone. In fact, the company has one of the highest upgrade rates in the industry. Some 83% of iPhone owners in December 2012 said they would upgrade to another iPhone--up from 73% a year ago, according to a survey last month by Morgan Stanley Research. That retention rate was 63% for Samsung and just 47% for HTC.  The older phones are in effect gateway gadgets: Most customers who buy the older iPhones have never owned an Apple product before, experts say, and after getting a taste, many are likely to want more. It\\'s a way of reeling in new customers and putting them on the two-year upgrade cycle, analysts say. Nearly 20% of iPhone sales in the final quarter of last year were people switching from Android, up from 9% for the same period in 2011, according to a new report by consumer research group Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.  To be sure, Apple is heavily dependent on the iconic gadget, and investors remain concerned about softening sales growth. The iPhone accounts for around 56% of its revenue--one reason the company\\'s share price has fallen from its high of over $700 last September. The iPhone sold 47.8 million units in the first fiscal quarter, the highest quarterly iPhone sales figure and up 29% from the year-earlier period. However, the company forecasts total revenue rising just 7% in the current quarter.  But the strong resale market for iPhones suggests that Apple will continue to benefit from the two-year upgrade cycle. Ahead of a new iPhone release, the older devices still sell for as much as $300 on resale sites, meaning consumers who own an iPhone can effectively upgrade to the new model for free--and may even earn a profit, says Yung Trang, president of TechBargains.com.

       " 'News £75,000 care cap is \\'mean and cynical\\' CAMPAIGNERS HAVE attacked plans by the Government to introduce a £75,000 cap on long-term care costs as \"too high, mean and cynical\".  The National Pensioners Convention (NPC) said that only a \"tiny\" number of people would benefit from a cap set at such a level.  In the next few days ministers are poised to unveil a first limit on how much an individual will have to pay for care fees before the state steps in.  However, the proposed £75,000 limit is significantly higher than many experts had expected.  A government report by the economist Andrew Dilnot suggested a limit as low as £25,000, but the study also said a cap of £60,000 could be viable. The limit would not apply to accommodation costs.  \"Such a cap would be too high and would be a mean and cynical move. Only a very small number of people have care costs that reach that level,\" said Neil Duncan-Jordan, the NPC\\'s national officer.  \"Any claim by the Government that they had sorted out long-term care would ring hollow. The two big problems with the system are the quality of care and the fact that many people are losing their homes to fund care. This cap won\\'t address these issues.\"  At the moment anyone with assets worth more than £23,250 - including their home - has to pay for their own care. The average cost of such care is £700 a week. Currently about 40,000 people a year are obliged to sell their homes to cover the cost of care.  Ros Altmann, the directorgeneral of Saga, has called on the Government to raise the £23,250 asset threshold. She also believes that a £75,000 care cost cap is too small to protect many people from having to sell their homes.  Ministers ruled out a cap as low as £35,000 as it would cost taxpayers as much as £2billion a year. A limit of £75,000 would cost £700million.  Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said the Government had \"fallen far short\" of a fair solution to the care crisis. \"A cap on care bills of £75,000 per person, or £150,000 per couple, will not protect the home and life savings of an average family,\" he said. \"Andrew Dilnot\\'s proposed cap of £35,000 would be a significant step towards helping older people protect what they\\'ve worked for.  \"Labour remains open to cross-party talks on funding the Dilnot plan and are disappointed the Government has decided to go it alone with this half-baked alternative.\"  Stephen Dorrell, a former Tory health secretary who chairs the Commons health committee, said it was an \"important step\". \"Clearly £75,000 is at the high end, but introducing a limit is a good step along the path of sorting out long-term care,\" he said.  \\'A small number of people have care costs that reach that lever\\'',\n",
       " 'Public Health; Recent Studies from Research Unit for General Practice Add New Data to Public Health 2013 JAN 18 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health & Medicine Week -- Investigators publish new report on Public Health. According to news originating from Bergen, Norway, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Women\\'s higher risk of disability pension compared with men is found in countries with high female work participation and universal welfare schemes. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which self-perceived health, family situation and work factors explain women\\'s higher risk of disability pension.\"  Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Research Unit for General Practice, \"We also explored how these factors influenced the gender difference across educational strata. The population-based Hordaland Health Study (HUSK) was conducted in 1997-99 and included inhabitants born in 1953-57 in Hordaland County, Norway. The current study included 5,959 men and 6,306 women in paid work with valid information on education and self-perceived health. Follow-up data on disability pension, for a period of 5-7 years, was obtained by linking the health survey to a national registry of disability pension. Cox regression analyses were employed. During the follow-up period 99 (1.7%) men and 230 (3.6%) women were awarded disability pension, giving a twofold risk of disability pension for women compared with men. Except for a moderate impact of self-perceived health, adjustment for family situation and work factors did not influence the gender difference in risk. Repeating the analyses in strata of education, the gender difference in risk of disability pension among the highly educated was fully explained by self-perceived health and work factors. In the lower strata of education there remained a substantial unexplained gender difference in risk. In a Norwegian cohort of middle-aged men and women, self-perceived health, family situation and work factors could not explain women\\'s higher likelihood of disability pension. However, analyses stratified by educational level indicate that mechanisms behind the gender gap in disability pension differ by educational levels.\"  According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Recognizing the heterogeneity within gender may contribute to a deeper understanding of women\\'s higher risk of disability pension.\"  For more information on this research see: Women\\'s higher likelihood of disability pension: the role of health, family and work.

       " 'Business Area\\'s home loan defaults down 26% in 2012 Detroit News Finance Editor  The tsunami of foreclosures that has ebbed and flowed through the American economy since the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007 continued today with the news of another crackdown on foreclosure abuses even as the total of homes lost to default declined during 2012.  Metro Detroit had its second consecutive double-digit decline in foreclosure activity last year with a nearly 26 percent drop, according to RealtyTrac, an Irvine, Calif., foreclosure tracking company.  The Detroit region\\'s year-end total of 39,039 foreclosure filings was its lowest since 2006, when the foreclosure crisis began to swell. Most other areas of the country are experiencing foreclosure activity closer to 2007 and 2008 levels, according to RealtyTrac.  Foreclosures peaked in 2010, both nationally and in Michigan, and have declined every year since then. The decline contributed to last year\\'s 6.2 percent growth in Metro Detroit home sales.  Meanwhile, the Consumer Finance Protection Board in Washington, D.C., announced new rules for mortgage servicers that offer new protections to borrowers struggling to keep their homes.  \"For many borrowers, dealing with mortgage servicers has meant unwelcome surprises and constantly getting the runaround,\" Bureau Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. \"In too many cases, it has led to unnecessary foreclosures. Our rules ensure fair treatment for all borrowers.\"  Mortgage servicers aren\\'t the investors who own the loans, but are third-party companies that deal with borrowers, collecting payments, and handling tax and insurance escrow accounts.  Servicers have been the subject of several new enforcement actions. Last week, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced an $8.5 billion settlement over 3.8 million mishandled foreclosures by 10 major servicers.  A related review of 4.4 million foreclosures had started in 2011, but had become bogged down without a single dollar being paid out to homeowners.  On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will pay a combined $557million to settle federal complaints that they wrongfully foreclosed on homeowners who should have been allowed to stay in their homes.  Finally, Friday is the deadline for another group of mortgage borrowers hit by faulty foreclosures to file their claims under the $25 billion national \"robo-signing\" settlement with five major loan servicers - including Detroit\\'s Ally Bank - and 49 states.  Claims can be filed online at www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com.  Borrowers also can contact the settlement administrator, toll-free at (866) 430-8358 or email administrator@nationalmortgagesettlement.com.  The new rules are too little too late for a Metro Detroit attorney who defends homeowners.  \"You\\'ve got thousands of homeowners who have already suffered from just the activities these rules are seeking to address,\" said consumer protection attorney Brian P. Parker of Bingham Farms.  \"What about all the millions of people who have already suffered these problems?\"  boconnor@detnews.com  (313) 222-21145  Associated Press contributed.',\n",
       " 'OnLine U.S. mortgage settlement: Goldman, Morgan Stanley to pay $557M to settle foreclosure-abuse case WASHINGTON - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will pay a combined $557 million to settle U.S. federal complaints that they wrongfully foreclosed on homeowners who should have been allowed to stay in their homes.  The agreements announced Wednesday with the Federal Reserve were similar to deals struck earlier this month with 10 other major banks and mortgage lenders. Combined, the 12 firms will pay more than $9 billion.  The settlements could compensate hundreds of thousands of Americans whose homes were seized because of abuses such as \"robo-signing,\" when banks automatically signed off on foreclosures without properly reviewing documents. The agreement will also help eliminate huge potential liabilities for the banks.  Consumer advocates say regulators settled for too low a price by letting banks avoid full responsibility for foreclosures that victimized families.  Under the settlement, Goldman and Morgan Stanley will pay $232 million in cash compensation to homeowners to end an independent review of loan files required under a 2011 action by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The remaining $325 million will be used to reduce mortgage balances and to forgive outstanding principal on home sales that generated less than borrowers owed on their mortgages.  About 220,000 people whose homes were in foreclosure in 2009 and 2010 are eligible for payments under the deal with the two banks, the Fed said. The payments could range from hundreds of dollars up to $125,000, depending on the type of possible error.  The structure of the deal is nearly identical to the $8.5-billion settlement announced last week with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, MetLife Bank, PNC Financial Services, Sovereign, SunTrust, U.S. Bank and Aurora.  Those banks will pay about $3.3 billion to 3.8 million homeowners to end the review of foreclosures. The rest - $5.2 billion - will go toward mortgage modifications and principal forgiveness.  Two other banks were subject to the 2011 independent reviews. HSBC and Ally Financial have been in discussions with regulators on similar settlements but have yet to reach deals.  Banks and consumer advocates had complained that the loan-by-loan reviews required under the 2011 order were time-consuming and costly and didn\\'t reach many homeowners. Banks were paying large amounts to consultants to review the files. Some questioned the independence of those consultants, who often ruled against homeowners.  The settlements don\\'t close the book on the housing crisis, which brought more than 4 million foreclosures. They cover only borrowers who were in foreclosure in 2009 and 2010. And resolving millions of claims involving multiple banks and mortgage companies is complicated and time-consuming.  The deals announced this month are separate from a $25-billion settlement struck last February with five major banks by the federal government and 49 states. Those banks are Ally, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.  © Copyright (c) The Montreal Gazette',\n",
       " \"News Home buyers unfazed by fires AS THE mercury nudged 43 degrees, Allan Deadman sounded worried by the smoke he could see from Bendalong.  ''I'm just about to jump on the fire truck,'' said Mr Deadman, a real estate agent with Ray White in the south coast holiday hamlet and a volunteer firefighter.  Under threat were Bendalong, Sussex Inlet and Wandandian, and it was not a new experience.  The Black Christmas fires of 2001 - which raged for 17 days and destroyed 115 homes across NSW - struck the area. As with the fires of last week, Bendalong was spared destruction but holidaymakers slept on the beach as the flames edged closer to houses.  Whether there is a link between property price movements and the bushfire threat that many country towns face is inconclusive.  Bendalong's close call in 2001 and the burnt-out nearby national park might well have discouraged some buyers. The data from Australian Property Monitors, however, shows property buyers have short memories or are prepared to take the risk.  The median house price more than doubled from $205,000 to $422,000 between the boom years of 2001 and 2004.  But it has been a very different holiday house market in recent years, with prices falling.  Yet Mr Deadman does not expect last week's fire threat to affect a situation that has improved recently as vendors adjusted expectations, tempting holiday home hunters from Sydney. The $220,000 to $300,000 market was particularly strong, he said.  ''We've done three sales last week - we haven't exchanged yet - and we look like moving another two this weekend,'' he said.  The fire threat is also very real in the Blue Mountains.  In November 2006, blazes threatened Hazelbrook, Woodford and Linden.  Woodford's median house price fell 9.5 per cent over the next year, yet Hazelbrook's rose 3 per cent. There were too few sales in Linden to suggest a trend.  At Faulconbridge, which had also been under threat, prices dropped 3 per cent over the following year but leapt 6 per cent a year later.  APM was unable to determine a median price for the Victorian town of Marysville in 2010 that would reflect the degree of devastation brought by Black Saturday conflagrations of 2009, which destroyed many properties and killed 173 people.  Rod Evans, of Parkville, owned a two-bedroom 1930s fibro cottage in Murchison Street, Marysville, which was razed.  ''It was a weekender, so it's lucky we weren't there,'' he said. ''We had been intending to go there the following day.''  Mr Evans chose not to rebuild, instead buying elsewhere, but is only now getting round to selling the large block - for $205,000. He says it would suit a family home or even home units.  ''People who are rebuilding are putting up some very nice-looking houses and there's now some nice public facilities,'' Mr Evans said. ''Marysville is coming alive again.''  HOT . . . AND NOT\",\n",
       " 'News Florida Pension Sponsor Primes 1.7B Investments The Sunshine State\\'s State Board of Administration (SBA) incorporated more than $1.7 billion in new commitments, ranging from international developed and nontraditional strategies, when 2012\\'s fourth quarter concluded.  None of the investments caused a fatal blow to any current asset management contracts, \\xa0John Kuczwanski, communications manager at the agency, confirmed Wednesday.  According to the SBA\\'s reporting for 2012\\'s fourth quarter, about $50 million was committed to AQR Capital Management. The funds were directed to firm\\'s emerging market small-cap accounts. \\xa0  \"The global equity was made by rebalancing among managers to maintain appropriate diversification,\" Kuczwanski said.  With the remainder of the commitments, the pension manager for the Florida Retirement System (FRS) noted in its report that the remaining $1.2 billion was allocated to private equity, real estate and strategic investments.  Kuczwanski noted that the remainder of the commitments was sifted from the plan\\'s liquidity holding, with no managers facing terminations from the funding.  For private equity, the SBA further explained that about $104.6 million or ?80 million was allocated to Advent International\\'s GPE VII fund, and $100 million to each Silver Lake Partners\\' IV fund, Lexington Partners\\' Middle Market Investment III fund, EnerVest\\'s Energy IST Fund XIII-A, and EnCap Investments\\' Energy Capital Fund IX.  With the remaining investments, the SBA said that $100 million was also allocated to a real estate strategy managed by Starwood Capital Group and RK Equity\\'s RK Mine Finance Fund II, a strategic investment for the Tallahassee, Fla.-based retirement system.  Additional \"strategic\" commitments included $200 million each going to CarVal Investors\\' CVI Credit Value Fund II A, Scout Capital\\'s second fund, and GSO Capital Partners, the credit business of The Blackstone Group.  Alternately, Industry Funds Management was granted about $300 million to be allocated to a global infrastructure vehicle, and ABRY Partners was given a $60 million commitment.  Previously, Kuczwanksi said Oct. 9 that commitments made in the third quarter were \"funded from general liquidity.\" He noted that $1.3 billion in strategic, private equity and real estate investments make up a larger plan that includes goals laid out in the 2010 investment policy statement.  The pension plan manager\\'s goals stated the FRS was to raise its alternatives ceiling to 16%. The spokesperson said over the fall that the process was to be \"implemented in two phases.\"  \"The first phase was completed within prior statutory limits, with the final expansion requiring legislative authority to invest beyond the prior 10% cap on alternatives,\" he said Tuesday in an email. \"The expanded authority, from 10% to 20% (although we only plan to go to 16%) was passed during the latest legislative session ending March 2012.\"  As of Aug. 31, actual allocations included 4.7% to strategic investments, 5.2% to private equity and 7.5% to real estate. However, policy weights were situated at 11% for strategic, 5% for private equity and 7% for real estate.',\n",
       " 'Verizon CEO Sees More Than 130,000 New FiOS Customers in 4Q Hurricane cleanup, pension obligations and debt-restructuring costs will burden Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) with as much as $10 billion in one-time charges, Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told investors, though the carrier\\'s wireless segment continued to report strong growth.  Speaking to investors at Citi\\'s annual technology conference in Las Vegas, Mr. McAdam said the telecom provider\\'s Verizon Wireless subsidiary expects a net gain of 2.1 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, the best in its history. The company also added 130,000 new FiOS television subscriptions.  Verizon still expects heavy expenses borne during and after Hurricane Sandy, which slammed much of the heavily populated northeast U.S. and flooded the company\\'s New York headquarters.  \"We certainly took a hit because of Sandy,\" he said. \"For probably two months, the vast majority of our people were dedicated to the repair and the cleanup.\"  As part of its cleanup, Verizon has disclosed plans to pull out more than 130 tons of copper wiring from the affected area and replace it with fiber-optic cable to lower its long-term maintenance costs.  The chief executive Monday detailed more of the costs of those efforts, including a roughly $1 billion impact from the superstorm, a third of which should be covered by insurance. Verizon also expects a roughly $1.5 billion charge in the fourth quarter to restructure debt under more attractive lending terms, plus about $7 billion of mark-to-market losses associated with the company\\'s employee pension plan.  Total charges during the quarter could range between $9 billion and $10 billion, Mr. McAdam said.  Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett said the pension charge was large but not unexpected considering the company\\'s past guidance. Wireless subscriber growth beat Bernstein\\'s projections, however.  \"Verizon has been running the table in wireless, and everyone else is just struggling to stay in the game,\" Mr. Moffett said.  Verizon, like many of its peers, has shifted more investment to its wireless segment as mobile devices offer stronger growth prospects. Mr. McAdam still said recent union concessions should help the company\\'s wired telecom business increase its margins in the coming quarters.  Earlier, in an interview ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Mr. McAdam said Verizon could pull off the acquisition of its wireless joint venture with Vodafone Group PLC (VOD, VOD.LN).  \"We have always said we would love to own all of that asset,\" he said. He added, though, that the venture is functioning well and consolidation of the ownership isn\\'t necessary. Verizon Wireless is 55% owned by Verizon and 45% by Vodafone.  Shares of Verizon rose as high as 1.6% Monday before settling up 39 cents at $44.69. The stock has climbed 17% over the past year.

       " \"Calpers main fund posted 0.1 pct gain in fiscal 2011-12 SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System said on Thursday rates for its member agencies will increase after it posted a net investment return of 0.1 percent in its core fund for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, compared with a net return of 21.7 percent in the prior fiscal year.  Agencies using the retirement system to manage pension accounts have been expecting rate increases after it released a preliminary report in July on its disappointing 2011-2012 fiscal year performance.  That report said the system, best known as Calpers, posted a 1 percent gain for the year due to Europe's debt crisis and slowing global growth.  Calpers' board last March also put the system's member agencies on notice of rate increases by voting to lower its longstanding 7.75 percent assumed rate of return to 7.5 percent.  Calpers, the biggest U.S. public pension system, said on Thursday in its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report that net assets in its main fund, the Public Employees' Retirement Fund, totaled $237.0 billion at the end of its 2011-2012 fiscal year.  The value of Calpers' assets was $251.8 billion as of Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the retirement system.  Most contribution rates for state agency and school employers in the 2013-2014 fiscal year and for local government employers in the 2014-2015 fiscal year are not expected to increase by more than 2 percent of payroll, Calpers said in Thursday's report.  If Calpers earns its assumed 7.5 percent investment return in its 2012-2013 fiscal year, employer rates for state and school employers in its 2014-2015 fiscal year and for local agencies in its 2015-2016 fiscal year are expected to increase in most cases between 0.2 percent and 0.7 percent of payroll, the report said.  The rates could increase more if Calpers earns less than 7.5 percent, the report said.  Local governments using the Calpers system keep a close eye on the rates as pension costs have become a top financial concern in a time of tight public budgets across the most populous U.S. state.  San Bernardino, a city of 210,000 east of Los Angeles, has opted to withhold payments to Calpers while seeking bankruptcy court protection from its creditors.  A U.S. bankruptcy judge last month ruled against an attempt by Calpers to collect overdue payments from San Bernardino, the first city to halt payments to the fund and challenge its primacy as a creditor.  Stockton, California, also declared bankruptcy last year but has made payments in full to Calpers. Vallejo, California, also made its payments to Calpers during the course of its bankruptcy proceedings. Vallejo emerged from bankruptcy in 2011.

After all, no one knows their house like they do. By being there, they can tell potential buyers things that a realtor couldn\\'t possibly know. And, they can put a \"human\" touch on the showing. For example, they can talk about rocking their newborn son to sleep in his bedroom or serving their first Thanksgiving turkey in the dining room.  Real estate outlook: First time home buyers outlook for 2013  While all of that may sound nice on the surface, it can actually prevent your home from selling. According to Realtypin.com, the goal of the showing is for potential buyers to envision themselves living there. That\\'s impossible for them to do if you\\'re hovering over them like a cat eyeing a canary. It makes potential buyers feel like guests -- or worse, like they\\'re intruding on your personal space. They might even feel like you\\'re rushing them.  Movign to New York City? Check out the latest homes for sale in New York!  When people wind up in situations like that, they feel awkward. Unfortunately, they\\'re going to translate that feeling to the house itself. And, as you might have guessed, people don\\'t make offers on houses that make them feel awkward.  So, what can you do?  - Trust the realtor doing the showing. After all, this person is a professional. And, remember, the realtor has a stake in this, too. If the showing leads to a sale, the realtor gets a commission. So, it\\'s in the realtor\\'s best interest to talk up all of the good points about your home!  - Try to put yourself in the potential buyer\\'s shoes. What kind of environment would you want if you were touring a home for sale?  - Talk to your own realtor. Discuss the features that made you fall in love with your home. That way, your realtor can make sure that potential buyers know all about them.  Finally, if you insist on putting a more \"human\" touch on your home sale, don\\'t do it in person. Instead, leave a short handwritten note that highlights some of the great experiences you\\'ve had in the house. That way, potential buyers can read it during their showing, without the awkwardness of having you there to talk to them in person.

The four pension funds are part of two consortia that include three members each, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.  One consortium, advised by Macquarie Capital, is comprised of Alberta Investment Management Corp., Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Australia's QIC. The other, advised by J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets, is comprised of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Borealis Infrastructure, a unit of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, and Australia's Hastings Funds Management.  New South Wales Treasurer Mike Baird has estimated that leasing the ports will raise around 2.8 billion Australian dollars (US$2.96 billion)--A$2.3 billion for Port Botany and A$500 million for Port Kembla. The process is being led by Morgan Stanley.  A spokeswoman for Mr. Baird said the shortlisted parties were notified Wednesday, but she declined to give any details.  Final bids are due in early April, one of the people said. Mr. Baird said earlier this year that he hoped the process would be concluded by the middle of next year.  Port Botany handles more than US$40 billion of trade each year, from at least 2 million containers, making it the nation's second-largest container port by volume.  Port Kembla has been in operation since the 1890s. It is a hub for coal, steel and grain, and is the largest vehicle-importing terminal in Australia.  Eager to diversify their portfolios, Canadian pension funds have completed many overseas deals in recent years, turning to infrastructure assets because they offer stable returns compared with equities and commodities.  Australia is an attractive destination because a commodities-and-energy boom has helped shield its economy from the headwinds buffeting other developed regions such as the U.S. and Europe.  The nation's six states must raise their own money to pay for infrastructure not funded by the federal government, and to pay state workers such as bus drivers and bureaucrats.  Queensland and South Australia have recently come under pressure from ratings firms over their ailing finances.  Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services gave New South Wales's infrastructure-privatization plan a broad tick, so its triple-A rating remains secure for now.

       " 'YOUR MONEY-Best 401(k) plans take fees into consideration NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Much of what makes a great retirement plan depends upon the cost to participants and the generosity of the company to its workers.  These are among the criteria that BrightScope uses to rank the top 30 401(k) plans at big companies with more than $1 billion in plan assets. The financial information service also look at participation rates, level of salary deferrals and average account balances, to come up with its list of the best among the 429 largest 401(k) plans.  \"Less-obvious 401k plan components like immediate plan eligibility and vesting significantly increase participation rates and therefore employees\\' chances of a secure financial future,\" says Mike Alfred, CEO and co-founder of BrightScope, which rates more than 46,000 retirement plans.  Some plan design features were common: Costs averaged 0.29 percent, a drop of 1.5 basis points since 2010. Twenty-four of the top 30 had immediate eligibility. Also, 21 of the plans offered immediate vesting of company match contributions.  For investing options, more participants are picking index funds, now accounting for 29.5 percent of assets, in contrast to 25.4 percent in 2010. Collective trusts - which pool together assets are also popular, at 28.7 percent of assets, in contrast to 24 percent in 2010. Also growing: target date funds, up to 4.9 percent from 3.6 percent in 2012.  The top company was a newcomer to the list, Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan, of Houston, Texas. The company matches 100 percent of the first 7 percent contributed to the plan, with an average contribution level of more than $23,000 per participant. BrightScope notes, \"This generosity, in turn, helped push the average salary deferral for the plan to over $38,000 per participant.\"  Among notable major companies, Google Inc., came in at 11 and IBM at 14. The financial services industry was also well-represented with Credit Suisse (7), The Roche (18), Ernst & Young (19), UBS (24), Goldman Sachs (27) and Deloitte (30) on the list.

       " 'Business & Technology Air Canada seeks pension relief; Staring down $4.2-billion pension deficit, airline asks finance minister for help Air Canada wants to cap special payments toward its pension fund deficit at $150 million a year for the next decade, a letter from chief executive officer Calin Rovinescu to Finance Minister Jim Flaherty shows.  The April 26 letter, received by Reuters on Thursday under access-to-information legislation, formally requested a cap of that amount from 2014 through 2023, as long as the pension fund remained in deficit.  Air Canada has already won approval from its labour unions and its pensioners for a cap, but as recently as Nov. 8, Rovinescu declined in a conference call with analysts to confirm that the amount of the cap he was seeking was $150 million.  Rovinescu said the $2.2 billion increase in Air Canada\\'s pension deficit during 2011 was the result of a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate pension liabilities, to 3.3 per cent from 4.5 per cent.  \"This is not sustainable in the current context, assuming no material increase in interest rates,\" Rovinescu wrote to Flaherty.  He said the increase brought the total deficit to $4.4 billion. The airline, Canada\\'s largest, has subsequently revised that down to $4.2 billion.  Air Canada, like other employers with defined-benefit pension plans, has been badly hurt by the decline in the interest rates that are used to calculate solvency gaps.  All but seven per cent of Canada\\'s federally regulated, private defined-benefit plans were underfunded at the end of 2011, the federal supervisor said on Oct. 5.  In his conference call with analysts on Nov. 8, Rovinescu said, \"We have no assurance of being able to get anything along the lines of what has been asked\" for a cap on the special pension payments. \"I think that there were some references that were made in the arbitration materials that talked about the numbers along the lines of what you\\'ve indicated.  \"We\\'re not able to confirm that\\'s been granted, and so we\\'re hopeful of having funding that\\'s satisfactory, but until it\\'s done, it\\'s not done.\"  Following approval by the unions and pensioners for the cap, the airline is now awaiting Flaherty\\'s decision on whether to approve it. Flaherty\\'s office has so far declined to hint when he will decide.  In 2009, Air Canada won agreement from the government for a moratorium on making any special payments to reduce its pension deficit through 2010, and then a cap on special payments that would rise from $150 million in 2011 to $225 million in 2013.  Justifying his request, Rovinescu told the finance minister how the airline had \"worked diligently to address our pension solvency challenges.\" The pension plans have delivered top quartile performance in the past three years, he said.  Mark Blinch, Reuters / Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu says the company\\'s underfunded pension plans have performed well recently.;',\n",

County Commission chairman Mike Ritz proposed the tax as a way to help offset an anticipated $57 million budget deficit for the merged city and county school system.

The plan for the new school system should be based on reality, not some idealized world-class system as now envisioned. Start with the basics first, then grow it. ...  Then, come back to the taxpayers and ask for new funding. That would stand a chance of approval. ...

       " 'Ask Amy Lifestyle Long-ago affair now too close to home DEAR AMY: I was involved with a married man for more than 15 years. He was going to leave his wife to be with me, but it never happened. I was naive and thought he was serious about our relationship because we saw each other morning, noon and night. We had so much in common and enjoyed every minute we were together.  After the affair ended, we remained good friends. We still have friends in common and communicate by cellphone. He stops by my house on a regular basis. Recently, he told me that he and his wife were going to downsize to a smaller house. He owns a lot of land and there are a lot of places he could build his \"retirement home,\" but he tells me it will be on property adjacent to me!  What kind of man would do something like that? His wife doesn\\'t like me, but she has no idea about the extent of my relationship with her husband. My neighbours and friends who knew about our relationship have said that he should have picked another location. They think that he is being self-centred and inconsiderate of my feelings.  I am still reeling from this. What do you imagine he is thinking?  -- FRUSTRATED FORMER  DEAR FRUSTRATED: You claim that after your sexual affair ended you maintained a long-term friendship with this man, entertaining him in your home and talking frequently on the phone.  I suspect your former flame imagines that he can continue to be your friend, only now from next door. If you don\\'t want him to build a house next to you, it would be a good idea to stop discussing this with mutual friends and start discussing this with him. He doesn\\'t sound like someone who has much respect for boundaries, but you should do your best to draw them now.

       " 'MARKETS & INVESTING Homeowners snap up low-rate US loans American homeowners are rushing to refinance mortgages at near-historic low rates, with loan applications last week staying close to three-year highs.  Traders and loan originators are awaiting more signals from the Federal Reserve, which is now the biggest buyer of wholesale mortgages, that could prompt a big increase in the amount of mortgages available at ultra-low rates.  A slight decline in applications last week reflected a modest rebound in mortgage rates and a debate in financial markets about how much further rates could fall. After the Fed announced on September 13 that it would buy an unlimited amount of mortgage-backed securities at a rate of about $70bn a month until unemployment came down, mortgage refinance applications surged to their highest levels since 2009, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.  The number of refinancing applications declined 2 per cent last week, after a 20 per cent jump in the previous seven days. The number of mortgage applications overall, including for new home purchases, was down 1.2 per cent. \"Volume is still near three-year highs, and purchase applications increased to the highest level since June,\" said Mike Fratantoni, the MBA\\'s vice-president of research and economics.  The level of refinancings is critical to the effectiveness of the Fed\\'s bond-buying programme, since they could put additional money in homeowners\\' pockets and help boost demand in the economy. By bringing down mortgage rates, the Fed is also hoping to stoke a housing market recovery.  However, the initial downward pressure on mortgage rates appears to have eased somewhat. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage guaranteed by the government agency Freddie Mac fell to a record low of 3.36 per cent last week, from 3.55 per cent before the Fed\\'s quantitative easing programme was announced. The latest weekly figure is published by the agency on Thursday.  HSH, a private organisation that also tracks mortgage rates on a daily basis, has seen a rebound in rates. It is currently showing an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3.53 per cent, up from a trough of 3.39 per cent. MBS traders believe that a step-change lower in rates could only come if the Fed moves to make substantial purchases of ultra-low rate loans in the wholesale market.  New MBS are pre-sold in buckets divided according to the coupon, or rate, and the Fed\\'s buying activity has so far been concentrated in these so-called \"pass throughs\" with a coupon of 3 per cent or above. However, a recent surge in activity in purchases of 2.5 per cent pass-throughs suggests the Fed has begun buying at these new low levels.  On Tuesday, $617m of 2.5 per cent pass-throughs traded, according to FINRA data, more than twice the ten-day average. The trades help set a price, and prove demand for mortgages with ultra-low rates.',\n",
       " \"Local CPA call to quash lump-sum mentality THE $30 billion in tax breaks for Australia's compulsory superannuation scheme is failing to take pressure off the age pension and the federal budget as retiring baby boomers take lump-sum entitlements to pay off their mortgages instead of funding their retirement.  A report to be released today by CPA Australia suggests the nation is headed for a retirement savings ``disaster'' and calls on the government to examine placing limits on access to lump-sum payments upon retirement.  The report Household Savings and Retirement, compiled by Simon Kelly, the former principal research fellow in the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra, found superannuation was being used by retirees to extinguish debt accumulated during their working lives to allow them to live beyond their income levels.  The report comes as the federal government canvasses the superannuation industry for potential savings as it seeks to compensate for lower revenues caused by the lower commodity prices and a raft of new spending promises.  Speculation has centred on whether the government might curb tax breaks on super for high-income earners or narrow tax breaks for borrowing on property through self-managed super funds.  People approaching retirement age were using the equity in the family home as a source of funds to assist their children into home ownership, to fund an overseas trip, retire early or simply to live a lifestyle their income could not support, rather than saving it as a retirement nest egg.  This was adding to an unrealistic expectation of retirement  lifestyle.  The report also warns that higher household incomes, with both partners working, access to easy credit and asset inflation had increased retirement expectations, but the current system would not be able to deliver these higher expectations.  ``This study is a stark illustration that the superannuation system, as currently configured, has failed miserably in its aim of encouraging more Australians to save for retirement,'' CPA Australia chief executive Alex Malley said.  ``Many who have spent a large portion of their working lives under this system will still be relying on the pension.''  The report, to be released today by Australia's largest accounting body, found average household superannuation balances grew 42 per cent between 2002 and 2010, while non-superannuation financial assets grew by 17 per cent and property assets by 60 per cent at the same time as property debt grew by 94 per cent and other debt grew by 50 per cent.  The study suggested that each dollar contributed to compulsory superannuation was offset by a 30 per cent reduction in other savings.  ``The results could not be clearer,'' Mr Malley said. ``Australian taxpayers are facing a massive bill.''  Mr Malley said given the compulsory nature of the scheme it would be worth considering the use of compulsory income streams in retirement and moves away from the ``lump sum as windfall'' mentality that could be blamed for the riskier investment and spending behaviour.\",\n",

Another staff member was making an urgent delivery, so for 15 minutes I was alone in the pharmacy - a situation that could become the norm judging by recent financial announcements.  The NHS cut to our payments is the equivalent to the cost of employing two full-time technicians. Or I could stop my pension payments and take a 6 per cent pay cut.

Because that\\'s how I feel having seen the PSNC so-say negotiated so-called interim agreement - the sort of interim arrangement that turkeys agree at Christmas.  Yes, we all know the NHS needs to make umpteen billion pounds savings, but those savings were to be made by having no increase in funding. It seems now that, single-handedly, pharmacy is funding the whole bloody deficit itself and I\\'ll need a back-up pension plan.  And if I\\'m thinking this way, how much greater will be the need to slash and burn costs if you have shareholders to satisfy? Or high overheads such as a 100-hour contract?

I\\'m so angry I\\'m not even going to ask about fairness because fairness stopped years ago, but what I do expect is a bit of honesty from the Department of Health. Having been persuaded to end the 100-hour exemption by - in part - the argument around cost, are they now planning savings by reducing contract numbers? Will they be truthful and say: \"We\\'re going to make it uneconomical to own a pharmacy until enough contracts have shut down, the surplus of corpses with certificates means pharmacist pay rates will match that in Northern Ireland, and the responsible pharmacist will be the one who pulls plastic sheeting over his cardboard box before going to sleep.\"  Of course, I realise we\\'ve been here before. I\\'ve lost count of the times we\\'ve been going to financial hell in a handcart, yet I can still afford to put claret on the dinner table and pharmacy agents still report healthy sales of sound businesses. No, the real problem is uncertainty - the very \\'interim\\' nature of the agreement as the cost of service inquiry approaches its third birthday, and the rumours of a new contract.  Instead of all these temporary measures we need surety of income over at least five years so we can plan and invest, because the financial alternative to that is to gamble - which gets you nowhere.

       " 'Business News Estate tax change would affect 12.3M households HARTFORD, Conn. - An additional 12.3 million households in the U.S. would have a potential tax liability if the Bush-era estate tax rates expire as scheduled on Dec. 31, according to research released Tuesday by the life-insurance trade group LIMRA of Windsor, Conn.  The current estate tax means that about 2.4 million of the wealthiest U.S. households face a potential tax liability at death, but if the current law expires at the end of the year, 14.7 million households could face an estate tax, LIMRA reports.  At issue is the ongoing debate by members of Congress about the future of all tax rates. The federal estate tax is a one-time tax on real estate, life insurance, trusts, annuities, business interests, cash, securities and other assets transferred through a person\\'s will at the time of his or her death, usually to children or other family members.  The vast majority of Americans would still be exempt from an estate tax even if it reverts to higher rates. The higher rates, if the current rate expires, would affect about 12.5 percent of U.S. households. The current rate affects about 2 percent of households.  The current rate exempts the first $5 million in assets, and the rest is subject to a tax rate up to 35 percent. If the law expires and Congress doesn\\'t act to extend it, or to modify the changes scheduled for Dec. 31, the exemption would drop to the first $1 million in assets and the rest could be taxed up to 55 percent.  Some in Congress have mentioned a possible compromise plan of exempting the first $3.5 million and taxing up to 45 percent for assets beyond that.  The $1 million threshold is the total of all assets - such as the total of a $450,000 house and $550,000 in retirement savings, ownership of a business, stocks, cash, secondary property and other assets.  If the current estate tax law is extended, 2.4 million of the wealthiest U.S. households would have a potential estate tax liability. At 35 percent, the average estate tax would be $2.4 million.  If the rate expires, the 14.7 million households facing a potential estate tax liability would have an average tax of $1.4 million at death.  LIMRA is not proposing a particular rate, but the trade group is advocating for some stability in the tax code.  \"The uncertainty that has surrounded our estate tax laws has made it impossible for Americans to plan for a reasonable transition of their assets to the ones they love and to charity for the greater good,\" said Robert Kerzner, president and CEO of LIMRA, LOMA and LL Global.  \"Until we have long-term clarity on what the law will be, American families and small businesses will be challenged to make the prudent decisions to ensure their beneficiaries are protected,\" Kerzner said.',\n",
       " 'Gloves come off in ETF price war The ongoing price war among providers of\\xa0exchange-traded funds\\xa0is heating up.  The Charles Schwab Corp. last Friday unveiled a round of fee cuts aimed at making its ETFs the lowest-cost funds in their categories. The move came just weeks after BlackRock Inc. said that it would implement strategic fee cuts in its iShares ETFs, the largest family of ETFs, with more than $500 billion in assets.  Both firms are following the lead of The Vanguard Group Inc., which has employed its emphasis on low-cost products to become the fastest-growing ETF firm in the industry.  The $1.13 billion Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB), for example, now costs 4 basis points, down from 6. It is now 2 basis points cheaper than the $23 billion Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).  TARGETING CUTS  Schwab also is following BlackRock\\'s lead in targeting fee cuts to the asset classes in which both companies compete with Vanguard.  Neither BlackRock nor Schwab is particularly hurting for attention. The iShares ETFs have had inflows of $63 billion over the past three years, second only to Vanguard\\'s $73 billion, and Schwab\\'s ETF business has grown to $7.5 billion since its launch in November 2009.  But in the core building-block-type ETFs, cost tends to matter most.  \"They\\'re commodity-type products,\" said Mike Rawson, an ETF analyst at Morningstar Inc. \"The disparity between one index provider and another in those categories isn\\'t that great, so people just tend to go with the cheapest.\"  Of course, because ETFs already have low fees, 1 or 2 basis points may not seem like a big difference. But without the fee cuts, BlackRock and Schwab could have risked losing investors to Vanguard because, thanks to the firm\\'s unique structure, Vanguard can continue to lower prices.  Vanguard is owned by its funds - thus the shareholders of those funds - so expense ratios are kept at cost. As the funds grow larger, expense ratios fall because of economies of scale.  Because Vanguard\\'s ETFs are share classes of its index funds, inflows into the index funds will allow ETF expense ratios to keep dropping.  Two-thirds of Vanguard ETFs have had fees cut over the past year, according to the company.  BlackRock hasn\\'t been specific about its fee cuts, but Schwab seems committed to following Vanguard all the way down to the bottom.  \"I\\'ll leave it to your imagination as to how we might respond to followers who, late to the game, attempt to undercut our exceptional pricing,\" said Marie Chandoha, president of Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc.  So far, Vanguard doesn\\'t seem to be worried.  \"We\\'re happy other companies are following our lead,\" said spokesman David Hoffman. \"Lowering fees is something organic for us, and it will most likely happen again in the future.\"  Christine Hudacko, a spokeswoman for BlackRock, declined to comment.

       " 'News; News New York Life Gives American College $5M for Ph.D. Program New York Life announced Monday that it has awarded The American College $5 million to set up a new 12-course Ph.D. program in business administration-the only one of its kind-so that advisors can hone their skills in financial literacy and retirement planning.  The American College will begin accepting applications for the Ph.D. program in October.  Chris Blunt, president of New York Life\\'s Insurance Group, said in a statement that \"New York Life is proud to establish this much-needed doctorate program to enhance the services provided by financial professionals.\" The doctoral program, he said, will include an \"unrivaled curriculum of financial literacy and retirement planning, designed to create world-class scholars whose research and teaching will provide financial professionals with the advanced information needed to better serve the people who are counting on them.\"  Blunt went on to note the crucial need for professional advice as Baby Boomers, who number about 77 million and who started turning 65 years old last year, \"are facing a retirement that has drastically changed from the retirement of generations before them.\" Without the promise of a pension and the certainty of a \"healthy\" Social Security benefit, Blunt added that \"many retirees need to more actively manage their income and pre-retirees need to better prepare for retirement,\" and that \"many are in need of financial guidance and seek a knowledgeable professional.\"  Dr. Larry Barton, president and CEO of The American College, said in the same statement that graduates of the doctorate program will \"create and disseminate the results of advanced research\" in the area of financial services and retirement planning. \"This new knowledge could have a profound impact on consumers and help millions of Americans achieve financial security during their golden years,\" he said.  Applicants must have a bachelor\\'s degree from an accredited school and meet other qualifying requirements. Once students are accepted, the college says it will identify two cohort groups, each made up of 15 people, who will move through the coursework together on a mutually supportive basis. One cohort group would begin studies every six months, and the first residency is scheduled for July 2013.  Doctoral scholars will participate in three one-week residencies at The American College\\'s campus in Bryn Mawr, Pa., as well as at least one intensive debrief with faculty prior to their dissertation defense. Students are required to complete one course per quarter online over 12 quarters in addition to the residencies.   In late August, The American College announced it had developed a new designation, called the Retirement Income Certified Professional, or RICP.  In 2007, New York Life donated $2 million to establish the New York Life Center for Retirement Income at The American College to help address the demand for income solutions among retired Americans.  Those interested in the Ph.D. program can contact Nancy Krapf at 610-526-1202 or visit www.TheAmericanCollege.edu.',\n",
       " \"A fund of one How one US pension plan is revising the definition of a 'commingled' fund to speed up investment  Finding ways of investing faster appears to be rife among US pension plans at the minute. Note last month's procedural shift by the Nebraska Investment Council, which removed the need for board approval for certain repeat commitments. The reasoning for the expedited process was to better enable the pension system to invest in vehicles prior to the first close, when better fees and terms are sometimes offered. If you ever wanted an indicator of how hot the US real estate market has become, measures likes these are surely one.  In addition, since the Nebraska case came to light, another one has cropped up. As PERE reported this week, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) has made a $100 million commitment to CityView Bay Area II.  This might seem like a run-of-the-mill commitment to a commingled fund. Indeed, that is what LACERA calls it. However, upon closer inspection, it much more closely resembles a separate account. There is only one limited partner, LACERA, and the pension plan has complete control over areas such as general partner termination, fund extensions and cessation of investment period. It also has retained the right to own the projects outright upon completion as long-term core assets and already has drawn up a true separate account management agreement with CityView to be used if and when it acquires full interests.  So, why hasn't LACERA just committed to a separate account rather than what it technically defines as commingled fund? The answer is the need for speed.  If LACERA had made this commitment as a separate account, it would first have had to go through a time-consuming request for proposal (RFP) process that typically requires six to nine months to complete. However, it doesn't want to miss out on opportunities now.  Still, there is no 'legal' definition for what constitutes a commingled fund. In addition, unlike some investors, LACERA does not have a limit on the percentage of a commingled fund that its investment can represent.  It's also important to note that not all state pension plans are subject to RFP processes for separate account managers or other real estate hires One large public pension that PERE spoke with has made its multiple separate account manager hires without putting mandates out for public bid. For LACERA, the need to engage in an RFP process becomes an additional hurdle and potentially puts it at a competitive disadvantage. This unique fund structure is one way for the pension plan to level the playing field without breaking the rules.  Of course, not all pension funds in the US will be following suit in finding ways to expedite the investment process. However, with the US market appearing so hot right now and investors not wishing to be too late to opportunities, one can expect more pension plans to find ways to be more nimble.\",\n",
       " 'News Compulsory pension for West workers Around 677,000 workers in the South West will automatically pay into a company pension under Government plans to avert mass hardship in retirement.  From October 1, staff working for large firms and not currently in a workplace scheme will see pay reduced by 1%, with the cash placed into savings and matched by the employer.  The move will affect people earning more than the income tax threshold, which is currently £8,105. Small firms will not be involved until June 2015 at the earliest.  In the greater South West, just 41% of private sector workers, or 471,000 people, make payments into a workplace pension scheme. The figure has fallen sharply since 2002, when 57% paid into a company scheme.  The number of private sector workers paying into pension schemes has plummeted to its lowest level since records began in 1953.  Around nine-in-ten public sector workers have a staterun scheme, meaning the reform will largely affect the private sector.  The automatic enrolment scheme, which has been described as the biggest pensions shake-up in more than a century, aims to tackle concerns about a growing old age poverty crisis, as people are living for longer but failing to put away enough for their later years.  Workers can choose to opt out of the scheme once they have been enrolled under \"soft compulsion\". The Government believes less than onethird will opt-out. Employers will eventually contribute 3% of earnings, individuals 4% of earnings, and there will also be 1% from the Government to make up a total contribution of 8%.  Pensions Minister Steve Webb told the Western Morning News: \"We\\'ve got millions and millions of people who don\\'t have a pension, so when they retire they will get a pension from the state and not much else. They will be on a very low standard of living in retirement. \"If we do nothing, fewer and fewer people will have a workbased pensions and will retire into poverty. We can\\'t really think of any other way of enabling these millions of workers to retire with a decent standard of living. We could force them to save, which reduces the freedom of choice. We could tax everybody and have a much higher state pension.  This seems to us the right balance.\"  Asked whether the timing was inconvenient as Britain remains in recession and households are struggling to pay bills, he said: \"There\\'s never a great time to do this. It\\'s already been delayed quite significantly. It\\'s been talked about for years and years.\"  Anne Marie Morris, Conservative MP for Newton Abbot, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Micro Businesses, said she was pleased so many South West workers would be paying into a pension. But she added: \"It is important that our small and micro businesses receive the help they will need to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits auto-enrolment will bring.\"',\n",
       " 'Three Tips For Building A Lasting Retirement MILWAUKEE, Sept. 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Retirement planning is constantly changing making it necessary to have a solid retirement strategy. In the past, many could rely on pension plans and social security benefits, but pension plans are increasingly rare(1) and Social Security benefits should not be used as a sole source of retirement.  Many Americans are at risk of running out of money in retirement. According to a recent Employee Benefit Research Institute study (EBRI), nearly 47 percent of early baby boomers (ages 56 to 62) are at risk of outliving their retirement savings. \"To develop a sustainable strategy that meets your specific needs, some important considerations would be your age at retirement, life expectancy, living expenses and the rate of return you expect from your investments,\" said Dean Urbanski, Vice President, BMO Harris Financial Advisors, Inc., a part of BMO Financial Group.  Here are a few tips from Urbanksi on planning for retirement.      -- Withdrawal Strategy: Knowing how much money should be withdrawn from your        retirement savings each year is a critical factor in building a        retirement plan. Withdraw too much and you are likely to outlive your        assets; take too little and you may unnecessarily sacrifice your standard        of living, especially in the early years of retirement.       -- Asset Allocation: As individuals seek increased income upon entering        retirement, they often shift their holdings more toward bonds and cash.        This may or may not be a good move, as there are other key investment        considerations beyond having a need for income. Confer with your        financial advisor to determine the appropriate allocation for your needs,        investment objective, risk profile and timeframe.       -- A core of guaranteed income: In retirement your focus will need to shift        to using your savings to generate income to meet your ongoing expenses.        One possible option is to allocate a portion of your savings to an        annuity. Annuities are an investment tool that can provide guaranteed        income for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live.   Said Urbanksi, \"Whatever your specific plans, it\\'s crucial that you enter retirement with a strategy for turning your savings into a retirement \\'paycheck\\' that will allow you to live retirement on your own terms.\" To learn how to begin, contact your BMO Harris Financial Advisor or visit www.bmoharris.com/financialadvisors.

       " 'Certified COBRA Administrator COBRAGuard Inc. Awarded Contract with State of North Carolina OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Sept. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- After a transparent and highly competitive bid process, the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees awarded benefits administration contracts to five companies, including Kansas City-based COBRAGuard. The state provides benefits for approximately 664,000 people. With this decision, it expects to save $22.4 million, roughly 19 percent, compared to last year.  COBRAGuard will take over as the state\\'s new COBRA administration partner effective July 1, 2013, and will serve for a contracted term of three and a half years. The company will provide a full range of COBRA administration and direct billing services. The contract is valued at approximately $1.2 million annually.  \"We are delighted to be chosen as North Carolina\\'s COBRA administration partner,\" COBRAGuard President Robert Meyers said. \"Our goal is to help the state save time and operate efficiently, while delivering exceptional service and secure online account access for COBRA participants. The state was able to drive down costs by splitting the administration contract between several highly efficient, niche-focused companies. Other public entities should consider North Carolina\\'s innovative strategy.\"  COBRAGuard has a long history of successfully serving public entities. The company serves more than 1,000 cities, counties, municipalities, school districts and universities across the nation, with the addition of North Carolina. In 2011, the company announced the formation of a public entity division. Meyers serves as a councilman for the city of Roeland Park, Kan., so he has firsthand understanding of public entity challenges and a unique desire to help them thrive. \"At COBRAGuard, we don\\'t see ourselves as vendors,\" Meyers said. \"We are highly engaged and adaptable problem solvers who extend the capabilities of the organizations we serve.\"  Outsourcing benefit management is becoming more common, said Jan White, president of the Society for Human Resource Management of Greater Kansas City. White also is HR director for the Visiting Nurse Association of Kansas City. \"COBRA is just one of those regulations that a lot of people find cumbersome to manage, and if you can outsource it, that frees you up for other tasks,\" White said in the September 7 edition of the Kansas City Business Journal.  \"Public and private organizations understand that it\\'s inefficient to continuously invest in the training, legal review and documentation needed to properly administer COBRA,\" Meyers said. \"It\\'s considerably more cost-effective to outsource COBRA administration to experts -- particularly now that we\\'re operating in the age of health care reform with a constantly evolving landscape.\"  About COBRAGuard Inc.

       " 'News; News California\\'s Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a hotly contested pension reform bill whose impact on public employees may signal a new era in DB and health care coverage nationwide.  Reuters notes that Brown\\'s new legislation will raise the minimum retirement ages for many public employees as well as reducing pension benefits for all new workers.  \"Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system,\" Brown said, in a statement. The law, he adds, is the \"biggest rollback to public pensions in the history of California pensions.\"  California\\'s new rules come admit tremendous economic and political pressure to curtail the escalating costs of DB plans and post-retirement benefits for public employees, both in that state and across the U.S.  But California\\'s pressures have been stronger, with several major cities claiming or teetering on the verge of bankrupcy as they find it impossible to meet their pension obligations, in part due to long-term national economic issues.  The state\\'s two biggest pension funds, the California Public Employees\\' Retirement System and the California State Teachers\\' Retirement System, are at least $165 million underfunded.  And normally left-leaning, worker-friendly cities including San Jose and San Diego have also joined the fray, with voters supporting measures to limit pension benefits for existing workers and retirees and drastically reduce services to new hires - votes which are being contested in court by public safety employee unions.  Under Brown\\'s new legistlation, new hires will evenly split payments to their pension accounts with their employers, and other government employers will have more leverage to ask the same of current employees, upping their required contributions. Park rangers, game wardens and firefighters will now have to pay more of their own benefits.  The legislation also launches new formulas for calculating future pension benefits for new employees.  As a spin-off to the pension legislation, Moody\\'s Investors Service said the action will go far to increasing California\\'s overall credit rating, currently listed as A1.  The Associated Press notes that the bill did not include a hybrid-styled system Brown had championed which would add a 401(k)-style system so public employees would bear some of the investment risk, as private-sector workers do.  As well, nothing was done to contain the health care costs promised to retiring workers, and there are still no indendent members with financial experties on the board of the state\\'s main pension fund.  \"Yes, it\\'s not everything. It\\'s not perfection,\" Brown told reporters in Los Angeles. \"But in politics we don\\'t deal with perfection. These are hard fought. These aren\\'t that easy.\"  California\\'s public employees\\' system estimates the changes will save between $42 billion and $50 billion over 30 years, while the teachers\\' system estimated its savings at $22.7 billion over 30 years.',\n",
       " 'Banking, Financial Services; Prudential reports higher rate taxpayers reject (GBP)438 million in tax relief 2012 SEP 8 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News -- One in four higher rate taxpayers do not contribute to pension schemes despite the attraction of tax relief to help boost their retirement savings, according to independent research from Prudential*. Nationally, this equates to around 216,000 employees missing out on up to (GBP)438 million a year in pension tax relief.  The nationwide study of those earning between (GBP)42,275 and (GBP)149,999 found 21 per cent claiming they cannot afford to contribute to a pension scheme. One in eight (13 per cent) say they do not see the point of saving for retirement, despite the tax benefits of pensions, while 17 per cent don\\'t know why they fail to save into a pension scheme.  An average higher rate taxpayer contributing (GBP)425 a month into a pension fund receives basic rate tax relief of (GBP)85 a month or (GBP)1,020 a year, directly into their pension fund. Up to an additional (GBP)1,020 a year in higher rate tax relief can be claimed, which could also be used for pension saving.  Figures from HMRC show that around 58 per cent of the estimated 900,000 higher rate taxpayers in the UK contribute to defined contribution pension schemes, while another 15 per cent are members of either non-contributory or defined benefit schemes.  But despite earning average salaries of (GBP)58,541, the rest do not save into pension schemes at all. Around 43 per cent of those who don\\'t save into a pension scheme claim to have made alternative retirement arrangements, 4 per cent have existing Self-Invested Personal Pension schemes and another 2 per cent claim they will not retire.  Matthew Stephens, Prudential\\'s tax expert, said: \"Pension saving offers valuable tax reliefs to all workers and particularly to higher rate taxpayers. Basic rate 20 per cent tax relief is available at source plus up to an extra 20 per cent from HMRC for higher rate taxpayers. Turning down what is effectively free money simply does not make sense.  \"It is worrying that so many higher rate taxpayers say they cannot afford to save into a pension despite earning healthy salaries. The good news is that it is never too late to take action on saving for retirement and we urge all workers to seek advice on long-term retirement planning\"  The Prudential research shows that recent changes limiting annual tax-free pension contributions to (GBP)50,000 a year have not significantly dented pension saving among higher earners. Just 8 per cent said the change had put them off pension saving while 25 per cent were unaware of the change.

       " \"Party conferences promise to turn up the heat on pensions With MPs back from their holidays soon, pensions will once again become a political battlefield. With the political conference season not far away, here's how I predict pensions will be tackled in the conference halls in Brighton, Birmingham and Manchester.  Auto-enrolment will kick off on 1 October, nestled nicely between the Liberal Democrat and Conservative party conferences. Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb will joke that in this Olympics year the biggest event is yet to begin. He will argue the inclusion of the very smallest and poorest savers is a victory for Lib Dem values against self-interested private sector providers.  Tory chancellor George Osborne will praise auto-enrolment as a fix for Britain's broken savings culture. He will boast about bringing the cost of public sector pensions under control. Hoping to make up for his granny tax blunder, he will announce help for tomorrow's pensioners with a £35,000 cap on long-term care costs.  Silence on state pensions reform  What about what the politicians will not say? I predict they will remain silent on state pensions reform. A coalition policy announcement on this is long overdue.  The Department for Work and Pensions has so far promised a white paper on the £140-a-week flat rate state pension will be published 'later this year'. By staying silent on this, and with auto-enrolment about to begin, the government will expose itself to the accusation it is forcing people to save into pension pots, only to be caught by the current complex and unfair means-testing system.  'I am quite concerned the state pension paper is not appearing,' says Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown. 'Auto-enrolment begins on 1 October, so it needs to be out before then. That is when we will start seeing media awareness and consumer interest increase, so it needs to be put to rest, unless they want people saying their pension will disappear with means-testing.'  Pensions charges concerns  Labour shadow pensions minister Gregg McClymont is likely to take the lead on a pension charges ticket. McClymont wants restrictions removed from the National Employment Savings Trust (Nest) and will no doubt chide the government and private sector over that. He also has the ear of leader Ed Miliband on the issue of 'hidden costs' associated with pension investments.  Independent pensions expert Ros Altmann says the pension charges debate has an 'air of unreality'. For her, the key issue is the massively detrimental effect that quantitative easing (QE) is having on annuity rates. Yet the policy of buying up government bonds is broadly supported by all three parties.  'The great unspoken in all of this is what happens when we take an income and what the government has done to the annuity market through QE,' she says. 'Auto-enrolment savings will not materialise. Modest contributions will not deliver much pension, even with great returns, because annuity rates are so poor.'\",\n",

       " 'Business Receivers move in on Carroll ULSTER BANK has appointed receivers to Zelderbridge, a Liam Carroll company with ?985m in bank loans and a deficit of nearly ?600m.  Accounts show the company issued ?27m in unguaranteed loans to Carroll\\'s pension fund and companies controlled by the developer during the property bubble. It is understood that about ?15m of the total went into Carroll\\'s pension pot.  Carroll was one of the most active developers during the building boom, but his empire is being dismantled, with multi-billion-euro debts.  A subsidiary of Zelderbridge made the interest-free payments to Carroll\\'s pension and to businesses he controlled, according to company filings. The loans were issued by Rambridge, an unlimited Irish company that does not have to file publicly available accounts. Its parent company, Wainsford Investments, is incorporated in Jersey.  Zelderbridge is a central company in Carroll\\'s group with more than 60 subsidiaries, including the Dunloe Ewart group, which Carroll acquired in 2002. It also owns the companies behind the Cherrywood Science and Technology Park in south Dublin. The company took in ?20.4m in rent and management fees in 2010 but made a pre-tax loss of ?42m after writing down the value of its properties and paying an interest bill of ?33m. Its property portfolio was valued at ?460m at the end of 2010, less than half the amount it owed the banks.  More than ?200m of Zelderbridge\\'s loans have transferred to the National Asset Management Agency (Nama), and the company has submitted a detailed business plan to the agency.  Zelderbridge has borrowings with several non-Nama banks, including Ulster Bank, KBC, National Irish Bank and Bank of Scotland (Ireland).  Ulster Bank installed Paul McCann and Patrick Dillon of Grant Thornton as receivers at Zelderbridge last week using a charge that had been registered in April. The receivership was necessary to facilitate the sale of a former Carroll building and site at Sir John Rogerson\\'s Quay on the south docks in Dublin.  The eight-storey office block, occupied by financial adviser State Street, and an adjoining three-acre site, were put on the market last week for ?105m. State Street is paying ?7.8m a year in rent under a 25-year lease signed in 2009.  Carroll had planned to build a 100m skyscraper on the adjoining site, which he had acquired through his takeover of Dunloe Ewart. However, work on the project stalled, and Dublin city council refused a time extension for the tower development.  Several other elements of Carroll\\'s empire, including Zoe, are in receivership following moves by other banks. In an interview last week, David Hughes of Ernst & Young, who acts as receiver to Zoe Group for Bank of Scotland (Ireland), said Carroll\\'s properties produced \"a very substantial amount of income\" and there was \"merit\" in keeping them together.  Hughes sold two former Carroll properties, Gasworks House and Gordon House, to Google for ?100m last year.  \\'\\' THE PROPERTIES PRODUCE VERY SUBSTANTIAL INCOME',\n",
       " 'Ownership in 401(k) Plans Continues to Grow According to a report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), at the same time 401(k) plan ownership is rising, ownership of individual retirement accounts (IRAs) is sliding.  In an analysis of the period 2007 to 2010, EBRI found that the share of American families with a member in any employment-based retirement plan from a current employer increased steadily, from 39% in 1992, to 41% in 2007, before declining to 38% in 2010.  Ownership of 401(k)-type plans among families participating in a retirement plan more than doubled, from 32% in 1992, to 79.5% in 2007, and increased again in 2010, to 82%. But the percentage of families owning an IRA or Keogh retirement plan (for the self-employed) declined, from 31% in 2007, to 28% in 2010. In addition, the percentage of families with a retirement plan from a current employer, a previous employer\\'s defined contribution (DC) plan, or an IRA/Keogh declined, from 66% in 2007, to 64% in 2010.  As in the past, EBRI found that retirement plan assets account for a growing percentage of most Americans\\' financial wealth, not counting the value of their home. The median percentage of families\\' total financial assets comprised by DC plan assets and/or IRA/Keogh assets (assuming the family had any) increased from 2007 to 2010, and accounted for a clear majority of these assets:  DC plan balances accounted for 58% of families\\' total financial assets in 2007, and that share grew to 61% in 2010.  DC and/or IRA/Keogh balances increased their share as well, from 64% of total family financial assets in 2007, to 66% in 2010. Across all demographic groups, these assets account for a very large share of total financial assets for those who own these accounts.  However, the EBRI report notes that the most recent data, along with other EBRI research, indicates that few people are likely to afford a comfortable retirement.  \"Americans lost a tremendous amount of wealth between 2007 and 2010, and the percentage of families that participated in an employment-based retirement plan and/or owned an IRA decreased as well,\" said Craig Copeland, EBRI senior research associate and author of the report.  However, he added, the percentage of family heads eligible to participate in a DC plan and actually did so remained virtually unchanged during this time. Therefore, despite all the bad news that resulted from this period, one positive factor should be noted, Copeland said. \"Those eligible to participate in a retirement plan continued to participate-which may help change the likelihood of a lower retirement standard for many Americans,\" he said.  The report is based on the most recent data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), the Federal Reserve Board\\'s triennial survey of wealth. The full report is published in the September EBRI Issue Brief, \"Individual Account Retirement Plans: An Analysis of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances,\" available online at www.ebri.org.',\n",
       " 'Personal Finance For retirees, 70 may not be the new 65 It\\'s become common-and comforting-wisdom: Those who haven\\'t saved enough for retirement can significantly boost their income in their golden years by working until the age of 70, instead of the traditional 65.  Not so, counters a study released Thursday by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. \"You\\'re not going to magically be fine if you work a few more years,\" said Jack VanDerhei, research director for EBRI and author of the report.  EBRI\\'s studies often sound a sobering note on this topic (See our MarketWatch colleague Robert Powell\\'s take on a study from last year: \"Many of Us Won\\'t Be Able to Retire Until Our 80s\").  Its latest study is noticeably less optimistic than a recent report by another influential research group, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The center\\'s report had found that 86% of households would be prepared to retire by age 70. That report also found a relatively small gap between the retirement readiness of low-income and high-income households. But EBRI\\'s report concluded that about a third of today\\'s households wouldn\\'t be financially ready even if they worked to age 70.  VanDerhei said that the Center for Retirement Research analysis didn\\'t factor in the prohibitively high costs of nursing home care, which typically isn\\'t fully covered by Medicare and is only covered by Medicaid in some cases. His own methodology included the probability of nursing home expenses and arrived at a less optimistic conclusion.  It also projected a much bigger gap between rich and poor: While 90% of those making at least $72,500 in annual income would have a 50% chance of meeting their retirement income needs by age 65, those making $11,700 and below would need to work until 84 to have the same probability of success.  Neither study specifically defines the percentage of working income that a retiree would need to replace to be considered adequately prepared. (In an email, Andrew D. Eschtruth, communications director for the Center for Retirement Research, says, \"Different methodologies will produce different results, but both studies agree that working longer will help improve retirement security.\")  Many workers don\\'t even have the luxury of delaying retirement. In EBRI\\'s 2012 Retirement Confidence Survey, 50% of current retirees reported they left the workforce earlier than planned-because of health concerns for themselves or their spouse, changes at their company or other reasons. The bottom line for workers? \"Bite the bullet and save the additional money,\" VanDerhei said.  EBRI\\'s findings weren\\'t all bleak, however: The study found that workers who participated in a 401(k) plan at age 65 boosted their retirement readiness by 20 percentage points.  If you haven\\'t saved enough for retirement, working a few more years won\\'t magically improve your security. But workers who participate in a 401(k) plan boost their retirement readiness substantially.|103',\n",

       " \"Real Estate Buyers still in the box seat THE signs may be pointing to gloom, but for homebuyers there may not be a better time to strike.  The Commonwealth Bank Home Buyers Index, compiled with RP Data, shows there are five regions of Melbourne considered buyers' markets compared with one that is a sellers' market. The index is based on the ratio of properties available for sale compared with demand for Commonwealth Bank home loans, to identify hot spots for buyers and sellers across Australia.  Eastern middle Melbourne, Greater Dandenong, inner Melbourne, Boroondara and Mornington Peninsula are buyer hot spots, while northern outer Melbourne is best for sellers.  RP Data research director Tim Lawless said the fourth index had seen subtle improvements, ``however the housing market still favours the buyer''.  ``Our data is showing stock levels remain high across each of the capital cities, so prospective buyers have a good range of housing options to choose from,'' Mr Lawless said.  CALL TO USE SUPER CASH FOR HOUSE DEPOSIT  A LEADING mortgage broker has called on the Federal Government to change the rules governing compulsory superannuation so Australians can use their super for a first-home deposit.  1300HomeLoan managing director John Kolenda said rules could be modelled on the successful Singaporean system which has lifted home ownership there to 90 per cent of people compared with 66 per cent in Australia.  ``At the moment we are making it harder than it needs to be for first-home buyers to get a roof over their heads because we are forcing them to save 9 per cent of their income for super before they can even start saving money for a home deposit,'' Mr Kolenda said.  ``It is ridiculous to make someone who is just starting out in life save for their retirement before they have even secured a home, especially when you consider that owning your own home is one of the greatest protections against poverty in old age anyway.''  RECONFIGURATION ADDS MORE APARTMENTS  STRONG buyer demand has prompted the developers of Local Carlton to reconfigure its project to add five three-bedroom apartments and 12 one-bedroom apartments.  Developer Living Carlton Consortium, a joint venture between Australand Property Group and Citta Property Group, is setting its sights on young families wanting an affordable three-bedroom living option in the heart of the inner-city.  ``Our three-bedroom apartments offer an affordable alternative for those buyers being priced out of the Carlton house market,'' said Australand's Sarah Bloom.  ``Local Carlton is also attracting interest from young families who currently live in the suburbs and want to cut down their commute time.''  The development's three-bedroom apartments are priced from $645,000.  ``Apart from penthouses, which typically sell for more than $800,000, most residential apartment developments offer less than 4 per cent of their total configurations as three bedrooms,'' Ms Bloom said.  ``Our move to incorporate more options into our apartment mix has already proven very popular with young families.''\",\n",
       " 'Money Speed trading threatens Terminator event The buying and selling of shares by computers has frightening implications, writes David Potts.  \\'Dark pools\" sounds like something particles whizzing around the Hadron Collider at almost the speed of light might find.  If only. Fact is they are a by-product of something more sinister: speed trading, where computers initiate, uh interface, share trades with each other so fast that if you blink you\\'ve missed 150 of them.  If it\\'s possible to travel faster than the speed of light, these computers will be the first to know.  Not that they\\'ll tell anybody. The problem with speed trading is nobody, least of all the ASX or Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), knows what the computers are up to.  There\\'s no human intervention, apart from the design of the algorithms in the first place. From there, the computers are on their own and can run rampant with a faulty algorithm until somebody pulls the plug, invariably too late.  Remember the \"flash crash\" two years ago, when Wall Street dropped 1000 points in 20 minutes? Speed trading. Even scarier, it\\'s spread to commodities and, gulp, derivatives, bringing wild price fluctuations with it.  A Wall Street trader, Knight Capital Group, recently blew $440 million in an hour as its computer went haywire - distorting the prices of 150 stocks in the process - and nearly went under.  And what if it had? Good riddance you say - only that could have been another Lehman moment. It was the collapse of the non-collapsible Lehman Brothers that pushed the global financial system to the brink.  Yet speed trading is encouraged by the ASX, which happens to earn a fee for every quote, so a few more million sure won\\'t hurt it.  Trouble is, the computers are trading with each other for starters.  Besides, the computer programs vault to the top of the queue because they know your order before the ASX\\'s computer does and, the way things are going, I dare say even you. They\\'ll undercut a seller and overbid a buyer to get in first. Cripes, they can beat you even at the same price.  Or they\\'re flooding the market with fake bids, suggesting something\\'s happening and there\\'s momentum, only to cancel them a nanosecond before the market opens. That\\'s called manipulation and would land a broker who tried it in jail.  This is pushing more trades off the exchange into dark pools owned by banks and brokers, which has the ASX whingeing to ASIC.  Still, it says dark pools are the antithesis of what a sharemarket should be about - transparency and a level playing field. While ASIC and ASX are sending papers to each other on how to control dark pools, the cause of them - speed trading - is accelerating, so to speak.  What scares me is that they\\'ve already lost control and don\\'t even realise it.  Follow David on Twitter @moneypotts',\n",
       " 'Business Expectations unrealistic about retirement Young Canadians have unrealistic expectations about retirement, a new report suggests.  Younger people are the least likely to put money away for retirement, according to a Bank of Montreal survey, \"because in all probability, their retirement date is the furthest away.\" Despite this, they have \"overly optimistic\" goals of retiring early.  Almost half (41%) of Canadians between 18 and 35 plan to retire before they turn 60, while 57% say they\\'ll stop working between 60 and 69. Boomers over 55, however, don\\'t have such lofty expectations: Only 8% expect to call it quits by 60.  \"The fact that younger adults are the least prepared ... should not be overlooked. Logically speaking, the earlier individuals start to save for retirement, the greater the potential for ensuring future financial security,\" the BMO report said.  They key to tackling this problem is to change young people\\'s attitudes about retirement, BMO suggests. While 82% of adults under 35 agreed that retirement planning is important, and 52% have some savings in an RRSP, very few actually think about retirement in detail.  Just 10% said they thought a lot about how much money they need to save. Fewer than 5% had thought about how long their retirement might last.  \"In the absence of visualizing one\\'s retirement, it is impossible to accurately forecast the amount of money that might be required, and for how long. Not knowing these details may be an indication that a person does not have a strong attitude towards retirement,\" the study\\'s authors noted.  \"Judging by the low financial preparedness scores found by the research, their future prosperity may be currently at risk. It is important to help this younger generation -- and soon -- as it is clear that the earlier they start to save for retirement, the more financial security they are likely to have in the long run.\"  The results are based on a sample of 1,000 Canadians polled in February by Leger Marketing.

       " 'Financial Services Authority acts to prevent banks misselling packaged current accounts; The FSA has issued new rules to ensure that customers are not missold a packaged bank account. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is clamping down on how packaged bank accountsare sold to prevent customers from \"throwing money down the drain\".  Packaged accounts, where customers pay a monthly fee for their account in return for freebies and perks, are big money spinners for banks. Extras thrown in alongside a current account typically include travel insurance, breakdown cover, mobile phone insurance and discounts on overdraft fees.  But fees for such perks can cost up to £300 year and the FSA is concerned that many of the extras offered are unsuitable for customers.  The regulator has now published new rules that will force banks and building societies to check whether customers are eligible to claim on insurance cover before selling them a packaged bank account and alert them if some are not.  Sheila Nicoll, FSA director of policy, said: \"These products are often referred to as upgraded accounts but if you end up paying for an element you can\\'t claim on, it\\'s money down the drain. We are closely monitoring the promotion of packaged bank accounts and the new rules will make sure customers know what they\\'re buying and that they can rely on the product or have the limitations explained before buying.\"  The number of people holding packaged bank accounts has doubled over the past five years. According to figures from data analysts, Defaqto, there are currently 70 different types of packaged accounts on sale in the UK, compared with 39 in 2007.  The Financial Ombudsman Service said it receives about 150 complaints each year linked to the accounts but it added that the overall number is likely to be \"significantly\" higher as most complaints are linked to insurance policies sold as part of the account. Many customers have found they are ineligible to claim on parts of the packages such as travel insurance.  Of Britain\\'s largest banks, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group refused to say how many of its customers use paid-for accounts.  The largely state owned Royal Bank of Scotland said 2.5 million customers held packaged accounts, while HSBC said 840,000 of its customers held such accounts. Elsewhere, the Co-operative Bank said it now had 210,00 customers using packaged accounts, while Santander UK said that it had 300,000 customers on paid-for accounts.  All banks said they were taking steps to ensure suitable customers took out packaged accounts and had co-operated with the FSA investigation.  Michael Ossei, personal finance expert at uSwitch.com, said: \"This is good news for consumers as it brings some much-needed clarity into the paid-for current account market. For too long, banks have been signing up customers to these fee-paying accounts with little evidence to suggest that the customer actually requires or can even use the benefits that they are paying for.\"',\n",
       " \"Divorce hits female finances: study Divorce hits female finances: study  By Rachel Wells  Women's household incomes suffer more than men after divorce, but it takes men longer to recover emotionally, a new study has found. The joint research, led by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, also highlights the significant impact divorce has on the financial assets of divorcees, which leads to many requiring greater government support in later life. The research - to be presented at the AIFS conference in Melbourne  later this week - shows the household income after divorce declined for women, but not for men. In fact, while women's household income dropped significantly, particularly in the first year after divorce, males' income continued to rise. While the research showed some women were able to return to their pre-divorce income after six years, through re-partnering, increased labour force participation and government benefits, this was not the case for divorced women with dependent children.  The report - based on data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study - also showed that divorced men and women have fewer household assets than their married and never married counterparts. While the assets of those who divorce are $180,000 to $190,000 less than non-divorced people, even before divorce, the gap doubles to $360,000 to $390,000, six years after divorce. AIFS senior research fellow Lixia Qu said for divorcees who did not re-partner, a lack of assets could  lead to a greater reliance on government benefits. ''Divorce has a big impact on both men and women whose assets continue to fall behind married households and this impacts significantly on retirement income for divorced men and women who remained single, making them more reliant on government support to get by,'' she said. Melbourne mother-of-two, Isabella Mammoliti, who was forced to return to work after her divorce in 2007, says it is not just the immediate  financial burden of being a single parent that causes her ''distress'', but the long-term financial impact. ''My biggest worry is that I hadn't worked for over seven years and that's going to affect my superannuation in the future ... I've also had to sell the family home which has not only had an emotional impact on the children but will have a long-term financial impact.'' The study - which also looked at the emotional wellbeing of divorcees - revealed that men reported greater feelings of isolation and loneliness  than women, even up to six years after divorce. After two years of divorce, 24 per cent of men said they felt isolated, compared to 12 per cent of women. After six years, more men (19 per cent) than women (12 per cent) still reported feelings of isolation. Meanwhile, 35 per cent of men reported feeling ''very lonely'' two years after divorce, compared to 25 per cent of women. and after six years, 26 per cent of men still reported loneliness compared with 20 per cent of women.  18776785\",\n",
       " 'Business Day Report Details Woes of Student Loan Debt As in the housing market, securitization of student loans led to more aggressive underwriting for borrowers who could not possibly afford the debt they took on, according to a government report.  The 131-page report was formally released by the Education Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday. It provides new estimates for total outstanding student loan debt: more than $1 trillion in 2011, composed of $864 billion in federal government loans and $150 billion in private student loan debt.  Cumulative defaults on private student loans exceeded $8 billion, a sum from over 850,000 distinct loans.  That total has risen in the last decade as lenders bypassed college financial aid offices and marketed loans directly to students. Students often signed on without realizing the difference between private and government loans or that government loans usually offered better terms, the report says.  Private student loans, for example, usually charge higher interest rates and are harder to discharge in bankruptcy.  In addition, many lenders lowered their underwriting standards so that they could originate and then sell off more loans, even if the loans were based on terms the borrowers could not possibly fulfill. Defaults became even more inevitable after the recession slashed graduates\\' job possibilities.  \"Subprime-style lending went to college and now students are paying the price,\" the education secretary, Arne Duncan, said. \"We still have some work to do to ensure that students who take out private student loans have the same kinds of protections offered by federal loans. In the meantime, if you have to take out a loan to pay for college, federal student aid should be your first option.\"  In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Mr. Duncan and Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, described ways in which private lenders might have misled borrowers or failed to be entirely transparent about their borrowing terms.  The government officials said they are not currently pursuing action against lenders for these past lending practices, but are monitoring the market now under authority granted by the Dodd-Frank financial regulation legislation. They have also urged Congress to reconsider the treatment of private loans in bankruptcies and to require more disclosure in the loan application process.  Private lenders have already tightened their credit standards after the torrent of defaults in several ways, like requiring student loans to be co-signed. In 2008, 67 percent of private student loans were co-signed; as of 2011, more than 90 percent were.  Mr. Duncan also offered a checklist of tasks that students should complete to make more conscientious decisions about financing college.  These include applying to more than one school and filling out a financial aid form for each school. The vast majority of students who fill out federal student financial aid forms do so for only one school, he said, and so do not have an opportunity to compare the value they could get from different schools.',\n",
       " \"Screens Invest Why Investors Should Skip Top Dividend-Yielders; Hough: Investors should be careful about reaching too high for yield. Income investing used to be easy. A retiree who plunked $1 million into 10-year Treasury notes during the past half century locked in, on average, a yearly income of around $67,000. But with interest rates at record lows, that same investment recently paid less than $15,000 a year.  Some investors are looking to stocks with high dividend yields to recoup this lost income. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index yields 2.2 percent, but its top 50 stocks, by dividend, yield an average of 5.5 percent. That's enough to turn that $1 million into $55,000 in yearly income.  Be careful about reaching too high for yield, however. Income investors are better off skipping those top 50 high-yielders and looking instead to the 50 that are just below them, whose yields average 3.8 percent.  Here are three reasons: First, high-yielders were stars last year but have been slipping of late. The S&P's top 50 yielders returned a whopping 18.5 percent in 2011, beating the 2.1 percent total return for the broad index as well as the total returns for more than 30 stock-picking strategies tracked by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. But so far this year, high-yielders have performed near the bottom of the pack.  Second, because dividend yields rise as share prices fall, the highest yields are often attached to troubled firms. Investors who give up a little yield can get a lot more safety -- and they may not even have to settle for lower total returns. For example, among the top 50 S&P members by dividend yield, the median paid more than 80 percent of its earnings as dividends over the past year, compared with 53 percent in the next 50. The higher that number, the greater the risk of a dividend cut if earnings dip. Also, the top 50 yielders' dividends grew by a median rate of just 2 percent during the past year, compared with 10 percent for the 50 below them. Dividend growth can lead to higher share prices, which boost total returns. According to Bank of America, both groups have generated handsome average returns of more than 16 percent in rolling 12-month periods since 1984 -- but the top group has lost money more often.  The third reason: The dividend tax is capped at 15 percent; but the cap expires at the end of this year, and without action from Congress, the rate for high-income investors could more than double. That could lead to a short-term sell-off in high-yield stocks.  The stocks below come from the S&P 500's second-highest-yielding group of 50. Each firm has manageable debt and affordable dividends, and each recently boosted its payment -- as good a sign as any that management sees healthy profits ahead.\",\n",
       " 'WSJ: U.S. Chief Justice Roberts Surprises With Ruling on Health-Care Law The pivotal--and most surprising--vote to uphold most of the Obama administration\\'s health-care law came from Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts, in a move that is likely to be celebrated by the political left and derided by those on the right.  The chief justice was expected by many legal experts to vote alongside the conservative bloc and shoot down the law but instead he cast a crucial fifth vote with the liberal side.  Legal experts described the unexpected move as much more than a vote about the health-care law. Rather, some saw it as a carefully calibrated move designed to shore up the court\\'s popular reputation in an election year and to provide a potential road map for conservatives looking to challenge other federal laws in court.  \"It was a brilliant stroke,\" said Brad Joondeph, a constitutional law professor at Santa Clara University. By upholding the law, the Chief Justice steered the court \"clear of appearing partisan.\"  But Chief Justice Roberts also made sure to keep the broader impact of his decision narrow, by saying explicitly that the Affordable Care Act survived only if viewed as a tax and that, had Congress had to rely on the Commerce Clause to pass the law, the law would have failed.  \"Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product,\" wrote Chief Justice Roberts. \"If the power to \\'regulate\\' something included the power to create it, many of the provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous.\"  Legal experts suspect that this language could be seized upon in the future by conservatives or others looking to strike down existing--and in some instances longstanding--federal laws regulating everything from the environment to consumer safety. Many of those laws were passed under the Commerce Clause.  \"Make no mistake, Roberts gave the conservatives a very big gift--a ticking time bomb that could explode in cases down the line,\" said Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, a liberal-leaning civil-rights organization in Washington. \"The Commerce Clause undergirds the entire fabric of government and a lot of our laws.\"  Since Barack Obama became president, his political fate has been shaped to an unusual degree by decisions made by a court led by Chief Justice Roberts.  One of the first bills signed by the president overturned a pay-discrimination case decided by the Roberts court.  For more than a year, the president and his top aides have said his re-election chances have been undermined by a 2010 decision from the Roberts court that loosened campaign-finance laws and sparked a surge of independent political fundraising, much of it on the right.

       " 'Insurance clarified for departing UTB faculty June 15--Because faculty members who opt to separate from UTB next May will receive nine-month contracts for the coming academic year, their health insurance coverage also will end in May, officials confirmed this week.  As required by federal law, such faculty may continue coverage for a time, at their own expense, through the COBRA program.  The University of Texas at Brownsville is proceeding with a reduction in force because of the end of its partnership with Texas Southmost College.  For faculty who leave UTB and end up joining TSC in the fall of 2013, it would leave a three-month gap in health insurance that they would have to pay for themselves.  Faculty who choose to participate in the \"separation\" program -- which offers a $15,000 payment for the voluntary resignation of tenured faculty -- are expected to deliver their signed agreement to the provost\\'s office in July.  At last count from UTB officials, 88 faculty positions will be terminated next May 31. This August, final notices are expected to be sent to faculty members who are affected.  On Thursday, UTB transition official Michael Putegnat confirmed that the end of faculty health insurance at that time is a cost-saving measure.  \"For those faculty members who will be separating at the end of May in 2013, they will be paid their full year\\'s salary in nine monthly payments, the last of which will be for May,\" he said. \"They will have no summer payments from which to deduct their health insurance premiums, nor will they be employees, so their employer will not be paying the premium either.\"  COBRA provides for continuing coverage.  \"UTB cannot afford to pay the full insurance premium for the separating employees over the summer, but those leaving do qualify for COBRA, which allows them to continue their insurance for a time if they choose to and make the premium payments,\" Putegnat said.  UTB provided the following information regarding monthly rates for the UT Select Medical and prescription plan for fiscal year 2012:  Employee only: $468.39  Employee and spouse: $918.56  Employee and children: $838.35  Employee and family: $1,274.95  In related separation matters, Putegnat confirmed UTB will retain eight faculty members who were formerly master technical instructors, a unique position created for the UTB-TSC partnership. He said they will teach in the following areas: accounting and management information systems, allied health, behavior sciences, biological sciences, computer and information sciences, and English.  Master technical instructors were teachers without terminal degrees, meaning they may not have the highest degree offered in their field or their field may not have an advanced degree.

The section provides that any person who \"knowingly and in violation of this part...obtains individually identifiable health information relating to an individual\" is subject to a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $50,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than one year.  Zhou was charged under subsection (a)(2) of the Wrongful Disclosure Section for \"knowingly\" accessing patients\\' medical records with no permitted justification after he was terminated from UHS for performance-related reasons. According to a 2010 statement, Zhou illegally accessed patient records 323 times during a three-week period, including those of his immediate supervisor, co-workers, and well-known celebrities. Zhou admitted in his plea agreement to accessing patient records on four specific occasions after his termination. Zhou was the first individual convicted of, and incarcerated for, misdemeanor HIPAA offenses for accessing confidential patient records without a valid reason or authorization.  On appeal, Zhou argued that a defendant cannot be guilty of violating HIPAA if he did not know that obtaining the protected health information was illegal. The court rejected his argument, finding that it \"contradicts the plain language of HIPAA.\" The court held that the word \"and\" clearly provides that there are two elements of a Wrongful Disclosure Section violation: 1) knowingly obtaining individually identifiable health information relating to an individual; and 2) obtaining that information in violation of HIPAA.  The court stated that \"the term \\'knowingly\\' applies only to the act of obtaining the health information\" and that the defendant need only know that he obtained individually identifiable health information relating to an individual in order to be found guilty of violating the statute.  Every provider must develop and implement policies designed to ensure that terminated employees cannot access the provider\\'s systems, including those with protected health information. Referencing this case in the course of employee training will further drive the point home and reinforce the importance of preventing the unauthorized access of protected health information.

       " 'Manchin: We Must Come Together To Keep Student Loans Affordable - Sen. Joe, III Manchin (D-WV) News Release Office of Sen. Joe, III Manchin (D-WV) News Release  Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) issued the following statement about votes today on keeping student loan rates affordable.  \"The fact is that keeping student loan rates low should be one of the highest priorities for this country, because we must invest in the next generation,\" Senator Manchin said. \"As Democrats and Republicans, we must come together and agree on a way to keep student loans affordable.  \"For the people of West Virginia, it\\'s only fair to fund these student loans by ending loopholes in our tax system - like the John Edwards/Newt Gingrich loophole that allows some to avoid paying their Medicare taxes. Unfortunately, a second measure would have taken the wrong approach, by eliminating funding for preventive health care, which is so important to our communities in West Virginia.  \"Affordable student loan rates should not be a partisan issue, and I am determined to make sure that the federal government will be a good partner for the young people of this country who are taking out loans to invest in their education.\"  Background:  According to the Project on Student Debt, West Virginia\\'s students have an average of $23,678 in student debt.  About 73 percent of students in West Virginia have student loan debt.  According to the Department of Education, more than 60 percent of college students get a federal student loan at some point in their undergraduate studies. Subsidized Stafford loans will account for more than one-quarter of the total federal student loan volume next year.  Senator Manchin supported S. 2343, the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act of 2012, which would extend the current 3.4% interest rate on federally subsidized Stafford student loans for one year. The cost of the bill is offset by requiring those with incomes over $250,000 to include, for purposes of employment taxes, income received from an S-corp.  Senator Manchin voted against S. 2366, the Interest Rate Reduction Act, which also extends the current 3.4% interest rate for one year. The cost of the bill is offset by repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides grant assistance to states and other entities for prevention, wellness, and other public health-related programs. West Virginia has been awarded $9.9 million in Prevention Fund grants.  Subsidized Stafford student loans are awarded based on financial need. The federal government pays the interest on Subsidized loans while the student is in school, during the grace period, and during authorized deferment. About 70 percent of students who qualify for subsidized loans have a family income of less than $50,000. The Department of Education estimates that about 30 percent of undergraduates have this type of loan.

       " 'BP\\'s cash balance plan offers flexibility, value In 1989, BP America Inc. converted its existing final average pay pension plan to a cash balance plan, becoming one of the first major employers to adopt what was then a still relatively new plan design.  More than 20 years after BP made the switch, the appeal of the plan remains powerful, says Rick Dorazil, BP\\'s vp-total reward, Western Hemisphere.  \"One doesn\\'t have to wait until the end of his or her career to build a significant balance, as is the case with a final average pay plan. Cash balance plans provide a more even accrual of benefits,\" Mr. Dorazil said.  That steadier buildup of benefits means employees can earn a significant benefit after just a few years of service, Mr. Dorazil said, an advantage as the workforce becomes more mobile.  And since the benefit is expressed as a lump sum, it is highly visible and thus appreciated by plan participants, he said. \"I can see my vested balance. I know what I am going to walk away with,\" Mr. Dorazil said.  Many other employers, though, have frozen defined benefit plans, including cash balance plans. Indeed, a Towers Watson & Co. analysis published last year found that 40% of Fortune 1000 companies with defined benefit plans had frozen at least one of those plans, up from just over 7% as recently as 2004.  But BP is sticking with its cash balance plan for several reasons. Pragmatically, BP\\'s major competitors still offer pension plans. But just as important, BP\\'s pension plan is highly valued by both new and veteran employees, Mr. Dorazil said.  And the time may come when employers may be at a competitive disadvantage if they do not offer a pension plan, he said.  \"The under-age-35 population is starting to connect the dots. They understand that with a 401(k) plan, all the investment risk is on them,\" he said. And that younger generation saw the consequences of that risk during the economic downturn that began in 2008, when the value of many employees\\' 401(k) account balances plunged along with the stock market, he said.  \"They (younger employees) saw what happened to their parents,\" Mr. Dorazil said.  Unlike many other employers, BP\\'s cash balance plan is fully funded, Mr. Dorazil said. Recently, the company moved to an investment strategy in which more plan assets are invested in bonds and other fixed income investments, and less in equities.  That shift has reduced investment volatility, with the maturity of fixed income investments linked to meeting the plan\\'s cash needs to pay benefits.  Under the plan, employees receive pay-related credits. In addition, they also receive interest credits. Interest on employees\\' account balances is tied to the interest rate on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, with a minimum annual 5% interest credit.  \"If managed correctly, a cash balance plan will provide tremendous value to employees, while providing funding flexibility for the company,\" Mr. Dorazil said.',\n",

       " \"News Double whammy The European sword of Damocles in the guise of Solvency II and gender- neutral annuity pricing has been hanging over the annuity market for some time and will come to a head at the end of 2012.  Solvency II is a complex piece of EU regulation that will result in life companies setting aside more capital to support their future liabilities. If annuity companies have to put more capital aside to finance their annuities,it will inevitably result in lower incomes. This is one of the reasons why Prudential is considering moving its HQ overseas.  However, there was some good news from Europe recently when a very technical announcement has been interpreted as meaning that the nightmare of a 10 to 20 per cent cut in rates now appears unlikely. Solvency II may have a negative effect on annuity rates but not as bad as many expected.  Gender-neutral annuity pricing means exactly that. The rates for men and women will be the same despite the obvious difference in life expectancy. It is hard to see who will benefit except for single ladies as married ladies will lose out from the lower income from joint life annuities.  With annuity rates at such low levels, some commentators think we are approaching the time when guarantee annuity rates can no longer be thought of as the default option at retirement for those with above average funds.  I think this is a very interesting point and I do think we have reached that stage already.  To be clear, those with below- average sized pension funds and who have no other sources of income or capital will probably find that guaranteed annuities are the right investment for them. From an advice point of view, these clients should not take undue risk with their pension funds. Also, inflation may not be a big issue as the state pension makes up a significant part of their pension and this will increase each year.  However, for those with above average pension funds, the alternatives such as investment-linked annuities, fixed income plans and drawdown will be viable alternatives to guaranteed annuities.  I have recently been looking at the benefits of advice for customers and one of the themes is that advice should be future-proof. By that I mean a client should be satisfied that their income needs will be met. So if both inflation and interest rates rose significantly in the future, their annuity income should be protected from inflation while also benefiting from any increase in interest rates. A guaranteed annuity clearly does not do this.  In conclusion, annuity rates have reached the bottom of the current cycle and we may see some very small increases until the double whammy of Solvency II and gender-neutral pricing kick in at the end of the year. I also see an increase in demand for advice as individual circumstances become more complex. 'We may see some very small increases until Solvency II and gender-neutral pricing kick in\",\n",
       " \"BUSINESS What's fair share when it's your nest egg? THE old shares versus cash debate has risen again and, as with anything to do with money, especially our superannuation hip pockets, it's an emotional issue.  Four years after the global financial crisis, many people are still feeling burnt by the share market. Most Australian super funds have not recovered all their losses and many never will.  Even when they do get back to ``ground zero'' and their balances and contributions are back up to full whack, many will still have lost years of investment growth that we would otherwise have earned during the recovery period.  No wonder shares versus cash is a touchy subject.  But the heart of the debate is quite simple: compared with most of the developed world, Australian superannuation funds have a larger amount of money riding on the share market.  About 50 per cent of our super money -- $650 billion -- is at the mercy of the roller-coaster share market every day. A 1 per cent fall, means $6.5 billion instantly wiped off.  But, of course, a 1 per cent increase means an extra $6.5 billion in the nest egg -- and that's the lure of the share market.  So, what does it mean when some people say we have too much money in the share market compared with other countries -- 40 per cent in Canada and about 30 per cent in Japan.  Is it a deliberate strategy by Australian trustees and fund managers, or is it lazy or convenient that we have a higher percentage in shares?  Where should the money be invested? Is the Australian corporate and government bond market safe and liquid enough?  And how much is too much, anyway?  While, yes, compared with other countries, Aussie super funds are overweight in shares but as a nation we are also heavily overweight in residential property.  We are big-time property owners, while the rest of the world are big-time property renters. Should we scale back our home ownership?  Regardless of which side of the fence you stand on, the answer is not the most important part of the debate. What matters is that it gets us all thinking about our own super and how we want it invested.  It's fine for the boffins and academics to debate the theory of shares versus bonds, but what's right for a 30-year-old single is not going to be the same as a 40-year-old family man or a 70-year-old widow.  Superannuation is not a one-size-fits-all option.  We must take responsibility and make our own decisions about where to invest our money.  After all, you wouldn't hand over $100,000 to a real estate agent and say put it on deposit for any property, anywhere. So why would you hand over $100,000 to a fund manager and say do anything you want with it?  Have your say: heraldsun.com.au/business\",\n",
       " \"Features Cowie's blog week Millions of public sector pensioners lose fight to escapean equity of misery  Tuesday, Narch 20: Posted by Ian Cowie  Comment on this at telegraph.co.uk/blogs  Public sector pensioners are entitled to resent a ruling by the Court of Appeal on indexlinking because it will almost certainly reduce the real value or purchasing power of their pensions in retirement.  The Government is undoubtedly guilty of doubledealing in the different ways it measures inflation. It uses the higher retail prices index (RPI) to determine rail fare increases and how much interest graduates must pay on their debts. Then it switches to the lower consumer prices index (CPI) to calculate how much compensation state pensioners and other people living on fixed incomes require for the way quantitative easing and negative real interest rates are shrinking the pounds in their pockets.  Indexation was originally intended to preserve the real value of pensions against insidious erosion by inflation. While many utilities and basic foods are seeing double-digit price increases, it is difficult to see how CPI will achieve that aim. If it continues to fall short of the real cost of living, perhaps it will come to be known as the cutting pensions index.  But it will narrow the gap between private sector and public sector retirement provision; 95pc of savers in the private sector with defined contribution pensions cannot afford any form of inflation protection at all.  So today's decision goes some way to imposing an equality of misery on private and public sector pensioners. But the latter still have a good deal for which to be grateful: pensions that most of their counterparts outside the government payroll could never afford.  You said  I am sick of people berating the pensions of nurses/teachers etc.  All of us should have decent pensions but oh no ? let's berate the public sector so we all get NO pensions.  bella 21/03/2012 at 12.09  This effect is a consequence of too much government spending, for any and all reasons, and the natural increase in inflation.  ryck 21/03/2012 at 06.07  The fact that inflation on some items of expenditure is higher than CPI is neither here nor there. Life goes round and one must take the rough with the smooth (that includes me). When the country is broke, we have to accept some reduction in our generally reasonable lifestyle.  davidofkent 20/03/2012 at 03:24  Sounds like a very just judgment, one that will help those who have to work hard to pay for the pensions of others, though it would be far better for the UK economy if a cut in those pensions, which come on top of the state pension, were engineered.  nettle 20/03/2012 at 01.49  Roll on the next election when we pensioners will be voting ?

       " 'Financial Post U.S. to turn into major oil-products exporter: report; Huge impact on Canada Changes are afoot in the global energy sector with the United States set to reprise its role as a major producer and exporter of fossil fuels. But these changes would have a profound impact on its energy trade with Canada, especially in the natural-gas sector, according to a report released Tuesday.  From a perpetually hungry energy consumer, the U.S. will turn into a major exporter of coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil products within the next 20 years, the report says.  \"Between reduced oil imports, and the rise of China, the U.S. is starting to assume a more sophisticated role - a role where the U.S. could export over 500 million tonnes of coal, 3.2 billion cubic feet per day of LNG and possibly over 2.5 million barrels per day of oil products by 2030,\" said Wood Mackenzie, an energy research consultancy, in a study.  The U.S. is set to become a net LNG exporter by 2016 with piped gas exports to Mexico reaching 1.8 bcfd. To put that into perspective, the last time the U.S. was a net exporter of gas was in 1957.  U.S. net oil imports will be 3.3 mil-lion b/d less than in 2010 on the back of greater vehicle fuel efficiencies and changing consumer habits.  \"The position of the U.S. as a net exporter of oil products has arisen during a time in which demand has dropped by almost 1.9 million bpd from its peak in 2005, with 2011 demand being approximately 150,000 below 2010 levels,\" said Alan Gelder, Head of Oil Research for Wood Mackenzie.  Strong supply growth from key tight-oil plays in the U.S., shown by the structural shift in the Brent-WTI differential, is supporting the emergence of the U.S. as a growing net exporter of oil products, according to the consultancy.  However, the U.S. shale-gas boom would decrease U.S. dependence on Canadian gas. Wood Mackenzie expects Canada\\'s net exports to the U.S. to be almost 30% lower in 2030, compared with the peak reached in 2002.  This is partly due to U.S. self-sufficiency in natural gas, but also due to Canada\\'s rising gas needs, which will exceed production.  \"Canadian demand will increase by almost 60% from 2010 to 2030 while production will only increase by 40% over the same time frame,\" the report notes.  Canadian natural-gas demand will be driven by oil sands production, which is forecast to require 2.1 bcfd of additional gas to match its rising oputput by 2030.  \"As the U.S. adjusts to its new role, only one thing is certain. The supply/demand fundamentals of the second-largest energy consumer are changing, and this will have untold consequences on an increasingly global energy market,\" the report concludes.  yhussain@nationalpost.com',\n",

       " 'Professional Probate Instructions Continue to Fall BRISTOL, ENGLAND--(Marketwire - Feb. 6, 2012) - For the last few years, official figures released by the Probate Service have shown that applications made for a Grant of Representation (usually a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration) by solicitors have fallen for the last three years (2008 to 2010). Professional applications fell by 4% in 2010 and by 9% and 10% respectively in 2009 and 2008. Numbers have declined by 30% in total since 2006.  The firm Title Research, which published the Probate Service statistics, suggests a number of reasons for this trend. It can partly be explained by a gradual rise over the years in applications from private individuals, who have decided to administer the deceased\\'s estate themselves rather than using a solicitor, either through personal choice or for reasons of economy. However, private applications actually fell by 1% in 2010.  Other contributing factors could include a more relaxed attitude from banks and buildings societies towards the need for a Grant of Representation, and an increasing number of estates falling below the GBP 5,000 threshold under which Probate is not required. It could also be suggested that a reluctance to pay Inheritance Tax is also causing some people to avoid applying for Probate on an estate they are administering.  A Probate expert at The Co-operative Legal Services, comments: \\'Without a doubt, there are a number of reasons for the decline in professional Probate applications. This certainly isn\\'t solely due to an increase in \"DIY Probate\" over time. Having said that, with today\\'s tough economic climate, it is likely that more people will try and handle Probate and administer estates themselves in the next few years.  \\'If any mistakes are made on the legal, tax and administrative responsibilities involved in Probate, this could prove extremely costly to put right. For example, undervaluing an estate could lead to you having to pay a large fine as well as the extra Inheritance Tax liability. I would recommend all executors of a Will - or next of kin in cases of intestacy - to seek legal advice before applying for the Grant of Representation, and consider appointing a professional to administer the estate on their behalf.\\'  The Co-operative Legal Services\\' Probate experts offer free advice and support on the Probate process, executor duties and related issues such as intestacy.

       " \"Money Mail SAVERS SUFFER AS ECONOMIC GLOOM SLASHES RETURNS THE prospect of a rise in interest rates is slipping further away as dark clouds hang over Britain's economic recovery.  As the economy slows again, the Bank of England is expected to pump in more money, putting a dampener on any hope of a rise in base rate soon. Economists' predictions of when it will climb from its historic 0.5pc low range from 2013 to 2016.  Monthly income-seekers are facing lower rates than those on offer just a few months ago. Back then, there were plenty of fixed-rate deals paying 2.72pc after tax (3.3pc before) for a year. Now, they are few and far between.  The top deal on the High Street comes from Santander at 2.52pc (3.15pc), on a minimum of £25,000, down from 2.76pc (3.45pc) at the end of last year. A 0.3pc cut before tax on this sum translates into a £75 a drop in income each year.  You can earn more if you are willing to tie up your money for two years - at best 3.18pc (3.98pc) with BM Savings, part of Halifax. The best deal in the High Street comes from C&G at 2.99pc (3.74pc).  The advice of economists is not to tie up your money for longer than two years, as inflation and interest rates could be on the way up by then. Andrew Goodwin, economic adviser at consultancy the ITEM Club, says: 'Fixing for a shorter period makes sense. Inflation will start to rise again when interest rates move up.'  Professor Andrew Clare, from Cass Business School, London, says: 'Two-year bonds paying around 4pc before tax are not bad value, but I'd not tie my money up for longer than that.'  Some High-Street providers pay far less. Barclays offers just 1.5pc (1.98pc) over one year, or £13 income after tax on each £10,000 in your account. Lloyds TSB also pays a poor 1.6pc (2pc) and Halifax 1.78pc (2.23pc). These rates are less than you can earn on an easy-access account.  Make sure that when your fixed-rate deal finishes, you move your money - or you can end up earning a pittance. Halifax pays just 0.08pc (0.1pc) or 66p a month after tax on each £10,000 in its maturity account. You can end up with the same rate with other banks, too.  You can earn tax-free income on your cash Isas, although only a few banks and building societies offer monthly income. But Yorkshire BS and its offshoots Chelsea and Barnsley have launched an 18-month deal at 3.15pc tax-free.  Some banks and building societies traditionally pay less interest to savers in tax-free cash Isa accounts than on similar taxable bonds - effectively denying them some of the tax relief they could earn on these plans.  sy.morris@dailymail.co.uk\",\n",
       " 'News; News Tax incentives for retirement plans should be preserved: ICI survey More than eight in 10 households believe the current tax incentives to encourage retirement saving should be preserved, according to new research by the Investment Company Institute. The research is based on data collected in a survey of 3,000 U.S. households at the end of last year.  The ICI study-America\\'s Commitment to Retirement Security: Investor Attitudes and Actions-found that such agreement was consistently high across various demographic and financial characteristics. Households were asked their views on changing the tax incentives for retirement plans and whether saving incentives for retirement should be a national priority.  It found that households overwhelmingly support maintaining the tax incentives for retirement saving. Eighty-five percent of all U.S. households disagreed when asked whether the tax advantages of defined contribution accounts should be eliminated. Eighty-three percent opposed any reduction in workers\\' account contribution limits. Among households owning defined contribution accounts or individual retirement accounts, nearly nine in 10 disagreed with eliminating or reducing the tax incentives.  A vast majority of households agree that preserving the current retirement savings incentives should be a national priority. Eighty-eight percent of households owning defined contribution accounts or IRAs agree with this policy priority, while 76 percent of households without defined contribution accounts or IRAs agree.  \"It is clear that the current tax incentives to encourage Americans to build a nest egg in retirement accounts are effective and command the overwhelming support of the American public,\" said Paul Schott Stevens, ICI president and CEO. \"Our latest household survey shows that a great majority of U.S. households believe, even in an era of necessary federal budget reforms, that preserving these incentives should be a national priority.\"  The 2011 household survey also polled respondents about their views on retirement plan saving and their confidence in 401(k) and other DC plan accounts.  The majority of households that have DC plans found that these plans promote retirement saving. Nine in 10 households with DC accounts agreed that these plans helped them think about the long term and made it easier for them to save. More than 80 percent of DC-owning households said the immediate tax savings from their retirement plans were a big incentive to contribute.  Investors greatly value the ability to choose and control their investments. Nearly all households with DC accounts agreed that it was important to have choice in, and control of, the investment options in their DC plans. Seventy-nine percent said their plan offers a good lineup of investment options.  \"As in prior years, our 2011 survey confirms that Americans, whether they own retirement accounts or not, have a great deal of confidence in the 401(k) system,\" said Sarah Holden, ICI senior director of retirement and investor research. \"Despite the ups and downs of the stock market and other troubling financial and economic news, favorable attitudes and DC plan investors\\' retirement savings patterns are holding steady.\"',\n",
       " \"By the Numbers Invest 'Safe' Stocks Off to Wobbly Start in 2012; Hough: Consumer staples shares have been stars in recent years. Now they look vulnerable. Stock investors are having a mostly happy new year. The S&P 500-stock index returned around 5% through Friday. And yet the slice of the index that represents safety to many investors -- consumer staples -- is down slightly.  Earnings for the sector have likewise failed to impress. It's early in the current reporting season, with results in for just 59 of the 500 index members; 20 of those companies, or 34%, have so far fallen short of Wall Street forecasts -- a higher than usual miss rate. For consumer staples companies, however, four out of six, or 67%, have missed estimates.  Staples are goods like food, beer, cigarettes and diapers that tend to stay in steady demand even when the economy sours. Nervous investors have rushed into shares of companies that sell such goods in recent years, bidding prices higher. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR, an exchange-traded fund, has returned an average of 6.8% a year over the past five years, versus just 0.3% a year for the broader SPDR S&P 500, even though fees on the latter are about half as high.  That has left staples shares priced at a premium. The sector recently traded at 16 times projected 2011 earnings, versus 13 times earnings for the broad 500 index. Fast earnings growth can make such premiums worth paying, but analysts foresee below-average earnings growth for staples companies this year -- 8%, versus 10% for the index.  The economic profiles of some staple goods may have changed. An abundance of small-batch beer has left big brewers fighting volume declines, and spirits and wine have gotten posher, fueling past growth but adding to economic sensitivity today. Tobacco faces smoking bans. Even packaged food makers are caught between higher ingredient prices and a reluctance among shoppers to pay more.  General Mills, which makes Cheerios, and Constellation Brands, which distributes Robert Mondavi wines, each fell short of analyst forecasts earlier this month. Altria, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, reports earnings on Friday.  If staples shares look weak at the moment, technology shares look surprisingly strong. Within the S&P 500, the sector is up 6% this year. It trades at around 13 times earnings. Only two of 12 companies that have reported earnings during the current season have missed forecasts. Last Thursday, Microsoft, IBM and Intel each reported upside surprises.  Together, those three have an average dividend yield 2.5%, just shy of the 2.7% yield for the SPDR staples fund. And although computer chips, software and technology consulting won't hold up like franks and beans in the event of another recession, the tech trio has a balance sheet advantage. Many staples companies use considerable debt to try to enhance returns. IBM owes little and pays minuscule interest rates. Microsoft and Intel sit on large cash surpluses.\",\n",

It\\'s traditional in some countries to pin cash to a bride\\'s gown, while in Australia about one in every two couples getting hitched specify they want money as a gift, wedding expert Anne Mihelakos from truebride.com.au says.  \"It\\'s becoming more and more acceptable,\\'\\' she says.  \"One reason is because more couples are living together and they already have most traditional gifts people buy and they try to avoid getting a second toaster.  \"But it comes a lot more for convenience as well, and guests know the couple are spending a lot on the wedding and honeymoon, so they are quite happy to contribute to a cause.\\'\\'  Couples often fork out tens of thousands on their big day and many are keen to try to escape getting unwanted gifts.  Wishing wells at a reception venue have become popular and are designed to collect gifts of money or vouchers.  But social etiquette expert Anna Musson, of The Good Manners Company, believes asking for money is \"crass\\'\\'.  \"It\\'s just a cash grab,\\'\\' she says. \"If a couple has been living together before getting married and don\\'t need anything, it\\'s a little gauche to ask for anything at all, and even more so to ask for cash. What is the cash going towards?  \"It\\'s not in Australian culture to ask for cash, but if you have a background where that\\'s what the custom is, then knock yourself out.\\'\\'  Musson says when you do purchase a wedding gift, deliver it to the bride\\'s home to avoid them having to hire a mini-van to collect their gifts from the reception venue. If you are giving cash, decide on how much to give.  Sunshine Coast wedding planner Kim Eibrink Jansen has more than 20 years\\' experience planning weddings and says guests are often unsure on how much money to give.  \"In some countries, they actually have rules where you purchase or give money to the cost of how much it would cost for each person to attend the reception,\\'\\' she says.  \"If you think the cost of the reception may be about $120 a head, the guest should contribute that much for the gift. So if it\\'s one person, it\\'s about $120 or $150, or if it\\'s two people, maybe $300. But again, it\\'s personal, it depends on how much people want to give.\\'\\'  Eibrink Jansen says there are ways to ask for money that include telling guests what the money will be spent on.  \"I always recommend my clients to put something in their invitations, whether it\\'s a special card which has a reference to a wishing well or a wishing tree,\\'\\' she says.',\n",
       " 'DJ WEALTH ADVISER: Donor-Advised Funds \\'Double\\' Bottom Line --Donors are looking harder at the choices within their donor-advised funds  --Advisers need to understand socially aware investments  --Some predict donors\\' interest in the \"double bottom line\" will continue to grow          By Veronica Dagher      A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN     NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Deb Wetherby, a San Francisco fee-based certified financial planner, has taken a closer look at the $500,000 in investments one of her clients had in a donor-advised fund invested in large- and small-cap U.S. stocks.  The client felt that some of the companies did not reflect her values. So Wetherby found a fund run by RSF Social Finance, which had what appeared to be a more congenial social impact and comparable returns.  \"More clients are interested in achieving a double-bottom line with their charitable dollars,\" she said.  Only a small number of donor-advised funds also have social impact investment screens or goals, but they are attracting more interest. For example, the socially responsible pool within Schwab Charitable, the second-largest national donor-advised fund by assets after Fidelity Charitable, has more than tripled to $7.5 million since its introduction in 2009. The pool is invested in the Parnassus Equity Income Fund (PRBLX).  Kim Laughton, Schwab Charitable\\'s president, expects interest to grow steadily over the next 10 years as investors continue to seek \"good returns without harming society over the long term.\" Laughton said investors will increasingly look for investing opportunities that do no long-term harm as they realize they don\\'t need to sacrifice return.  Schwab has also seen an uptick in clients with $250,000 or more seeking to invest in socially responsible hedge funds, venture capital deals and private equity funds--for example, a fund for timber conservation.  Meanwhile, the roughly $65 million donor-advised fund of nonprofit financial services company ImpactAssets has grown 33% a year over each of the last three years, said Fran Seegull, its managing director of investments. The company\\'s Giving Fund focuses on sustainable agriculture, affordable housing, and health and education in the developing world. It is also building an online platform for financial advisers to learn about impact investing and tap into a global database of relevant debt and equity fund managers. Advisers can engage clients in \"a dialogue about their values and deepen the relationship,\" Seegull said.  (Veronica Dagher is a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires who focuses on wealth management.

In 2010, the SEC proposed rule changes to address concerns regarding target date fund names and information presented in target date fund marketing materials, Rominger said in a speech before securities lawyers. To date, Rominger (left) continued, target date fund disclosures have been tested on about 1,000 investors.  \"After we analyze the testing data and consider public comments on the proposed rule, the division will evaluate whether to recommend that the commission adopt rule changes to address target date funds,\" she said. \\xa0  As of October, assets in target date funds had reached approximately $360 billion, Rominger said. The new cash flow that target date funds netted in 2010, she said, was over 10 times what it was 10 years ago. She cited a recent survey that found that 70% of U.S. employers use target date funds as the default investment in their defined contribution plans.  \"The increasing significance of target date funds in 401(k) retirement plans--together with the market losses suffered in 2008-gave rise to concerns about those funds.\"  The SEC, Rominger said, will continue in 2012 to incorporate \"empirical data\" into the regulatory process. The SEC\\'s oversight of money market funds, she said, \"is a good example of our continued focus on improving information collection and utilization.\"  As a result of the first phase of money market reform approved by the commission in February 2010, the SEC has been receiving detailed holdings data for each of the past 12 months, which is submitted via form N-MFP and is \"extensively analyzed and considered by the SEC staff,\" Rominger explained.  In the last year, the SEC has received filings from over 650 money market funds each month, or about 8,000 filings altogether. Each month, she said, \"these funds report about 70,000 different positions in all their portfolios, and we are using the data to monitor characteristics and trends of holdings, and to identify areas that raise questions.\" This data will also help us better assist other regulators with systemic risk monitoring responsibilities, such as Treasury and the Federal Reserve.  The data, she continued, is increasingly used as a point of reference during examinations. \"As our IM staff participates in exams of money market funds, we will occasionally ask questions about holdings and trends.

Yet Dunn, who died Sunday at 58 after a long battle with cancer, deserves credit from any investor who has ever owned an exchange-traded fund.  As the head of Barclays Global Investors in the late 1990s, Dunn supported efforts to put the global money manager\\'s considerable muscle behind a relatively unproven investment that tracked an index but traded like a stock. Just over a decade later, the mammoth iShares suite of ETFs that BGI created is the largest ETF provider, and asset management powerhouse BlackRock Inc (BLK, US)\\xa0runs that show.  When iShares rolled out in 2000, the rebranding of a BGI product called World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS, the ETF business was growing but its potential was still unclear.  Traditional mutual-fund companies then, as now, didn\\'t want to finance a product that might cannibalize their lineup, but BGI was an institutional index-fund manager and its fortune wasn\\'t tied to active fund management. Even still, Dunn battled opposition within BGI to developing the iShares line.  Dunn was no stranger to indexing, or to taking on an unpopular fight. She\\'d joined Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, a numbers-crunching San Francisco based shop, as a part-time secretary, and was there when the firm launched the first index fund in the early 1970s. (The fund was institutional only; several years later their work attracted attention from an enterprising fund industry veteran named John Bogle, who saw index funds as ideal vehicles for his new retail-oriented company The Vanguard Group.)  Dunn rose through the ranks at Wells Fargo and ascended to the top of the Investment Advisors business in 1995, the same year British banking company Barclays Plc bought the Wells unit and renamed it Barclays Global Investors.  Dunn stepped down as BGI\\'s CEO in 2002 for health reasons, and resigned from BGI\\'s board in 2006 after the California attorney general filed felony charges against her related to the H-P scandal. The charges were later dropped.  In the late 1990s I interviewed Dunn for a magazine assignment and she spoke of BGI\\'s plan to push ETFs into the mainstream. Dunn was cautiously optimistic.  She and her team didn\\'t know what to expect, she said, but we think ETFs are a \"better mousetrap.\"  Then, the ETF industry had about $80 billion under wraps.

       " 'FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY New round of QE to cut pension income Pensions  £75bn injection set to hit annuity rates by buying up gilts and lowering their yields, writes Alice Ross  Savers approaching retirement have been warned that they could face a reduced income from their pensions after the Bank of England decided this week to launch a fresh round of quantitative easing .  The decision by the Bank to inject a further £75bn into the economy by buying gilts is likely to lead to lower annuity rates, experts say - at a time when the amount of income that people can buy with their pension funds is already at a record low .  More demand for gilts is likely to lower their yields, which are used by insurance companies to determine how much income for life they can offer through annuities.  Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that in the aftermath of the first round of quantitative easing, in 2009, there were 18 annuity rate cuts and just two rises.  \"The need to stimulate the economy is only too clear but an unfortunate side-effect of quantitative easing is that it will result in another cut in pensioners\\' income at a time when they can ill-afford it,\" said Billy Mackay, marketing director at AJ Bell, the pensions provider.  This week, PwC warned that people approaching retirement faced a \"double whammy\" of falling pension values due to the stock market slump, and low annuity rates. It calculated that pension incomes are now 30 per cent lower than they were three years ago.  A pension pot of £300,000 now buys just £18,500 a year, down from £22,500 a year in 2008 - but stock market falls will also have had an impact.  \"Many people retiring now will be caught between a rock and a hard place,\" said Peter McDonald, a partner at PwC. \"If they defer buying an annuity until prices improve, they\\'re stuck with no income in the meantime, which might not be an option.\"  McPhail said it was crucial that anyone approaching retirement shops around for an annuity to make sure they get the best possible income - which can vary by up to 40 per cent from different providers.  A new agreement coming into force will prevent insurers from including annuity purchase forms in their pre-retirement packs - which can result in consumers missing out on the best deal, because they do not realise they are under no obligation to buy an annuity from their existing pension provider.  Smokers or those in poor health should also check to see whether they are eligible for impaired - or enhanced - annuities, as these often pay better rates, based on life expectancy.  McPhail said that anyone hoping markets would recover and the value of their pension would rise should consider phasing their annuity purchases. This can involve buying an annuity to last a year or two using just a small slice of the overall pension pot.  \\'Think twice\\', Page 7',\n",

(MarketWatch) - Imagine a car that delivers great handling, good power, and lots of driving fun. Now imagine that car being largely ignored by the general public.  That is the problem confronting BMW (BMW, XE)\\xa0and other exporters of diesel-powered cars to the U.S.  Although diesels are embraced in Europe, largely because of the high price of gasoline, Americans tend to shy away from them in droves, having been caught behind too many black-smoke-belching (older) trucks and buses. Another turn-off is that diesel fuel prices in the U.S. tend to be higher than gasoline.  But newer diesels, like the one in the BMW 335d, have given up black smoke as a bad part of their diet.  In the week the 335d was in the test fleet, only once did I detect the slight smell of diesel - and never inside the car. And never was there a hint of smoke.  But it's the torque that attracts drivers to the diesel burners.  The twin-turbo 3.0-liter diesel six in the test car packs 265 horsepower at 4,200 rpm, but generates 425 pound-feet of torque at just 1,750 rpm. Tied to a fast-acting 6-speed automatic, the 335d will go from standing still to 60 mph in just over 6 seconds.  There always seemed to be a wallop of acceleration just standing by waiting to be used. And then there's the diesel's promise of long life.  Much of the rest of the car is pure 3 series with outstanding handling and braking. Anyone who has driven one lately will feel right at home inside.  Interior space is fine for two adults, crowded for four. The instruments are easy to read and key controls come readily to hand.  Yet on occasion, some of the more complex controls continue to burp, requiring trips to the dealer and a car out of service.  Judging from owner comments posted on websites of various publications, these concerns generally revolve around BMW's iDrive. The test car was glitch-free.  It would also seem to me that forward progress on a trip will be slowed considerably if the owner is parked in a rest area reading news headlines, sports, weather, his or her e-mail and probably several other things that have been added since this system went to market. Set the navigation system before you leave, and hit the road, Jack.  And that alone should please anyone who likes to drive. The BMW would leave you smiling enough, even if it had a simpler system than the iDrive. This 3 series diesel, all in all, is another Bavarian treat.  This is one Bavarian treat that proves the pleasures on top of a diesel-powered drive train, says Ron Amadon.|103\",\n",

       " 'CHAIRMAN BAUCUS AND RANKING MEMBER GRASSLEY APPLAUD PASSAGE OF BILL TO INCREASE TAX FAIRNESS, DETER TAX SHELTERS BY ELIMINATING PATENTS ON TAX STRATEGIES WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued the following news release:  Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and senior Committee member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today applauded the Senate\\'s passage of their bill to protect taxpayers and fight tax evasion, which was included in the larger patent reform bill. The Baucus-Grassley legislation prevents any individual or firm from patenting tax strategies, which could otherwise subject taxpayers to royalty fees for using the patented strategy when filing their taxes. The bill also stops tax patents from providing windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by preventing them from holding exclusive rights to use loopholes, which could provide some businesses with unfair advantages over their competitors. Now that both the House and Senate have passed the patent reform bill, it goes to the President for his signature.  \"Unfair patents can give a small number of people a stranglehold on tax strategies that should be open to anyone,\" Baucus said. \"This bill will bring fairness to the system, and it will deter the use of tax shelters to evade the responsibility we all share. Our ongoing tax reform effort will continue cleaning up the code, and it can create jobs and be a major boost to our economy.\"  \"Tax strategy patents are on the rise. More and more legal tax strategies are unavailable or more expensive for more and more taxpayers,\" Grassley said. \"It\\'s important to protect intellectual property rights for true tax preparation and financial management software. At the same time, we have to protect the right of taxpayers to have equal access to legal tax strategies. That\\'s necessary for fairness and tax compliance. We need more tax compliance, not less.\"  In order to obtain a patent, an inventor must show, among other things, that the claimed invention is novel and non-obvious and has a practical application. In 1998, the courts determined that a method of doing business may be patentable, and soon thereafter, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office began granting patents for various tax-related inventions.  Tax practitioners have long decried the issuance of these tax-strategy patents because they are unlikely to be novel, given the public nature of the tax code, and undermine the fairness of the Federal tax system by removing from the public domain particular ways of satisfying a taxpayer\\'s legal obligations. The bill expressly provides that a strategy for reducing, avoiding or deferring tax liability cannot be considered a new or non-obvious idea, and therefore, a patent on a tax strategy cannot be obtained.  Baucus and Grassley have long been leaders in congressional efforts to protect taxpayers and prevent the patenting of tax strategies that result in extra costs for taxpayers.

       " 'PARTNER FOCUS Why BOLI in today\\'s interest rate environment? Banks continue to be challenged by a shrinking net interest margin as well as high liquidity. Identifying acceptable investment opportunities with high credit quality and diversification continues to challenge most banks today. In addition, most banks are affected by the increasing cost of providing employee benefits.  As we have stated before, bankowned life insurance (BOLD continues to be an acceptable and prevalent solution to these challenges. Texas banks continue to explore BOLI and consider the BOLI yields available today as a partial solution to these challenges. According to the FDIC and Equias Alliance research, 52 percent of Texas banks with assets greater than $100 million owned BOLI assets as of March 31, 2011. In addition, highly rated insurance companies are offering very attractive BOLI yields and policy structures that most banks find acceptable for their overall portfolio strategy.  The annual yield on a BOLI investment compares favorably to other bank-eligible assets. Also, BOLI provides tax advantaged income not available with traditional bank investments. Banks earn income from the growth of the BOLI cash value and from the life insurance proceeds paid to the bank on the death of the Insured employee. In addition, the income earned from BOLI is tax deferred, and, if the BOLI contract is held until the death of the insured, the bank receives life insurance proceeds tax free. Growth in cash value is recorded as \"Other Non- Interest Income\" on the bank\\'s financial statements.  As the owner and beneficiary of the BOLI policies, the management or board will typically select a group of bank officers to insure. This group may or may not participate in any executive benefit plans. While BOLI is not tied directly to the employee benefit programs, the policy income is designed to recover a portion of the employee benefit expenses.  Remember that BOLI is used as a cost recovery vehicle for pre- and post-retirement employee benefits, such as individual or group life insurance, health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, tuition reimbursement, deferred compensation and pension benefits. Also, remember to consider the interagency guidance as outlined in OCC-2004-56 regarding the purchase and administration of BOLI.

He tapped everybody he knew for help, and after an intensive six-month search, he landed a job as an account executive for 77 WABC Radio in New York, where he\\'s been working since 2008.  \"On the surface, it looks like a failure,\" Mr. Dvorkin says of having lost two jobs in a relatively short time. But when interviewing for a new position, \"I didn\\'t downplay the layoffs,\" he says. \"I knew they\\'d ask, so I turned the layoffs into a positive, learning experience.\"  While laid-off employees may be tempted to lean on their severance for a few months, the best thing to do is get right back into the job market, says Tim Honn, founder and president of Fortis Recruiting Solutions, in Lisle, Ill.Mr. Honn says he advises his clients to put a plan together and act as quickly as they can after losing a job.  \"It\\'s one thing to take a week off to recharge your batteries,\" he says. \"If someone takes a protracted vacation to find themselves, it\\'s hard to sell this to search-firm owners like me and employers.\"  Finding work should be regarded as a full-time job. Schedule your entire day with job-hunting activities like making calls, sending résumés and getting training that you need to update your skills. Keep healthy eating habits and get regular exercise to reduce stress and boost self-confidence.  Create a budget that slashes your overhead in case the job search goes longer than expected. Mr. Dvorkin moved back in with his parents and says his savings helped him be more selective in his job search.  If you\\'re feeling burned out from a prolonged job search, or perhaps you\\'ve figured out that your previous line of work is no longer right for you, consider what changes or new training might help you qualify for a better job, or at least one that is a better fit.  \"Redirect your anger into finding work.

       " 'Your Money YOURMONEY.com,au Low-rent returns PROPERTY investors are facing fresh headwinds with rental income growth stuck below the pace of inflation.  As new research from RP Data shows, capital city rents over the past year have grown just 2.7 per cent, and financial experts say there are wider long-term forces at play for real estate investors to consider.  Australia\\'s latest annual inflation rate is 3.3 per cent, and will be updated next week.  RP Data found Brisbane\\'s median rent for houses is $370 a week and has not grown over the past three months. It is up just 2.8 per cent over the past year but 37 per cent higher over the past five years.  Brisbane\\'s median rent for units is now $365 a week and is up 1.4 per cent for the June quarter, up 2.8 per cent for the past year and up 43.1 per cent for the past five years.  \"As many investors will be aware, rental growth has been relatively subdued since 2008 due to a number of factors such as stimulus from low interest rates and the First Home Owner Grant boost which enticed prospective new homeowners into buying and eased demand for rentals,\" RP Data analyst Cameron Kusher says.  He expects stronger growth in the year ahead because depressed sales volumes and inactive first-home buyers should lead to increased competition for rental stock.  In the long term, structural changes in the rental market may also have an affect on investors\\' future returns.  New research by RAMS Home Loans suggests many Generation Y Australians are avoiding rentals and preferring instead to move straight from their family home into their own property.  Its survey of mortgage holders aged under 30 found 71 per cent have never rented.  \"What we are increasingly seeing is younger Australians using this time to save for their own home instead and avoiding renting,\\'\\' RAMS chief executive Melos Sulicich says.  The next wave of young Australians - dubbed Generation Z - may become a generation of renters who do not aspire to own a home, Resi Mortgage Corporation CEO Lisa Montgomery says.  \"This generation will have witnessed their Gen X parents juggle and leverage themselves in order to buy the property they want - whereas for Gen Z that idea is increasingly less attractive,\\'\\' she says.  In some European countries young people have no great aspirations for home ownership, Montgomery says.  \"Parents of Gen Z are still holding the cards in their hands at the moment,\\'\\' she says.  \"Because if their children don\\'t create their own financial security through strategies such as property ownership, this may in turn affect the retirement plans of parents as well - leading to an unwelcome financial domino effect.  \"Education for children in relation to how they view money and how they manage finances is vital. If that education and life lessons don\\'t come from their parents, they can only rely on internet and other information sources.\\'\\'',\n",
       " \"Calgary Business A trust will protect your estate A s the Canadian population ages and their personal wealth increases, a growing number of couples have become concerned about the potential negative financial consequences of passing their estates on to their children.  Many Canadian couples will die with a net worth of $1-million or more and a surprising number of these couples have never properly planned on how this wealth will be transferred to the next generation.  The life-insurance industry has played a major role in developing financial products and policies to assist in the transfer of wealth in a tax-efficient manner at death; but life insurance is only one factor that older Canadians should consider when planning their estates.  What if you are leaving wealth to a disabled child? What about a cottage being left to multiple children that do not get along? What if you don't want your child's spouse or common-law partner to gain access to your child's inheritance upon the failure of their relationship? A solution to these and many similar problems could be a testamentary trust.  A trust is created when one party (the settlor) transfers assets to a trust and another party is responsible to deal with the assets (the trustee) for the benefit of named parties (beneficiaries). All this is done based on instructions that you have left to the trustee on how the assets and income they generate are to be used.  A testamentary trust is created by a will and becomes effective at one's death. Testamentary trusts can have several benefits, including tax benefits, protection of assets from creditors and family separation, and control of assets for disabled or spendthrift children.  One of the major benefits of a testamentary trust is the protection of assets from creditors and spouses of beneficiaries. By settling a trust in your will and transferring your child's inheritance to this trust, you can potentially shield these assets from anyone attempting to make a claim against your child.  This works by transferring your child's inheritance to a trust rather than to your child, so you are creating a legal barrier between your child and the assets held in trust. Technically speaking, your child does not own the assets or have the ability to get to the assets; they are owned by the trust.  If your child is in a profession or business prone to litigation, this is an excellent way to protect his/her inheritance from potential seizure. Further, if your child is in a rocky marriage, settling a trust can prevent the integration of your child's inheritance into family property, thereby preventing any claims to the assets should your child be involved in divorce proceedings.  Settling a testamentary trust can be fraught with legal and tax complications. It is important to engage competent advisors when considering any type of estate plan. However, with a bit of proper planning, the benefits can greatly outweigh the efforts spent.\",\n",
       " 'Rebate cut may hurt hospital NOOSA Hospital could be facing increased pressure to treat people and be forced to divert more patients to Nambour if a Federal Government means-test on private health insurance forces more than 1.6 million Australians to turn to the public sector for treatment over five years.  The Australian Health Insurance Association commissioned company Deloitte to report on the likely impacts of the government\\'s policy to means-test the 30% rebate on private health insurance  The AHIA says the report rejects the Australian treasury\\'s projections that only 25,000 people will drop their private health cover, instead estimating that 175,000 Australians will drop their cover in the first year alone.  And it warns that the cost of servicing the increased demand for public hospitals will outweigh the savings to government from means-testing the 30% rebate.  Noosa Hospital CEO Oli Steele said his management team had real concerns about the patient health outcomes if the AHIA research proved more accurate.  Mr Steele said Noosa patients would increasingly seek treatment in the public sector if they opted out of or reduced their private health insurance cover.  \"This year approximately 10,000 private patients will be treated at Noosa Hospital,\" he said.  \"A notional 10% reduction in private health insurance rates would mean 20 patients a week seeking treatment in the public sector who might otherwise have been treated here as a private patient.\"  Mr Steele said this would be at a time when other formerly insured patients from Nambour, Gympie and Buderim would be attempting to access the public health system, thus increasing pressure on waiting times for Sunshine Coast patients.  \"Noosa patients presenting to our emergency department could increasingly need to be transferred to Nambour general,\" Mr Steele said.  \"Currently emergency department patients with private insurance can be, and are, admitted as private patients to the hospital,\" he said.  \"A reduction in private health cover in the area and of our many interstate travellers would put more strain on Noosa public beds, increasing the need for transfer.\"  \"This might have a resource impact for QAS as well as colleagues at Nambour general,\" he said.  Mr Steele said the \"mixed economy\" of public and private work at 92-bed Noosa hospital enabled many visiting medical officers to supplement their public earnings with a private income.  \"There is a potential threat that some (officers) might stop coming to Noosa if they find it isn\\'t financially viable,\" he said.  Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon this week reportedly rejected Deloitte\\'s report by claiming the private health opt-out findings were based on \"general questions being asked of 2000 people via a telephone poll without all the relevant financial information\".  \"People don\\'t make decisions about budgets during phone polls; they make them in a considered fashion with all the facts available,\" Ms Roxon said.

       " 'Financial Adviser: Backlash on report\\'s proposal to replace Isas. The Institute for Public Policy Research has published a controversial report that suggests scrapping cash Isas in favour of a new lifetime bonus savings accounts.  The 48-page document, entitled Designing a Life-Course Savings Account: How to Help Low to Middle-Income Families Save More, said Isas have failed to boost savings rates and that most of the tax relief they offer goes to people who would have saved anyway.  It also claims that low to middle earners find the concept of interest payments difficult to understand and they would be more attracted by cash payments into their savings vehicles or by supermarket accounts that offered rewards in the form of in-store vouchers or loyalty cards.  Tony Dolphin, the report\\'s author, argues that abolishing the popular Isa in favour of a lifetime account would encourage saving among low to middle-income earners.  He described the cash Isa a \"tax shelter\" used by middle and high earners. He conceded that a lifetime account, which would pay an annual bonus on a sliding scale, would be \"hugely unpopular\" with middle and high earners and retired savers, but said it would be attractive for families on low to middle incomes.  The lifetime account would be a universal deposit account with a full government guarantee and a size limit of GBP10,000. Only four withdrawals would be allowed each year and the government would pay a bonus into accounts on a sliding scale, up to a maximum of GBP183.33 a year.  Interest would ideally be tax-free but if this were not possible, it should be taxed at the saver\\'s normal marginal rate. The savings would also be exempt from asset testing for welfare benefits.  The report said: \"This would allow most families to accumulate the three months\\' post-tax income. Research shows tax relief is a poor incentive to save so incentives could be liable for income tax at a person\\'s normal marginal rate.\"  Jemma Jackson, public relations manager for the Association of Investment Companies, said Isas have been successful and were established in the savings landscape.  She said: \"It seems unlikely they will be scrapped. But while any moves to encourage more low and middle-income families to save more should be welcomed, the best way to achieve this is through financial education.\"  Tony Vine-Lott, director general of the Tax Incentivised Savings Association, said: \"Some 20m people have an Isa and many are lower earners or young people so it is not just something for the rich.  \"There is a need to help low-income people but do not do it at the expense of the 20m who are successfully saving in Isas. It is counter-productive.\"  Colin Jackson, director of Essex-based Baronworth Investment Services, called the research \"absolute rubbish\". He said: \"Many of our clients are not wealthy but know the value of saving, especially with the returns being tax-free on an Isa.\"  87350744',\n",
       " \"Why it pays to navigate perils of flexible drawdown Mass market savers' hopes of gaining early access to their pension have been dashed. But for high net worth investors the door is still firmly open to flexible drawdown provided they get the right advice.  Flexible drawdown has been hailed as a 'masterstroke' by some in the pensions industry. They argue it will help stimulate saving by removing fears that all money is being locked away.  But confusion over the rules surrounding the measure could prevent some savers from taking advantage. Flexible drawdown has strengthened the case for a financial adviser. The finer details of HM Revenue & Customs' (HMRC) rules on the measure will be lost on many savers.  Pension administrators Talbot and Muir helped cut through some of the confusion last week when they relayed a clarification of the rules they had received from HMRC.  The clarification focused on the minimum income requirement (MIR) needed to qualify for flexible drawdown. That has been set at £20,000, and some have assumed it needs to be earned over 12 months. Not the case, says Talbot and Muir director of pension consultancy Nathan Bridgeman. Instead the MIR needs to be evidenced for the tax year in which flexible drawdown is taken.  Savers wanting to take flexible drawdown for the 2011/12 tax year, for example, now have 11 months to show they meet the MIR, not the 12 some had assumed.  This will impact on the way savers intend to get that income. If an annuity is used, monthly payments will need to be larger than they would had the 12-month timeline applied.  Other threats to savers qualifying for the measure include the carry forward rules and those around contributions. Contribute to your pension and you immediately disqualify yourself from taking drawdown that year. Carry forward entitlements from previous tax years to contribute and you do the same.  Advisers will therefore be crucial to helping those who would benefit from flexible drawdown to ensure they qualify for the facility, and do not slip up on any of the technicalities.  The prize for those who qualify, and are suitable for flexible drawdown, is worth the effort. Not only will those who qualify do so for life, they will also avoid the pitfalls of capped drawdown that are soon to get a lot worse.  Savers who choose capped drawdown are set to be hit by a triple whammy. First, payments will be calculated at the 100% Government Actuary's Department (GAD) rate. Second, GAD, calculated according to annuity rates, will be affected by the implementation of the European Court of Justice's ruling on gender pricing in December, which will cause annuities to fall. Third, Solvency II is on the horizon for insurers. From 1 January 2013, they will be forced to comply with higher capital adequacy requirements, leading them to put their money in safer, lower return, investments thereby hitting annuity rates.  Advisers may find that for some clients, now is the time to act.\",\n",
       " 'The Emergent Success of MyLifeAudit Life Insurance Policy Review Leads to Formation of Life Audit Professionals, LLC. Boca Raton, FL, April 20, 2011 --(PR.com)-- Managing member, Richard Newman, CPA, today announced the establishment of Life Audit Professionals, LLC, the company responsible for developing MYLIFEAUDIT, a proprietary life insurance policy review system.  MYLIFEAUDIT was developed while Newman was a partner at Newman + Cohen Financial Management along with partner Donald Cohen, and Jeremy Bloom, director of business development. MYLIFEAUDIT provides an independent and unbiased detailed analysis of life insurance policies and can be used by the estate planning community, i.e., attorneys, CPAs, and wealth managers.  When asked why there has been a critical demand for MYLIFEAUDIT, Newman said, \"As a result of the economic downturn, extended period of low interest rates, and existing policies utilizing older more expensive mortality expenses, a scenario has been created where 65-75 percent of in-force life insurance policies are underperforming. Underperformance could mean risk of lapsing, secure much higher death benefit for the same premium, or potentially lower the premium by more than 50 percent for the same death benefit in many cases. It is amazing how many times we find that policies are owned improperly which could trigger a significant tax consequence.\"  Life Audit Professionals, through its MYLIFEAUDIT process and partnership with Ash Brokerage Corporation, one of the largest privately held independent life insurance brokerage agencies in the United States, has audited thousands of policies resulting in significant policy benefit improvements to policy holders.  \"Just like a stock portfolio, bond portfolio or real estate holdings, life insurance is an asset that must be expertly managed,\" said Newman. \"We are only interested in the most appropriate product from the carrier with the highest ratings and at the best possible price.

       " \"Estates of Decedents Passing in 2010 - Extension of Election to Opt Out of Estate Tax and Allocation of Basis to Assets The April 18, 2011 deadline for filing Form 8939 - Allocation of Increase in Basis for Property Acquired From a Decedent - has been extended indefinitely by the Internal Revenue Service. Form 8939 is an informational return used to document the basis, for income tax purposes, of property acquired from the estate of a decedent who died in 2010 and for which the executor has elected out of the application of the federal estate tax. Originally, the IRS stated that Form 8939 was to be filed along with the decedent's final Form 1040 no later than April 18, 2011. The filing extension is likely due to the fact that, as of the time of the March 31st announcement, the IRS had not yet finalized and published Form 8939.  In addition, the recent IRS announcement also states that the forthcoming guidance on filing Form 8939 will provide information on the manner in which an executor of an estate of a decedent dying in 2010 may elect to have the estate tax not apply. The IRS stated that it will announce the new deadline for filing Form 8939 at some point in the future and that the revised deadline will provide for a reasonable period of time for the preparation and filing of Form 8939.  Prior to the enactment on December 6, 2010 of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act), the estate tax was repealed for decedents dying in 2010. While the Act reinstates the estate tax for 2010 decedents and provides for an estate tax exemption amount of $5,000,000, it also permits executors of the estates of 2010 decedents to elect out of the reinstatement of the federal estate tax. However, rather than taking a basis in an asset acquired from a 2010 decedent equal to the asset's current fair market value, as is the rule in cases of estate which are subject to the federal estate tax, beneficiaries acquiring assets from the estate of a decedent that has elected out of the application of the federal estate tax will take a modified carryover basis in such assets, which is to be determined by filing Form 8939. As result, provided a proper election is made, the estate of a decedent dying in 2010 will not be subject to the federal estate tax, but the executors of such electing estates are required to file Form 8939.  The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.  Mr J.

       " 'Pension reforms: little public sympathy for public sector staff Given that 10m to 15m private sector workers have no pension trade unions can expect little support from the general public  Private sector employees are unlikely to feel any sympathy for the nurses, teachers and firefighters told to retire later, take a lower payout and pay more for their pension.  Between 10 million and 15 million workers in the private sector have no pension at all. Of the remainder, most pay into retirement plans dependent on stock market returns.  In the last 10 years the market has effectively declined, leaving most with little more than the sum of their own and their employers\\' contributions in a meagre pension pot.  By contrast 90% of the public sector\\'s 5.5m workers are members of the various government-run schemes.  The career average scheme put forward by Lord Hutton as an alternative to the current final salary arrangements will mean a small cut in retirement income for lower paid staff. Final salary schemes benefit the managers and directors in an organisation, with little gain for cleaners and teaching assistants who retire on a salary almost identical to the one they started on.  So most public sector workers will be only marginally worse off compared to people in the private sector, where pension contributions by employers have halved in recent years and payouts by as much two-thirds.  Ten years of trade union campaigning to protect final salary schemes for the privileged few - ie their declining membership - has taught people to understand the benefits they might lose and want to protect them. But it is still difficult to see how they will gain widespread sympathy for their fight.  One threat floated by the government - that workers will face immediate hikes in contributions - has been ducked by Hutton, who prefers a \"cap and share\" deal that will be worked out over the next decades. Cap and share will force public sector staff to negotiate a cost-sharing arrangement when life expectancy increases or other costs of providing a pension bust the budget. Contributions from both employer and staff will rise rather than just the employer. The employee will have the option of taking a slightly lower pension benefit instead.  The Treasury could press ahead with an early rise in contributions. The chancellor, George Osborne, signalled his intent to save £1.8bn from higher contributions during the comprehensive spending review but Hutton has robbed Osborne of the political cover he craved for this measure, and it may be quietly dropped.  To most people this will seem like a fair starting point when public sector workers have already established such a high watermark. Moving to a standard 65 retirement age is something the private sector accepted a long time ago. Many will retire much later simply because their stock market-related funds have underperformed and they need to invest them for longer to produce a decent retirement income.  guardian.co.uk © Guardian News and Media 2011',\n",
       " 'Financial Adviser: Structured cash Isas may damage Isa brand: report. The potential inclusion of structured products in cash Isas could undermine the popularity of the investment vehicle, according to a report from the Tax Incentivised Savings Association.  The 152-page Isa Market report said that calls to include structured products within the traditional cash Isa would introduce an element of volatility that removes the whole rationale for investing in the low-risk product.  The report said: \"This is perceived by many as a detrimental move that could undermine the Isa brand. Isas need to continue to be simple, safe and secure to retain their reputational advantage.\"  It said that saving levels could improve if there were a review of the appropriateness of the investment vehicles, such as structured products, within cash Isas.  It also suggested that it is important for the industry to understand the changing patterns of seasonality so that Isa communication is spread throughout the year, not just in the first few months of each year.  A survey of 1500 people showed that investors turn to cash Isas when they are looking to maximise the return on their rainy day funds. This is why Isas are the third most popular financial product, the report found.  However, the report also indicated that fewer people are intending to put money into Isas this year. Some 43 per cent of those quizzed said they put money into their Isa in 2009/2010, whereas only 35 per cent stated their intention to purchase an Isa in 2010/2011.  In the FSA\\'s discussion paper DP11/1 on product intervention, the regulator said it was scrutinising the use of structured products.  Jason Witcombe, director for London-based IFA Evolve Financial Planning, said: \"I agree with Tisa that cash Isas should remain cash. If people want to opt for structured products then they can choose stocks and shares Isas. Investors in cash Isas like the simplicity of the product so any complexities will only lead to problems.\"  The report comes as Gary Shaughnessy, UK managing director for Fidelity, is heading a campaign to reinstate dividend tax credit on Isas to encourage more people to use these as part of their retirement planning.  He said he will be talking to the Treasury and the government about bringing back the tax credit for normal rate taxpayers, which was removed in 2003.  Mr Shaughnessy said: \"Isas are popular and people understand there is a tax advantage to them and that they are flexible. The removal of the dividend tax credit was unnecessary for a relatively small amount of money for the Treasury. The savings ratio is not where it needs to be, particularly for base-rate taxpayers, and we need to give people every incentive to save through Isas.\"  Philip Church, proprietor for Glasgow-based Pension Investment Management, said: \"People understand the concept of Isas more than pensions and if these proposals are a way to encourage more people to save, they should be considered.\"  85651619',\n",

       " 'EDITORIAL: Chief\\'s retirement points to problem Dec. 26--We hate to use someone we admire as an example of a system gone awry.  But in this case, we must.  The retirement of Redlands Police Chief Jim Bueermann at age 53, when he\\'s in the prime of his ability to manage a police department, is another downside to the generous pension benefits afforded to public employees.  Bueermann is nationally and internationally known as an expert in modern policing techniques. He advises about a dozen boards and institutions across the United States, and even in the United Kingdom, on law enforcement techniques and policies. He\\'s a charter member of the Society of Police Futurists International.  Bueermann was one of 100 law enforcement leaders, mayors and scholars from across the nation invited to the White House Conference on Gang Violence and Crime Control last year.  George Mason University inducted Bueermann this year into its Center for Evidence- Based Crime Policy Hall of Fame. \"These innovative leaders translate findings from research into everyday tactics and strategies to improve the legitimacy and effectiveness of law enforcement,\" the deputy director of that center said of Bueermann and the other members of the first class of inductees.  Bueermann\\'s department has been featured on Apple.com for its use of the iPhone and iPad in crime-fighting efforts.  Clearly, the Redlands chief is no slouch when it comes to policing and to directing a department.  Does anyone think this guy is past his prime at 53, ready to hang up his holster and rock on the porch?  No, he\\'s at the top of his game, on the young side actually for a top-level administrator.  But he\\'s been working for the Redlands Police Department since 1978, chief since 1998. Under the 3 at 30 pension rules, he can retire now and draw about 96 percent of his final salary as a pension.  Why would he stay?  He\\'s been incentivized to quit, draw a large pension and take another high-level job somewhere else.  We greatly admire Jim Bueermann and the work he has done as Redlands chief of police. We wish him all the best, while thinking he could and should do a great job of running a police department for another decade at least. We understand that from a personal perspective, he should do whatever gives him the best opportunity to flourish and use his abilities.  At the same time, the 3 at 30 retirement plans for safety personnel are clearly too generous, giving strong incentives to top-notch people to retire too early. Our view is that pensions should be withheld until civil servants actually retire.  It should make people comfortable in their retirement, not allow them to collect essentially two generous salaries at once.  -----  To see more of the San Bernardino County Sun, or to subscribe to the newspaper, go to http://www.sbsun.com.

       " \"Search Summary  Pension fund $881m loss  504 words 30 September 2008 The Daily Post (New Zealand) APNTDP A08 English Copyright 2008 APN New Zealand Ltd - Regionals. All Rights Reserved        Tumbling world stock markets have taken a toll on the taxpayer-backed New Zealand Superannuation Fund, which still retains bipartisan political support after its $881 million loss.  The so-called Cullen Fund - into which the Government pumps about $2 billion every year to help to fund future pension payments - felt the fallout of turbulent markets and reported the hefty after-tax loss in the year to June 30.  Before tax the loss was $716 million and, as a percentage, the fund's return was negative 4.92 per cent before tax.  The super fund still has a solid positive return over its lifetime but the negative result in the past year will have an impact on the Government's accounts, which are set to be released on Monday.  Finance Minister Michael Cullen yesterday urged people to remember the super fund was a long-term proposition.  ``Not many investors in global equities would have avoided incurring mark-to- market losses in the value of their shareholdings late last year and in the first half of 2008.''  Indeed, the fund - with its mixture of largely overseas shareholdings, local stocks and a variety of other property and fixed-interest investments - was expected to have a tough year given the ill-health of financial markets.  It will not, however, become a political football in the election campaign.  National's finance spokesman, Bill English, yesterday reinforced his party's position on the fund, saying a National-led government would keep it and continue contributing at the amounts required under current legislation.  ``They have been affected in the same way as pretty much every other investment in the developed world,'' he said. ``At times like these, you need to take a long- term view.''  Mr English said the fund's average return since it began was still ``fairly solid'' and National hoped markets would bottom out and turn around so the fund could get its returns back up again.  ``We want to keep the fund and we will follow the formula in the legislation,'' Mr English said.  The amount that goes into the fund each year from the Government is determined by a complicated formula and it has actually edged above $2 billion a year.  That means there is not as much money available for the Government to spend on other things.  As the fund gets bigger it also has a more noticeable impact on the Government's accounts.  In recent years the fund's positive earnings have helped to inflate big surpluses, and now its negative returns will do the opposite.  At the end of its June 30 financial year, the fund's overall assets had grown to $14.13 billion and it will get much larger before it is ever used to help pay for future pension payments.  Under law, no capital withdrawal is allowed before July 1, 2020.  It will still only partially fund the cost of pension payments, which are set to skyrocket due to the ageing New Zealand population.  - NZ Herald\",\n",
       " \"Greens push for ethical shares The ACT Greens want to see commitment to ethical investment in the next Assembly beyond merely signing up to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment.Lead candidate for Brindabella Amanda Bresnan criticised the Government for ''failing to follow through'' after becoming a signatory after pressure from Greens MLA Deb Foskey and the scandal of ACT Government investments in cluster bombs and tobacco. ''These immoral investments remain,'' she said. ''The Chief Minister has not used his shareholder status to ask a single question about  the operations of the businesses the Government invests in. ''The ACT Government fund managers do not appear to have taken any active steps to cut our investments in contentious industries or lift our game on the social or environmental front.'' The Government ought to set the ethical guidelines in which fund managers worked, Ms Bresnan said. The Greens would look to include negative screening against industries deemed undesirable and positive screening to encourage investment in industries such as renewable energy development in the ACT Government investment guidelines. The party wants a minimal percentage investment commitment to  ethnical industries of perhaps 10per cent in the first instance, to be increased incrementally annually. Ethical investment could help given the state of the financial markets, according to Ms Bresnan, ''Ethical shares are very stable and would be a suitable thing to have money invested in.'' This follows the revelation that the ACT Government is set to lose up to $700,000 out of the financial crisis, with another $1.2million potentially at risk. However, Treasury is not changing its economic forecast, saying the losses will be chalked up to the ups and downs of the financial markets. The Government had $680,000 invested in a Lehman Brothers fixed-  interest pooled fund. The company filed for bankruptcy before parts of the business were acquired by Barclays days later. The Government was unable to say how much of that money was lost. There was a further $36,000 in a pooled fund consisting of shares held in Lehmans that money was not expected to be recovered. Chief Minister and Treasurer Jon Stanhope said the losses represented a small proportion of ACT investments, with an overall investment portfolio of more than $3billion. ''The ACT Government manages a fully diversified portfolio of investments which minimises the consequences of an individual failure,'' he said.  The risk for the ACT finances does not end there. Treasury also has $400,000 invested in insurance company AIG which received a bail-out from the United States Government. And there is a further $800,000 invested in troubled group HBOS. This is on top of short-term losses from $1.2million invested in a pooled investment vehicle that evenly invests across the share market.A Treasury spokesman said he was confident the losses would be recovered in the long term. The Canberra Party's Richard Mulcahy said he was pleased Treasury had minimised the risk to the ACT's investments.  11325616\",\n",

       " \"Lehman collapse raises questions for money market funds In the US, the money market fund sector has been rocked by reports that one of the oldest and biggest funds is in trouble.  On Tuesday the Reserve Primary Fund 'broke the buck', which means its share price fell below $1. This is never supposed to happen to a fund designed to be a safe haven for cash.  Fears that problems may spread to other funds in the sector have now subsided, after providers moved quickly to reassure investors.  Investors began to bale out of the Reserve fund, which had around $60 billion in assets at the end of last week, because of concerns that it held commercial paper issued by Lehman Brothers as well as simpler, more traditional cash instruments.  By Tuesday the fund had lost around two thirds of its assets and there was a growing threat that investors would exit the sector en masse.  That threat now looks to have been averted. But could a similar situation arise in the UK?  Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown believes not, partly because relatively few UK investors have been drawn to these types of funds.  'Money market funds have never really taken off here,' Dampier said.  Building societies have always been the cornerstone of most investors' allocation to cash, he said. 'Money market funds are not as mainstream here, because they're not really understood.'  Dampier said it was important to distinguish between two types of money market funds: investment and treasury. The investment type of money market funds are not guaranteed, offer higher yield but are higher risk, he said. These funds may hold short term commercial paper and other debt instruments, while the treasury variety is simply pure cash instruments such as loans and deposits.  There is a good case for regarding the second category as a relatively safe investment, Dampier believes. One of the problems in the US, he believes, is that differences between these types of funds were only clear if you examined the detail of the prospectuses.  'In America, the regulator has not been that great at making it clear which is which.' And with interest rates so low, he said, investors were searching for yield and did not always look too closely at what they bought.  In the UK, Fidelity is among the leading providers of money market funds. A spokesman for the group said: 'Our cash funds are treasury style money market funds, which means they have a stable NAV, and not investment style cash funds - also known asenhanced yield cash funds -which are usually short-term bond funds and do not have a stable NAV.'  'Both types can be found in the IMA money market sector but there is definitely a very significant difference.

Have a gamble, and get your (Government-guaranteed) money back whenever you need it! The simplicity is appealing when so many other investments are going down the drain.  Savers stashed £15.5bn into National Savings in 2007/08 and 43% of that - some £6.6bn - bought Premium Bonds, by far its biggest seller.  According to National Savings and Investments (NS&I) last year alone, money invested in National Savings saved taxpayers £375m by reducing the cost of Government borrowing. Nearly half that saving - around £170m - presumably came from Premium Bonds.  In September\\'s draw, ERNIE 4 is paying out over 1.6m prizes, worth more than £104m. Some 36.8bn Premium Bonds are eligible for a prize.  It\\'s been a remarkable boom and continues despite the promise of NS&I chief executive Jane Platt, in her 2007/08 report, to \"shift the emphasis away from this product by bringing other key products to the fore.\"  In 1997, when Mr Brown began his Chancellorship, savers held £8.6bn in Premium Bonds. Now it\\'s nearly £36.5bn.  In one month alone - October 2006 - we sank a record £2.2bn into Premium Bonds when their 50th anniversary was marked by five £1m monthly jackpots. Around 400,000 people hold the maximum investment allowed of £30,000.  Nearly £30m worth of Premium Bond prizes still wait to be collected. Long-forgotten winning numbers can be traced on the NS&I website.  The late-1990s surge in Premium Bond buying enabled NS&I to double its jackpot to two £1m winners in August 2005.  Maybe the National Lottery - which means millions of people actually losing money every Saturday night - makes Premium Bonds more attractive, because the gambling chips are never lost.  Possibly we buy in the Titanic spirit: let\\'s have a gamble to keep spirits up.  In my case, whenever a regular National Savings mailshot falls through the letter box, I check our current account to see if any spare cash is earning a derisory 0.10% interest at Lloyds TSB and bung another £200 off to the Premium Bonds HQ.  I suppose my wife and I are too lazy to find a better, more accessible place for the cash. Four or five years ago, our Premium Bond winnings held steady around £1,000 a year.  Since then our stake has steadily increased and winnings have shrunk.  But I still got a shock when I tallied up winnings for 2008 - a measly £200.  If our Premium Bond stake was safely invested in a building society account paying around 6%, it would gross nearly £1,300 per year. Are we really paying more than £1,000 a year for the vain hope of becoming millionaires?',\n",
       " 'Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content: The high cost of capital guarantees. COMMENT: Structured products appear to offer stock market growth but without the risk. But it isn\\'t that simple, and you shouldn\\'t take structured products at face value  The Investment Management Association, which represents the fund management industry, is getting hot under the collar about the increasing popularity of structured products called guaranteed equity bonds (GEBs), that are luring investors away from traditional funds.  Investors worried about stock market volatility are flocking to GEBs because they offer both a return related to growth of the stock market and a guarantee against capital loss. But these products should not be taken at face value.  The IMA has taken performance data from National Savings &Investment\\'s five GEB issues since April 2007 and compared them with the return from a FTSE 100 index tracking fund.  The interesting comparison shows that after taking account of the typical 1 per cent annual charge in the index tracker, GEBs are underperforming the stock market by about 4.5 per cent a year. Fine, you may say, this is to be expected from a product that only gives you a proportion of stock market uplifts. But then examine the underlying reasons why you are buying - to do a bit better than sticking your cash in the building society.  Richard Saunders, chief executive of the IMA, points out that the 4.5 per cent performance margin is very close to many economists\\' estimates of the current \"equity risk premium\". In other words the returns from GEBs can be expected over time to be much closer to risk-free investment such as cash deposits and gilts than to the stock market. Why bother, you now think? Oh yes, the guaranteed capital.  But while GEBs offer a guarantee against the index falling over a five year period, the IMA points out that that is a relatively unusual event. Before 2002, the last time it was down over five years was in 1978.  Although structured products can help investors to sleep well at night, there are other reasons why you may think twice about them. They aren\\'t always transparent, for example, it can be difficult to find out who is the counterparty guaranteeing the capital. There is also an opportunity cost - you don\\'t get the return from dividends. For this reason, Rob Pemberton, investment director at HFM Columbus Asset Management, is not keen on products linked to FTSE indices.  But I don\\'t want to be too negative as there are many exciting structured products from niche players such as Quantum Asset Management (www.dawnaydayquantum.com) that can play useful roles in your portfolio. Mr Pemberton says: \"Structured products are good for high risk/high reward asset classes, especially those that don\\'t have income streams, for example commodities and emerging markets where you don\\'t get much of a yield.\"  For a tour of the best structured products, see next week\\'s issue.  66757473',\n",
       " \"Local No benefit for low-income earners - TAX BLUEPRINT SUPERANNUATION  THE massive tax concessions provided to superannuation are benefiting mainly high-income earners who would be saving money anyway.  The Henry tax review shows that 1.2 million low-income people who are making superannuation contributions receive no tax benefit at all, because the lowest income tax bracket is now 15 per cent, the same as the tax on contributions.  A further 1.2 million people receive gains of only 1.5 per cent, the same as the Medicare levy.  The review quotes Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development findings that the success of tax incentives in raising savings depends on the level of take-up by moderate-income households.  ``Higher-income households are more likely to respond by switching their existing savings,'' the review says.  Treasury says that if tax concessions for retirement savings simply result in people switching their existing savings -- for example, transferring their share portfolio into a superannuation fund -- the result is likely to be lower national savings overall.  The discussion paper released yesterday does not include any recommendations for change; however, the Government has ruled out any alteration in arrangements for the tax-free treatment of superannuation payments for people aged over 60.  The report suggests taxation of savings is inconsistent, with interest on bank deposits being treated harshly, while negatively geared property and shares are rewarded.  Australia is out of line with other nations in taxing savings and capital overall too heavily, it says. However, the concessions to superannuation, which swamp all other forms of tax benefit, introduce the greatest distortion.  The report shows the cost of superannuation tax concessions has risen to $27 billion a year, and it is expected to reach $31billion by 2010-11.  For people on high incomes, more than $160,000 a year, the tax saving on superannuation is equivalent to 31.5c in the dollar, while someone on average earnings of about $55,000 gets a benefit of 16.5c in the dollar.  The advantage of superannuation benefits for people on lower incomes, including a large proportion of the part-time workforce, has been eroded by personal income tax cuts, which have reduced the difference from the superannuation concession of paying tax of 15c in the dollar.  The Howard government sought to make superannuation more attractive for low-income earners by introducing the co-contribution scheme.  There are 1.4 million people taking advantage of that scheme, reaping a benefit of $1.1 billion this year. However, Treasury says this is only 20 per cent of the people who would be eligible for the scheme if they made voluntary superannuation contributions.  For a taxpayer on the top marginal tax rate of 46.5c in the dollar, investing in superannuation far outweighs any other form of asset.  Treasury says Australia's overall taxation on savings and investment provides about a third of government income and is among the highest in the developed world.  AUS-20080807-1-004-102912\",\n",
       " \"Business PERSONAL FINANCE Q I took out a reverse mortgage in April 2004 for $40,000. My property was valued at $200,000, interest rate 7.57 per cent. The balance of the loan at the end of 2007 was $51,589. The property is valued at $365,000, interest rate from February 2008 is 9.38 per cent. I am looking to buy a cheaper property, clearing this debt and having some money in the bank. My only option is to buy a park home in a holiday village. My main concern is that the bank will eventually own my home. I am 70, and enjoy good health. Am I worrying unnecessarily?  A If you do the numbers, your position is not nearly as bad as you think and you certainly don't need to sell. There is a strong belief that interest rates are dropping, but even if they don't, your debt should be no more than about $198,000 when you are 85. If your house appreciates at 3 per cent per annum it will be worth $572,000 then.  Q You wrote that a person over 55 could access their super tax-free and gift it to a relative. Is it possible for this to occur without salary sacrificing having been done previously? I would think that the person could still only withdraw their unpreserved super before retirement. If they tried to access preserved super for a deposit it would be taxed highly and have to pass the hardship rule, wouldn't it?  A Once you reach 55, the first $145,000 of your superannuation can be accessed tax-free at age 60 it is all tax-free. However, you cannot access your superannuation as a lump sum at 55 unless you sign a statement that you are permanently retired. You can access it as a transition to retirement pension.  Q A friend with asbestosis has been awarded $117,000, which he has invested in a building society earning interest of $60 a week. He is on the age pension and has no assets. Centrelink has advised they deem the $117,000 at a certain percentage of what he earns and that they will now take $25 a week from his pension plus the $30 interest from the building society.  A If the interest he is receiving is $3000 a year, he is getting less than 4 per cent, which is not good when banks are offering more than 8 per cent. Even if he got just 7.5 per cent he would be receiving interest of $169 a week, which is $109 more than he is getting now. On an investment of $117,000 Centrelink would deem him to be receiving $6232 a year ($120 a week), so as long as he can do better than that he is well in front.

       " \"FINANCE with Paul Clitheroe Super shocker could be just a bump in the road ` Who can forget October 20, 1987 when the All Ordinaries fell by 25 per cent in just one day? ' FINANCE with Paul Clitheroe  ` Who can forget  October 20, 1987  when the All  Ordinaries fell  by 25 per cent  in just one day? '  THIS year's super statements will cause lots of unpleasant surprises, with many discovering for the first time how much sharemarket turbulence can affect their nest egg.  When you review your fund statement for the financial year just ended, chances are you'll find it has gone backwards.  That's because most of us have our super invested in balanced or growth options both of which have strong exposure to the sharemarket.  So when the sharemarket falls, super funds investing in shares are likely to drop.  But here's the thing. The reason investments like shares feature so strongly in super is because they have a track record of solid returns over the long term. And, and as a very long-term asset, your super should also go on to recover from the present turmoil.  To show just how this works, a recent report from fund researcher Morningstar and the Investment and Financial Services Association found if you had invested $1,000 in Australian shares in 1973, the same investment would be worth around $80,000 today. Yet over the intervening 35 years, plenty of events rocked the sharemarket.  In 1974 for example, the OPEC oil crisis sparked a 50 per cent drop in the sharemarket, yet four years later it had recovered its value and continued to climb higher. And who can forget Black Monday October 20, 1987 when the All Ordinaries share index plunged by 25 per cent in just one day? And then there were the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 when Australian shares slid 12 per cent.  The bottom line is history tells us sharemarkets, and your super, should recover their values, and a single year of bad returns will be offset against many more good ones.  Falling super values over this last financial year can mean that those of us nearing retirement may have to rethink our immediate plans, possibly staying at work a bit longer.  Don't get me wrong, I know this will be a setback to many people, and I also don't like seeing my own super heading south.  But if you're still very much in the workforce, now could be a good time to take advantage of discounted asset prices and actually tip more into super. Share values have taken a hammering in the last 12 months and that means your contributions will buy more in terms of underlying investments. By the time you've hung up your workboots it could make a tremendous difference to your lifestyle.

Speaking at launch of Scottish Widows\\' annual report into savings and investments Lib Dem man claims credit crunch may have some benefits  The credit crunch may be the much-needed catalyst that provokes a positive change in British people\\'s attitudes towards saving, Vince Cable has claimed.  Speaking at the launch of the Scottish Widows Savings and Investment Report 2008, the deputy leader and shadow chancellor of the Liberal Democrats, said the current economic turmoil could shock people into saving.  He said: \"There may be an abrupt change in savings behaviour. People have been shocked by the credit crunch and they may overreact and save much more.\"  Mr Cable added tax incentives were not necessarily a good enticement for savers as things such as pension credit could be very complicated.  He said: \"It become much easier to borrow and lenders became very aggressive and people were encouraged to believe in the housing market. Personal debt has achieved levels that are unprecedented and we have an economy that is skewed towards borrowing and the property bubble, which is now bursting. In the future there will be a better balance between savings and borrowing.  \"There needs to be a level playing field with the regulatory framework for savings and borrowing and there needs to be a level playing field between the two.\"  His comments were backed up by the Scottish Widows report, which found that the top financial priority of respondents for the year ahead was paying off debts.  Of the 6000 people surveyed, 35 per cent said their priority for the year was saving. This was followed by 23 per cent who said paying of their mortgage or reducing the mortgage balance topped their list of priorities.  Meanwhile Gordon Greig, head of savings and investments for Scottish Widows, said financial education was needed as an encouragement and called for more simplified products and literature from financial services companies. He added there needed to be incentives especially for those who earn less than GBP20,000.  He told the audience of experts: \"Those who earn less than GBP20,000 have difficulties saving and should be encouraged to save. Child trust funds are an ideal savings vehicle and can provide a great for the next generation of savers.  \"Some savings should be disregarded for the purposes of assessing means tested benefits and the government could consider ring fencing some funds accumulated in an Isa.\"  The 16-page report by the life company concluded savings had fallen out of favour with a lack of funds still proving a barrier. One third of respondents earning more than GBP50,000 a year claimed to be unable to save, while 49 per cent of people earning between GBP20,000 and GBP29,999 also said they could not afford to invest into a savings vehicle.

       " \"5 steps to ease the pain of high fuel costs Prepare for prolonged pain at the pump. The price of gas keeps soaring -- thanks to rising global demand, speculators and the weak dollar. In the past five years, the cost of gas has risen 139 percent, versus 16 percent for the overall cost of living. Here's how to ease the pain:  1. You could trade in your monster SUV. Sales of gas guzzlers have tanked as subcompact sales continue to surge. To see why, just do the math: With gas at $4 a gallon, the annual cost to fill up a new Chevy Tahoe is nearly $3,800, assuming you drive 15,000 miles a year. Switch to a Toyota Prius hybrid and your gas bill drops to $1,300.  2. Or fill up with an alternative fuel. There are affordable substitutes for gasoline-powered vehicles. For example, millions of vehicles are built to run on either gas or E85 (which is 85 percent ethanol). E85 has dropped to $2.50 a gallon, on average, although it may be hard to find outside the Midwest. Fuel-efficient diesel models are on the way, too. For example, the Jetta SportWagon TDI diesel, which debuts in August in the U.S., should cost half as much annually to fuel as the gasoline Jetta, even with diesel above $4 a gallon.  3. Chill behind the wheel. Aggressive driving -- you know, excess speed, frequent lane changing and sharp braking -- cuts fuel economy by as much as 35 percent, according to tests by Edmunds.com. You'll also boost fuel economy by keeping your tires properly inflated. Check to make sure your air filter isn't clogged and remove junk from the trunk.  4. Regular is good enough. A few high-performance engines really do need premium gas to run properly. But chances are that if your owner's manual recommends high octane, your car will do just fine on regular. Most vehicles are equipped with knock sensors, which adjust the engine's timing automatically to prevent uncontrolled sparking of the gasoline-and-air mixture in the cylinders. In exchange for a typical $140 a year in reduced fuel costs, you sacrifice a few horsepower and perhaps a second off your car's zero-to-60 sprint. A few drivers have reported slightly lower fuel economy, too.  5. Stretch your gas money. GasBuddy.com, as well as GasPriceWatch.com, identify the lowest-priced gas in your area. Of course, if you drive out of your way to fill up, you may lose the benefit of the savings. The BP Visa Rewards card earns 5 percent cash back on BP gasoline purchases, 2 percent on travel and dining, and 1 percent on everything else. The Chase PerfectCard MasterCard returns 3 percent on gas purchases and 1 percent on other purchases. Mark Solheim is a senior editor at Kiplinger's Personal Finance magazine.

       " \"Don't be too late FINANCIAL security is the most common factor when it comes to deciding about when to retire, according to research released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the current financial year.  ``But the problem is, without professional retirement planning advice, it's near impossible for most people to know if they're financially secure enough to provide for the retirement they  want,'' says John Newcomb, from RetireInvest Robina.  While their retirement lump sum is likely to be the biggest sum of money they've ever had, and may seem like a fortune, when the impact of tax and inflation is considered - and the fact the money might have to last for a retirement of up to 20 years plus - the amount might not end up stretching far at all.  ``It's important to think in advance about what sort of lifestyle you're expecting in retirement and consider the costs.''  While the government age pension may offer some support, and should be maximised through every reasonable way, it's not something to aspire to of itself.  In the quarter to September, 2007, the cost of living increased to $48,000 a year for retired couples with a lifestyle that included a broad range of leisure activities, private health insurance, a reasonable car, good clothes, and occasional international travel, according to Westpac/Association of Superannuation Funds research.  For those leading a more modest retirement lifestyle, better than the age pension but still fairly basic, the yearly cost was $26,300.  ``With life expectance increasing, it's even more important to ensure your retirement finances are well-planned so you don't outlive your money,'' says John.  When it comes to retiring, there are complex rules around tax, social security, investments and superannuation and  so many ways to structure finances.  ``If Australians only seek financial advice once in their life, planning for retirement is the time to do it and the earlier they seek advice, the more options they'll have,'' says John.  Professional financial advisers can help people identify what sort of retirement lifestyle they want and how to structure their resources to make the most of tax and social security rules and ensure they have a reliable income.  They can provide advice about how and where retirement savings should be put, how to get the most from superannuation and when to retire, as well as how to plan your estate so it's distributed to who you want in the most effective manner.  ``You only have one life so make the most of your retirement with help from a financial adviser,'' says John.

       " \"Consolidation loans - not the easy way out Debt consolidation can seem like an easy way out when the bills get too much. What could be simpler, after all, than rolling all those fiddly direct debits and standing orders into one handy payment each month, so you know exactly how much is going out and on what date?  Debt consolidation can help people to cope with their bills and even avoid going bankrupt. And if repayments on the loan are made promptly each month, a consolidation loan can be used to re-establish a good credit record.  However, debt consolidation loans can be a dangerous. Before you take out a consolidation loan you should understand the difference between secured and unsecured lending and the effect of compound interest  A secured loan, the type usually used for debt consolidation, is one that is linked to your house. The house is the security for the loan so, if you don't make all the repayments, the lender might be able to make you sell your home to pay them back.  This means that a secured loan is riskier for the borrower than an unsecured loan, which is not linked to anything. The worst penalty you face for defaulting on an unsecured loan is to be taken to court. But you should be aware that this might mean in the future you could have trouble getting such things as a credit card, a mortgage or other loan.  Compound interest is interest which is charged on interest that has already been added to a loan. If you do not make your monthly payments in full, you end up paying interest on interest.  How much you pay for a loan in total will be governed by the interest rate and the length of the loan. If you extend the length of your loan, even if the interest rate remains the same as on your previous loans, you will end up paying more back to your lender in the long run.  Debt consolidation loans usually work by bringing your monthly payments down to a level that you feel you can more comfortably afford. But they do this by extending the period of the loan, and making you pay more over the period.  Secured loans are usually offered on a variable rate basis so you could find your repayments soaring if interest rates rise.  So, before you take out a secured loan you should look at other options, including selling valuable items you no longer require, or moving your credit card and store card debt to a card with a lower interest rate.  If you have equity in your home, you could consider remortgaging to release capital as the interest rate on a mortgage tends to be lower than on secured loans.  Remortgaging your house in order to pay off debts does mean that you are securing those debts against your home and as such carries the same risk if you do not keep up the repayments as with a secured loan.\",\n",
       " 'Guardian Financial Pages Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals Abbey today become the first major high street lender to clamp down on low-cost \"interest-only\" mortgages by reducing the maximum loan for such deals to as little as 50% of the property\\'s value.  Growing numbers of borrowers have turned to interest-only loans as a way of affording high property prices. Customers pay interest but none of the capital debt.  In late 2006 the Financial Services Authority warned that thousands of homebuyers taking out these mortgages could be putting themselves at risk of repossession because they have little or no idea how they will pay back the loan.  Abbey said interest-only borrowers with \"a proven repayment vehicle in place\" would be able to borrow up to 75% of a property\\'s value, down from 85%. Those who cannot produce evidence of a repayment vehicle will be limited to 50%. \"This reduces the risk to both the customer and to Abbey, and is prudent given ongoing market conditions,\" a bank spokesman said.  Nationwide yesterday increased the minimum deposit it demands from new borrowers to 10% on all but two of its mortgage products. Britain\\'s biggest building society also halved its maximum loan to pounds 500,000, little more than two weeks after reducing it to pounds 1m.  Nationwide is the latest in a line of banks and building societies to rein in lending in response to the credit crunch. On Saturday Halifax increased some of its fixed and tracker mortgage rates by up to 0.6 of a percentage point.  Nationwide is reducing its maximum loan-to-value ratio from 95% to 90% on all products for new borrowers except its three-year fixed-rate mortgage and three- year tracker, both available to people looking to borrow 95% of a property\\'s value.  Its move will fuel concern that 95% mortgages are under threat; Cheltenham & Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester and Britannia are among other lenders to have capped their maximum loans at 90%.  Halifax is one of the few lenders that still offers mortgages up to 95%, though it charges a higher rate for such loans.  Nationwide also said new customers wanting to take out its standard variable-rate deal, which it calls its \"base mortgage rate\", will need a deposit of at least 25%, and that this deal will be available only to customers dealing directly with it. It described the moves, which take effect from May 1, as \"part of its ongoing approach of managing business in a prudent and sustainable way\".  Sean Gardner, at personal finance website MoneyExpert.com, said the biggest struggle for buyers now was not being able to afford a mortgage but getting one. \"If you\\'ve not got a substantial deposit or equity in your house, then your choices are now severely limited. On average, if you are remortgaging you now need a deposit of 15.5% if you take out a fixed or variable mortgage.\"',\n",

In cases such as yours, a doctor's note confirming you are too ill to travel is usually needed.  But it is not strictly necessary for this letter to be issued at the time you were ill. If your doctor was aware of the illness - perhaps you visited for medication or advice - you could ask the surgery to write a note today.

But if you do switch to a new lender, watch out for stinging legal fees and valuation costs and make sure to avoid deals with early repayment penalties.  As the loan amount is small and you plan to repay the debt as fast as you can, you might find your existing lender's standard variable rate - usually fee-free and penalty-free - works out cheapest, but there is no harm in shopping around.  When comparing deals, think about how quickly you intend to reduce your mortgage. Some lenders offer more flexible provisions for monthly overpayments or lump sum repayments.\",\n",
       " 'No margin for error... OPES Prime investors appear to have a we problem.  Thats the stockbroking firm that went bust recently, owing more than $1 billion.  According to Sunday Times financial columnist Noel Whittaker, Opes clients took out an Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement (AMSLA).  It appears most thought they had regular margin loans, whereby the money borrowed to invest in assets was secured by the underlying investments. If their investments fell below a certain level in value, they would expect a margin call. This would signal they needed to top up their investment, which would remain their property.  But in the case of Opes, ultimately the lender actually owned the shares in this transaction. The purchase confirmation letters to clients, according to Whittaker, read We have bought for you...  In other words, we bought, we own. Or at least the ANZ bank did.  AMSLAs aside, Whittaker still has faith in margin lending, which he calls one of the best wealth-building strategies available.  But the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Australias corporate, markets and financial services regulator, does not share his enthusiasm, noting:  Borrowing money to invest in shares and managed funds using a margin loan is one of the riskiest ways of financing your investments. It can succeed, but understand the risks.  The far shakier Opes with the de rigueur financier running funds in the Caymans and British Virgin Islands still had its champions, including WAs Olympic legend Herb Elliott, who appears to have lost more than $20 million.  The Fortescue Metals Group director was never beaten over a mile, and would probably like to have run a mile from Opes before the wee hit the fan.  We can sympathise to some extent, as human nature dictates that many of us will chase bigger than usual returns, even if they appear unrealistic.  But as Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens has noted of mortgage stress the logic can also be applied to other forms of investing particularly among the wealthier.  As you get more affluent, some of the necessities take up a smaller share of income and some of the things you really want take up a larger share, he said.  For those opting for a more expensive home: That is not stress, per se; that is a choice.  For the western suburbs, the messages are mixed. According to ABN Amro economist Kieran Davies, the prestige end of the property market the $5 million to $20 million bracket is thriving.  But property research group RP Data notes that the top end is likely to come under greater pressure if luxury homes cant be sold, particularly when the owner has a hefty share portfolio coupled with a frightening margin call or two.  It comes back to fundamentals, doesnt it? Allow a margin for error. Perhaps have another look at the fine print in your investment contracts. And if you are going to cut investment corners, look out for increasingly big financial vehicles coming rather rapidly in the opposite direction. Oui?  CWS-20080415-002-102065',\n",
       " \"BUSINESS Women still lack financial self esteem       A NEW report about what Australian women think about money shows a reluctance and low confidence to make investments.        The report, launched by the Financial Literacy Foundation, includes a comprehensive survey of how women describe their abilities, attitudes and behaviour on money issues, such as budgeting, saving, investing and protecting their money.        ``Women are more likely to have time outside the paid workforce and lower incomes, which in the end means less superannuation,'' foundation chairman Paul Clitheroe said.        ``Not only that, women's savings need to go further because they tend to live longer,'' Mr Clitheroe said.        Generally, many women already have good budgeting and saving habits. However, when it comes to investing, planning for the future and retirement -- all things that allow people to take long-term control of their money -- women say they're not confident.        Overall, the survey found:        * More than 70 per cent of women say they're confident with managing money, except for investing (63 per cent), understanding financial language (60 per cent) and ensuring enough money for retirement (60 per cent).        * Women and men have similar day-to-day money habits but women are more likely to regularly budget for day-to-day finances (women 53 per cent, men 44 per cent).        * Women are also more likely to invest in their own home (women 64 per cent, men 60 per cent) but less likely to have other investments.        * More men then women say they understand financial language (women 60 per cent, men 68 per cent) and more men say they can plan for their long-term future than women (women 77 per cent, men 84 per cent).        Importantly, the report found that women want to learn more about managing their money better.        ``I'm pleased to see that investing, planning for the future and retirement are all areas where women are interested in learning more,'' said Mr Clitheroe.        ``And it's not just important for women, I'd encourage everyone to take control of their long-term financial plans, as well as putting themselves in charge of their money day to day,'' he said.        For further information contact the Financial Literacy Foundation. As well as the report there is a series of 14 information sheets to help women improve their money skills.        The information sheets are:1. Your relationship with money.        2. Starting out.        3. Managing on a low income.        4. Money and the single woman.        5. Managing money in your relationship.        6. Having a baby?        7. Teaching your kids about money.        8. Your money is your business.        9. Managing money when your relationship ends.        10. Getting ready for retirement.        11. Managing money when your partner dies.        12. How to get good advice about money.        13.

       " \"City BORROWERS TOLD TO ACT FAST OVER MORTGAGES       Mortgage brokers were today urging homeowners to grab new loan deals now before they are scrapped.        As the flood of mortgages being pulled extended today to competitively priced products from a range of building societies, advisers said customers were having to move quickly before the most attractive deals disappear.        Brokers said they were encouraging customers to buy their products sometimes several months in advance.        Richard Morea of London & Country mortgages said: 'Until recently, the companies would tell us with plenty of notice if they were planning to withdraw a product so we could ring up the client and warn them. Now we don't even get told in advance. It's just gone.'        As many mortgages are guaranteed for up to six months, customers who think rates are going up can reserve a deal now even if their current mortgage deal does not expire until late summer.        Morea said: 'What we're saying is, if you like this offer, grab it now even if you don't need it for a few months.'        In the past two days, more than 570 mortgages have been withdrawn.        Last night saw Nottingham Building Society pull its buy-to-let two and three-year tracker, while the West Bromwich withdrew all its mainstream and buy-to-let mortgages, replacing them with more expensive options.        Darlington Building Society also withdrew its fixed products while Skipton announced plans for a £799 fee to its standard variable rate.        First Direct, the internet and telephone bank owned by    HSBC, this week closed its doors on new mortgages, while Nationwide has jacked up rates for many borrowers, particularly first-time buyers.        Rob Clifford, of broker Mortgage-force, cautioned: 'Can you rely upon a quote from a lender? The answer is no.        'Lenders are not obliged to honour quotes and could elect to reject all applications or offer less attractive deals.        'Consumers haven't got a cast-iron deal unless they have received a formal mortgage offer from the lender.'        The Bank of England yesterday warned that almost half of all lenders will ration mortgages over the next three months.        It recently conceded that two interest rate cuts since December, from 5.75% 5.25%, had done nothing to reduce mortgage costs as banks and building societies put up their own rates. The Bank is under growing pressure to cut rates to 5% next week.        The squeeze on credit by mortgage suppliers - and the prospect of job cuts in the City - is already hitting the housing market. The International Monetary Fund warned British house prices are overvalued by almost 30%.        Default rates on mortgages are expected to rise sharply this year.        Philip Shaw of Investec said: 'The situation has deteriorated further and that's consistent with the news over the past few days that mortgage lenders have been raising their rates and withdrawing products.        'Overall we feel there is a very strong case for rates coming down next week.'\",\n",
       " \"BUSINESS Dividing the spoils       Q&A with accountant Phil Gostin        Q. How do you give your kids money without having to die first?        A. Assuming the parents have assets, and do not have any pension or concessions that could be affected in any way, it is as simple as realising the asset, paying the tax, (if applicable), and straight through to the keeper. But each situation is different.        Q. What are the consequences of giving your kids a deposit for their home or pay their kids school fees?        A. It depends. Firstly, do the parents have the ability to give? Will it impinge on their lifestyle? Will they cope in the event of failing health? The main consequences are effect on pension and tax. But if the parents have a super fund, no Centrelink issues, are retired and aged over 60 their ``drawings'' from funds are tax-free from July 1, 2007. However, if there is a Centrelink consequence, it needs to be looked at to ensure the best outcome.        Q. Is it better to withdraw lump sums from your super?        A. Because the goal posts have shifted, once you are retired and over 60 it's tax free -- whether it's taken as a lump or on the drip, is not the issue. The issue is to make it last, be able to give something to the kids if you can, or leave what remains to them.        Q. What about transferring assets into children's names?        A. The problem is the potential tax implications. Assuming assets were in the parents' name and post 1985, subject to capital gains tax, and if the parents still have significant income in their names, it might not be a good idea. But if the income is a pension from a super fund (self-managed or otherwise), then the tax may not be as significant.        Q. What are tax implications?        A. Tax is tax. Really the cashflow situation is the relevant one. For example, if we do this how much are we going to get? Again, it depends on what assessable income the parents are earning and from where -- ie. Centrelink.        Q. What are the limits or implications of gifting?        A. Gifting is only an issue if you have some aged pension benefit. You can only give $10,000 a year. It is important to note that you can give as much as you want but Centrelink will deem your asset base as dropping only by $10,000 a year. So you can give $100,000 but $90,000 is still included in the asset test when calculating the pension.        Q. Is it wiser to set up a family trust and make distributions that way?        A. The trust arrangement, first and foremost is about asset protection. It can be used for estate planning, but this ought to be done at set-up. What parents sometimes want to do is give the benefit of the investment without losing control of it.        DHS-20080331-1-030-597646\",\n",
       " \"INVESTMENT VIEW: Simple truth       What did the rest of the year have in prospect, mused the chairman of the curiously named Betelgeuse Investment Funds? Private investors had remained cautious after the bumpy end to 2007 and were still dumping equity funds. Property remained in the doldrums and even that recent saviour of fund sales teams - commodity-based products - had had wobbles recently.        He couldn't help but wonder if the fund industry had suffered from a similar degree of over-engineering as the world of banking.        The birth of CDOs, SIVs and, what was that latest acronym he had come across? VIE - that was it - variable interest entities - had contributed to the mayhem that had engulfed the credit market.        At the time, it had looked like a triumph of ingenuity. The rocket scientists of the investment banks had found a means of taking loans off balance sheet, so even more money could be offered to those eager to borrow. True, the collapse of the sub-prime market would always have been a problem. But would it have been as great if the loans had not been packaged up into these financial products and sold on and on and on...        In the investment world, the situation was nothing like as dire, but a degree of complexity had crept in that had not been present even a decade back. The growth of hedge funds and the development of their close cousins - the 130/30 fund - had brought investors into a whole new world.        And then there was the increasing use of derivatives in funds - a comparatively recent option for fund managers.        He mused on the way in which the regulator had reclassified those investment trusts able to gear their portfolios in the wake of the split-capital trust scandal. Just the ability to borrow money against the underlying portfolio to invest in the market was then viewed as an additional risk factor that needed to be declared. Perhaps the ability to hedge through the futures market should be similarly treated.        But the good news was that the industry was in remarkable good health. As always, it was performance that sorted out the men from the boys - that and the increasing tendency for good managers to demand a share of the action when managing money.        Such were the deals available to aspiring Anthony Boltons these days,) it was a wonder that any fund firms made money at all. The chairman returned to the sales figures.        Perhaps simpler was better, he decided. There were funds that had done well and funds that done badly. But the ones at the top of the table were the straightforward offerings that happened to be in the right place at the right time. Nothing really changes, he thought as he headed for the door. There won't be any of those complex products in my pension fund if I have a say in it, was his passing thought.

       "\"News Intervention was the right thing to do FINANCE  The Bank of England's extraordinary intervention in the UK Government bond market was absolutely necessary. Despite representing an embarrassing U-turn on its recently announced plans to sell £80bn of gilts into the markets, its emergency purchases helped restore stability to UK financial markets.  The need for temporary giltbuying was catalysed by problems arising in UK pension funds, which hold hundreds of billions of pounds in UK gilts.  Record low gilt yields in recent years meant government bond prices rose sharply, earning pension funds large profits. However, with global inflation and interest rates rising all over the world, bond yields have risen during 2022, resulting in significant capital losses for pension investors. The money received from past profits helped them manage those losses but in recent days the situation dramatically worsened.  The loss of confidence in sterling through September sparked a rushed exit from UK assets, pushing 30-year gilt yields above 4 per cent. The day after International Monetary Fund warnings about the direction of UK economic policy, international investors accelerated sales or shorting of UK gilts, causing yields to crash through 5 per cent.  The sudden collapse in gilt prices led financial companies to demand more cash collateral to cover pension fund losses. A £1bn pension fund was, perhaps, suddenly facing cash calls of over £100m. Instead of the usual one or two weeks to allow time for orderly sales, they demanded the money in one or two days. This created a negative spiral because pension funds had run out of buffers and faced either selling gilts or other assets into the falling markets or risking default.  The Bank of England's remit to protect financial stability, required it to step in and stop the situation spinning out of control, reducing 30-year yields to 4 per cent.  Pension funds have been stabilised but it is important to stress that final-salary scheme members were not going to lose all their pensions. They are protected by the Pension Protection Fund, which insures 80-90 per cent of their promised pension.  Defined contribution pension scheme members, whose pensions depend on their investments, and do not promise a specific pension, may have been more severely affected. These funds often have significant investments in gilts and bonds, supposedly to reduce risk and provide stability, but rising bond yields have caused large losses. There is no insurance or employer to underpin these pensions and further bond market crises would mean even lower pensions for members.  The Bank of England's intervention is only a temporary measure. More must be done to restore market confidence. If we are to avoid ongoing financial crises, and pension fund damage, Government must restore confidence in UK economic management. This could include lowering taxes on a wider tax base, boosting private investment, or cutting spending, instead of further unfunded tax cuts.  Baroness Ros Altmann is a Tory peer and pensions expert  Government must restore confidence in UK economic management\""
