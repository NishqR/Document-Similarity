0,Intervention was the right thing to do,"News Intervention was the right thing to do FINANCE  The Bank of England's extraordinary intervention in the UK Government bond market was absolutely necessary. Despite representing an embarrassing U-turn on its recently announced plans to sell £80bn of gilts into the markets, its emergency purchases helped restore stability to UK financial markets.  The need for temporary giltbuying was catalysed by problems arising in UK pension funds, which hold hundreds of billions of pounds in UK gilts.  Record low gilt yields in recent years meant government bond prices rose sharply, earning pension funds large profits. However, with global inflation and interest rates rising all over the world, bond yields have risen during 2022, resulting in significant capital losses for pension investors. The money received from past profits helped them manage those losses but in recent days the situation dramatically worsened.  The loss of confidence in sterling through September sparked a rushed exit from UK assets, pushing 30-year gilt yields above 4 per cent. The day after International Monetary Fund warnings about the direction of UK economic policy, international investors accelerated sales or shorting of UK gilts, causing yields to crash through 5 per cent.  The sudden collapse in gilt prices led financial companies to demand more cash collateral to cover pension fund losses. A £1bn pension fund was, perhaps, suddenly facing cash calls of over £100m. Instead of the usual one or two weeks to allow time for orderly sales, they demanded the money in one or two days. This created a negative spiral because pension funds had run out of buffers and faced either selling gilts or other assets into the falling markets or risking default.  The Bank of England's remit to protect financial stability, required it to step in and stop the situation spinning out of control, reducing 30-year yields to 4 per cent.  Pension funds have been stabilised but it is important to stress that final-salary scheme members were not going to lose all their pensions. They are protected by the Pension Protection Fund, which insures 80-90 per cent of their promised pension.  Defined contribution pension scheme members, whose pensions depend on their investments, and do not promise a specific pension, may have been more severely affected. These funds often have significant investments in gilts and bonds, supposedly to reduce risk and provide stability, but rising bond yields have caused large losses. There is no insurance or employer to underpin these pensions and further bond market crises would mean even lower pensions for members.  The Bank of England's intervention is only a temporary measure. More must be done to restore market confidence. If we are to avoid ongoing financial crises, and pension fund damage, Government must restore confidence in UK economic management. This could include lowering taxes on a wider tax base, boosting private investment, or cutting spending, instead of further unfunded tax cuts.  Baroness Ros Altmann is a Tory peer and pensions expert  Government must restore confidence in UK economic management",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0
10,Drivers face £35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue,"News Drivers face £35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue * Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police  * But at present drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty nor vehicle excise duty  * Government urged to have a 'conversation' with drivers on new ways to be taxed  * The report recommends 'road pricing' which would charge drivers per car trip  Drivers will have to pay new taxes to plug the £35billion shortfall created by the switch to electric cars - and ministers must spell out what they are, a report says today.  The Commons transport committee's report urges the Government to start an 'up-front conversation' with drivers about new ways they could be taxed.  At present, drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty, which nets £28billion a year, or vehicle excise duty, which brings in £7billion.  Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police.  Vehicle excise duty is spent fixing roads. To replace them, the report recommends 'road pricing', which would charge drivers per trip, based on the distance travelled, duration of the journey and vehicle type.  It also urges ministers to set up an arms-length body to recommend a new regime by the end of this year.  The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030, so millions of motorists are expected to go electric before then.  A government spokesman said it was committed to keeping the transition to electric cars 'affordable for consumers'.  Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show plug-in vehicles accounted for more than one in six new cars registered in the UK last year.  'The situation is urgent,' the report warned. 'Work must begin without delay.'  Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said the UK faces a '£35 billion black hole in finances unless the Government acts now'.  He went on: 'That's 4% of the entire tax-take. Only £7 billion of this goes back to the roads; schools and hospitals could be impacted if motorists don't continue to pay.  'We need to talk about road pricing.  'Innovative technology could deliver a national road pricing scheme which prices up a journey based on the amount of road, and type of vehicle, used.'  He added: 'Net-zero emissions should not mean zero tax revenue.'  RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the 'silver lining of zero-carbon motoring comes wrapped in a cloud of trouble for the Chancellor'.  He went on: 'Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next - particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change.  'If the Treasury is thinking it can leave this issue for another day but still recoup their losses from electric vehicles they risk a furious backlash from drivers who made the choice to go electric expecting to save money.'",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0

Price Advantage gives exclusive discounts to Boots customers with an Advantage card in over 2,000 stores across the UK.  Shoppers have to hand over their Advantage Card at the tills to get the lower price that is advertised on the shelves.  Customers will know if an item is included in the Price Advantage as they'll be advertised with a pink sticker in stores.  The pink stickers will show the price for Advantage Card holders and the price for other shoppers.  Price Advantage isn't available on the Boots website and shoppers without an Advantage Card won't be able to get the lower prices.  Boots says shoppers will see discounts on around 150 products each month.  This month, customers can save over £8 on the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser Pure Retinol Deep Anti-Wrinkle Night Serum which costs £16.60 for Advantage Card holders, compared to £24.99 for regular customers.

Make sure you compare prices online using websites such as Price Spy and CamelCamelCamel to check you're getting the best deal.  Always go for the lowest price to make the biggest saving.  What is an Advantage Card  It is free to sign up for an Advantage Card -you can do this on the Boots website -and the scheme allows you to accrue points as you shop.  Advantage Card holders get four points for every £1 spent -and points are worth 1p each in return.  This means if you collect 100 points, you'd have £1 to spend, while 1,000 points are worth £10.  You can also get personalised discounts sent to you by Boots by being an Advantage Card holder.  A spokesperson from Boots said: ""Helping shoppers get more out of life for less, all Boots Advantage Card holders will be given access to the Price Advantage programme meaning they'll be able to get their hands on even bigger savings by being members of the loyalty scheme.""

This is because you could be deemed to be driving a car in a dangerous condition, if broken or blunt wiper blades stop you from clearing your windscreen properly.  If your wiper blades aren't working, then your visibility of the road could be affected while you're driving.  As well as risking a £2,500 fine, you could also see three points added to your driving licence, according to National Tyres and Autocare.  If the offence is committed within three years of a previous conviction for a similar offence, then you could be disqualified from driving for a minimum of six years.  Failure to have proper control of a vehicle or full view of the road and traffic ahead also carries a fine of £1,000 -or £2,500 for passenger-carrying or goods vehicles.  Section 40a of The Road Traffic Act: Using a Vehicle in a Dangerous Condition Part II, states that: ""A person is guilty of an offence if he uses, or causes or permits another to use, a motor vehicle or trailer on a road when the condition of the motor vehicle or trailer, or of its accessories or equipment is such that the use of the motor vehicle or trailer involves a danger of injury to any person.""  Michael Bourne, Group Marketing Director of National Tyres commented: ""Windscreen wipers are pivotal to safety and being able to see those around you, yet there are so many people unaware of how important it is to keep them in the best possible condition.  ""The last thing a driver wants is to realise their visibility is compromised by defective windscreen wipers when they're travelling at speed or when the weather suddenly turns bad.  ""With winter just around the corner, it's important that motorists are mindful of their own safety and the condition of their vehicle is of paramount importance to other road users.""  Have you successfully appealed a driving fine Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  How to check your wiper blades  Your car can fail its MOT if your windscreen wipers don't work properly or they don't clear your windscreen effectively.  National Tyres and Autocare has provided the following tips to check yours are in working order:  * Check your wipers don't leave streaks and smears behind when they remove rain, debris, or dirt.  * Check if the rubber on your wipers is cracked or split in any way.  * Make sure your wipers are not bouncing off your screen rather than smoothly gliding across the surface of the glass.",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

Bob Menendez issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate's housing subcommittee, today spoke on the Senate floor to warn his colleagues of a looming foreclosure and eviction crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout if Congress fails to act.  ""[A]n impending storm ... is brewing and headed our way. It will bring with it enormous financial pain. It will threaten public safety. It will make fighting the pandemic that much harder. And it will set back our nation's economic recovery,"" said Sen. Menendez. ""If the Senate fails to respond to this looming crisis, Americans will needlessly suffer, families will be displaced, personal fortunes will be wiped out, and the scars will run so deep, it could take decades to heal the wounds.""  Sen. Menendez urged his colleagues to pass four separate pieces of legislation aimed at stabilizing the housing market and ensuring residents can remain safe and secure in their homes.  This week, he introduced the Coronavirus Housing Counseling Improvement Act (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/search?q=housing+counseling&access=p&as_dt=i&as_epq=&as_eq=&as_lq=&as_occt=any&as_oq=&as_q=&as_sitesearch=&client=wyden&sntsp=0&filter=0&getfields=&lr=&num=15&numgm=3&oe=UTF8&output=xml_no_dtd&partialfields=&proxycustom=&proxyreload=0&proxystylesheet=default_frontend&requiredfields=&sitesearch=&sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&start=0&ud=1) to expand access to critical information, assistance programs and services for millions of families struggling to remain in their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout. According to research, homeowners who receive counseling have a better chance at avoiding default, protecting their credit scores, reducing debt and securing mortgage modifications.  Sen. Menendez announced that he will introduce a separate bill, the Emergency Housing Assistance for Older Adults Act, which would provide $1.2 billion for two key HUD housing assistance programs in order to ensure that federally-assisted senior housing facilities have the necessary resources to effectively protect residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The senator has cosponsored the Housing Assistance Fund (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-will-introduce-bill-to-create-new-75b-housing-assistance-fund-to-keep-nj-families-in-their-homes) to provide $75 billion in targeted assistance to keep people in their homes while they search for new employment or wait to get back to work by helping residents pay the mortgage, utilities, and support to prevent eviction, delinquency or foreclosure. He is also an original cosponsor of the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, which would provide $100 billion to help families pay rent and help property owners maintain safe and healthy housing.

52,Getting a loan is all about risk,"Getting a loan is all about risk IF YOU are thinking about applying for a home loan, it's important to gain an understanding of what the banks and lenders look for in the approval process.  The lender will assess your financial position and ability to service the loan, and based on the level of risk that you impose on them, will make a decision on how much or how little they are prepared to lend you, says Loan Market.  Let's look at some of the important key measures used by lenders to help assess your risk.  Income  Your current income will be used to determine the amount of money you can borrow.  Earning a higher income could suggest that you are able to better service your home loan.  But it's not just about what you earn - the lender will also look at your employment history and tenure.  In addition, they will assess your employment status (i.e. full-time, part-time, casual, permanent) to better understand your position.  In the case of self-employed applicants, the process may require more work and further lender scrutiny as the risk is usually higher.  Credit history  Your credit history gives the lender an indication of how you conduct your debts.  Having a clean credit history can increase your chances of borrowing a higher amount because it demonstrates that you are a responsible borrower.  You can request a copy of your credit file to ensure there isn't a black mark against your name.  The last thing you want is to be knocked back by your lender because of a telco default you incurred a few years ago.  In Australia, you can obtain your credit report from VEDA for free.  Deposit amount  The larger the amount you have for a deposit, the less risk the lender is taking when lending to you.  Having regular and consistent deposits made into your bank account will show the lender your ability to save despite having other current expenses.  Debts  Having debts can also determine your borrowing eligibility.  If you have any outstanding debts such as credit cards or personal loans, it would be beneficial to have them paid off before applying for a home loan.  If you have multiple debts, combining them into one could also help to reduce your repayments, which will look more favourable to the lender.  The lender will assess how much money you have left over (after paying your debts) and determine whether you will still be able to afford paying a mortgage.  A mortgage broker plays a key role when you're looking for home loan approval.  You can speak to them about the best way to position yourself to maximise your chances of having your home loan approved.  If you're looking to roll your debts into one, a mortgage broker can talk to you about your options when it comes to a consolidation loan.  This can not only reduce your monthly repayments but can also get you a lower interest rate.",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
61,"Residential Customers Seeing Lower Electric Bills Thanks to NatGas, EIA Says","Residential Customers Seeing Lower Electric Bills Thanks to NatGas, EIA Says Besides helping to lower carbon emissions, the continued growth of cheap natural gas-fired power generation in the United States in 2016 seems to be lowering residential electric bills as well.  Based on data collected through the first half of 2016, U.S. residential electricity prices are trending down for the first time in over a decade, according to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) ""Today in Energy"" note published Thursday.  Through six months ""residential customers paid on average 12.4 cents/kWh, or 0.7% lower than the same period last year,"" EIA wrote. ""If this trend continues for the rest of 2016, annual average residential electricity prices would decline for the first time since 2002. Over the past five years, nominal residential prices have increased an average of 1.9% annually, about the same rate as overall inflation.""  Residential ratepayers ""in most areas of the country are seeing lower retail electricity prices this year compared with the same time last year,"" and the availability of cheap natural gas has been one of the main catalysts, EIA said. ""Over the first six months of 2016, the weighted average cost of natural gas delivered to electricity generators was $2.58/MMBtu, 28% lower than the first half of 2015.""  The New England region, coming off higher retail and wholesale power prices between 2013 and 2014, has seen residential prices fall by 6% through the first six months of 2016, averaging around 19.2 cents/kWh, EIA said. ""Improved supplies of natural gas into the region, along with lower natural gas prices, have contributed to the region's declining retail electricity rates so far in 2016.""  Noting a recent uptick in natural gas prices, EIA said its latest projections expect the average delivered cost of natural gas to be 27% higher in 2H2016 compared to 1H2016, with prices continuing to trend upward in 2017. Consequently, U.S. residential electricity prices are also expected to increase in 2017 by 3%, EIA said.  ""Not all recent declines in electricity prices can be attributed to developments in natural gas markets,"" EIA said. Hawaii, for example, uses petroleum in a number of its generating units, ""and the falling cost of crude oil has contributed to a 12% decline in retail electricity prices so far in 2016.""  After natural gas overtook coal's monthly share of U.S. electric generation for the first time in decades in 2015, power sector demand for gas has continued to increase in 2016 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 2).  The increased role of gas in the power stack has helped drive down greenhouse gas emissions, with U.S. carbon dioxide emissions falling below 2005 levels last year (see Daily GPI, May 9).  Even President Obama on Monday defended the role natural gas and unconventional shale development have played in addressing climate change (see Daily GPI, Oct. 4).

67,Health Care on a Budget,"UpFront Health Care on a Budget The impact medical costs will have in retirement.  ""We talk about all aspects of what participants will need in retirement,"" says Michael Woomer, senior vice president of institutional and retirement plan services at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""People basically understand they will be facing health care costs, but they don't understand how big the impact will be, so we tell participants how important it is to save as much as they can.""  A recent report from the National Association of Government Defined Contribution (DC) Administrators estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring today should expect to spend $220,000 on health care over the course of a 20-year retirement. Woomer says the costs could range from $150,000 to $400,000.  It is far more important for plan advisers to discuss health care costs in retirement than it is to talk about lifestyle goals, says Mary McDougall, a Merrill Lynch financial adviser in St. Paul, Minnesota. The premiums and out-of-pocket expenses will range from $10,000 to $20,000 a year, she says. ""The expenses are a lot more than they expect.""  ""I would hope that advisers are not refraining from having this conversation,"" says Scott Laue, a financial adviser with Savant Capital Management in Rockford, Illinois. ""As a certified financial planner [CFP], we are required to disclose both the good and the bad.""  The trend toward high-deductible health care plans paired with health savings accounts (HSAs) is bringing the subject of health care costs-pre- and post-retirement-to the fore, says Shelby George, vice president, adviser services, at Manning & Napier in Rochester, New York. Just like the movement from pensions to defined contribution plans, employers are moving toward high-deductible plans, which put more of the onus on participants, and ""are encouraging advisers to talk about [those coming expenses] more in their education materials.""  Advisers are also increasingly encouraging participants to invest in HSAs. ""This is one area that participants can use to save above and beyond the retirement plan,"" Woomer says.  Even for participants with more than $5 million in liquid assets-the market advised by Frank Migliazzo, managing director, private wealth advisers at Merrill Lynch in Troy, Michigan-health care costs are a concern. Migliazzo notes that Merrill Lynch research has found that, over the last 30 years, health care costs have risen an average of 6 percentage points above inflation each year.  Merrill Lynch has also found that many people will end up in a nursing home, he adds. For 65-year-olds, there is a 15% chance they will need to be placed in a care facility. At age 85, that possibility rises to 55%, and at age 90, it increases to 70%. Migliazzo's clients are also worried about dementia. As a result, many are buying long-term-care insurance.  The report found that Medicare covers 62% of health care costs, but the individual is responsible for the remaining 38%.",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
76,New house sales build,"Property New house sales build Signs of growth in new housing sales have emerged in NSW and Western Australia, the states with the biggest house price gains.  Nationally, new housing sales rose 3.4 per cent after a 4.7 per cent decrease in July, the Housing Industry Association's seasonally adjusted figures, released on Tuesday, show.  However, new apartment sales fell 11.2 per cent across the country after new units sales eased in NSW and Victoria.  ""It is no coincidence that the states where we've seen rises in new detached house sales are where we've seen the most price growth,"" HIA chief economist Harley Dale said.  New home sales were up 10.2 per cent in August for Western Australia and 7.4 per cent in NSW. South Australia also performed strongly, recording an 8.2 per cent increase.  Dr Dale said recovery was under way in those two states but overall sales were trending sideways when Sydney and Perth were not included in the figures.  In Queensland, where new house sales inched up at 3.6 per cent, a housing recovery will not be as rapid.  ""It will be challenging and take time to gather momentum; it will be a grinding recovery in Queensland,"" he said.  In Victoria, new house sales fell 2.4 per cent.  Dr Dale said he expected further declines this financial year, as the state was still coming off peak growth in new home and apartment sales in 2010.  Improvements in Sydney have been seen in the housing and apartment market. However, there were fewer new unit sales in August.  Across the industry, builders and developers have noted an overall improvement in sentiment and inquiry levels.  Home builder Metricon chief executive Mario Biasin said sales had improved in NSW, Queensland and South Australia but off very low bases.High demand expected to continue  He said regional Victoria was performing well but metropolitan Melbourne remained quiet.  ""We're seeing more investors than first-home buyers at the moment, and people wanting to upgrade. More people are building now that they feel confident in selling their existing home,"" he said.  Years of under-supply in Sydney's land market, coupled with strong population growth and low interest rates, are fuelling the market.  Cameron Holt, chief executive of Investa's house and land arm, said the biggest challenge was maintaining the supply to the hungry Sydney market.  The unlisted land development arm of Investa Property Group has reported an increase in demand, particularly on Sydney's fringe.  Mr Holt said demand had been high over the past six months, and he expected that to continue.  Medium and high-density projects continue to sell strongly in Sydney, such as Australand's Metro project at Wolli Creek, where 55 of the 70 apartments sold at the September launch.  CBA economists said while low interest rates are not showing up in retail trade data, the housing figures suggest lower rates are having a significant effect on the housing market.",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0
81,A fund of one,"A fund of one How one US pension plan is revising the definition of a 'commingled' fund to speed up investment  Finding ways of investing faster appears to be rife among US pension plans at the minute. Note last month's procedural shift by the Nebraska Investment Council, which removed the need for board approval for certain repeat commitments. The reasoning for the expedited process was to better enable the pension system to invest in vehicles prior to the first close, when better fees and terms are sometimes offered. If you ever wanted an indicator of how hot the US real estate market has become, measures likes these are surely one.  In addition, since the Nebraska case came to light, another one has cropped up. As PERE reported this week, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) has made a $100 million commitment to CityView Bay Area II.  This might seem like a run-of-the-mill commitment to a commingled fund. Indeed, that is what LACERA calls it. However, upon closer inspection, it much more closely resembles a separate account. There is only one limited partner, LACERA, and the pension plan has complete control over areas such as general partner termination, fund extensions and cessation of investment period. It also has retained the right to own the projects outright upon completion as long-term core assets and already has drawn up a true separate account management agreement with CityView to be used if and when it acquires full interests.  So, why hasn't LACERA just committed to a separate account rather than what it technically defines as commingled fund? The answer is the need for speed.  If LACERA had made this commitment as a separate account, it would first have had to go through a time-consuming request for proposal (RFP) process that typically requires six to nine months to complete. However, it doesn't want to miss out on opportunities now.  Still, there is no 'legal' definition for what constitutes a commingled fund. In addition, unlike some investors, LACERA does not have a limit on the percentage of a commingled fund that its investment can represent.  It's also important to note that not all state pension plans are subject to RFP processes for separate account managers or other real estate hires One large public pension that PERE spoke with has made its multiple separate account manager hires without putting mandates out for public bid. For LACERA, the need to engage in an RFP process becomes an additional hurdle and potentially puts it at a competitive disadvantage. This unique fund structure is one way for the pension plan to level the playing field without breaking the rules.  Of course, not all pension funds in the US will be following suit in finding ways to expedite the investment process. However, with the US market appearing so hot right now and investors not wishing to be too late to opportunities, one can expect more pension plans to find ways to be more nimble.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0

""Our goal is to help the state save time and operate efficiently, while delivering exceptional service and secure online account access for COBRA participants.

Outsourcing benefit management is becoming more common, said Jan White, president of the Society for Human Resource Management of Greater Kansas City. White also is HR director for the Visiting Nurse Association of Kansas City. ""COBRA is just one of those regulations that a lot of people find cumbersome to manage, and if you can outsource it, that frees you up for other tasks,"" White said in the September 7 edition of the Kansas City Business Journal.  ""Public and private organizations understand that it's inefficient to continuously invest in the training, legal review and documentation needed to properly administer COBRA,"" Meyers said. ""It's considerably more cost-effective to outsource COBRA administration to experts -- particularly now that we're operating in the age of health care reform with a constantly evolving landscape.""

85,"California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform","News; News California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a hotly contested pension reform bill whose impact on public employees may signal a new era in DB and health care coverage nationwide.  Reuters notes that Brown's new legislation will raise the minimum retirement ages for many public employees as well as reducing pension benefits for all new workers.  ""Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system,"" Brown said, in a statement. The law, he adds, is the ""biggest rollback to public pensions in the history of California pensions.""  California's new rules come admit tremendous economic and political pressure to curtail the escalating costs of DB plans and post-retirement benefits for public employees, both in that state and across the U.S.  But California's pressures have been stronger, with several major cities claiming or teetering on the verge of bankrupcy as they find it impossible to meet their pension obligations, in part due to long-term national economic issues.  The state's two biggest pension funds, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, are at least $165 million underfunded.  And normally left-leaning, worker-friendly cities including San Jose and San Diego have also joined the fray, with voters supporting measures to limit pension benefits for existing workers and retirees and drastically reduce services to new hires - votes which are being contested in court by public safety employee unions.  Under Brown's new legistlation, new hires will evenly split payments to their pension accounts with their employers, and other government employers will have more leverage to ask the same of current employees, upping their required contributions. Park rangers, game wardens and firefighters will now have to pay more of their own benefits.  The legislation also launches new formulas for calculating future pension benefits for new employees.  As a spin-off to the pension legislation, Moody's Investors Service said the action will go far to increasing California's overall credit rating, currently listed as A1.  The Associated Press notes that the bill did not include a hybrid-styled system Brown had championed which would add a 401(k)-style system so public employees would bear some of the investment risk, as private-sector workers do.  As well, nothing was done to contain the health care costs promised to retiring workers, and there are still no indendent members with financial experties on the board of the state's main pension fund.  ""Yes, it's not everything. It's not perfection,"" Brown told reporters in Los Angeles. ""But in politics we don't deal with perfection. These are hard fought. These aren't that easy.""  California's public employees' system estimates the changes will save between $42 billion and $50 billion over 30 years, while the teachers' system estimated its savings at $22.7 billion over 30 years.",1,0.0,1.0,0.0,0
89,"New Book by Chicago Tax and Estate Planning Attorneys Reveals Disastrous Tax Pitfalls ; Cut Your Tax in 2010, by Anthony Perrelli and Dean...","New Book by Chicago Tax and Estate Planning Attorneys Reveals Disastrous Tax Pitfalls ; Cut Your Tax in 2010, by Anthony Perrelli and Dean Hedeker, Exposes How Poor Tax and Estate Planning Forces Many of Us to Pay Thousands More Than the Law Requires LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - Cut Your Tax in 2010 (And Preserve Your Legacy) is released to major booksellers this week byNew Year Publishing. Cut Your Tax in 2010 (ISBN 978-1-9355470-5-1) provides the straight talk on how poor tax and retirement planning can cost your family dearly. The book is written by Chicago-area tax and estate planning attorneys Anthony R. Perrelli and Dean R. Hedeker.  ""Cut Your Tax in 2010 isn't about cheating the system,"" explains Perrelli. ""It's about avoiding mistakes on big taxes like estate and capital gains. Legacies are being lost by the second or third generation for no good reason.""  Cut Your Tax in 2010 covers how:  Personal and business assets can be protected in four smart steps. Capital gains taxes can ruin a family's legacy. An estate plan can save your family more than taxes.  ""Those working towards retirement have the most to gain with these insights,"" explains Hedeker. ""The book offers a way to start a dialogue between your own parents, spouse, and children - so that you can begin to work together to secure your family's financial future.""  The book tackles the current estate tax debacle in Congress as a major hot button for 2010. Hedeker and Perrelli point out that those with a decent amount of assets built up need to understand that:  The estate tax is currently scheduled to reappear in 2011, at only a $1 million exemption. Estates that escape a federal estate tax in 2010 may cause inheritors other tax headaches, particularly in capital gains taxes. Most states have their own estate or inheritance taxes. Illinois' estate tax kicks in at $2 million and that won't be changing anytime soon.  ""People thought that no estate tax in 2010 would make this the 'year to die,'"" says Perrelli. ""But it can be a nightmare because estates less than $3.5 million are now subjected to capital gains taxes instead.""  Cut Your Tax in 2010 is available atAmazon.comand other major booksellers.

91,Cloud of debt lifted through financial coaching program,"Cloud of debt lifted through financial coaching program Maggie San Miguel spent years living in fear.  The 47-year-old Austin woman couldn't answer the telephone. She refused to open her mailbox. She couldn't deal with the debt collectors constantly hounding her for the tens of thousands of dollars in debt she had accumulated. So she just ignored them.  She couldn't sleep. She drank to forget everything, she said.  ""Eventually you're just frozen,"" San Miguel said. ""It gets worse and worse and worse. You're just running all the time.""  Then 18 months ago , San Miguel connected with Foundation Communities. She learned how to get her finances under control.  ""It's so freeing,"" she said. ""I've never experience such empowerment. It's amazing.""  Foundation Communities is an Austin-based nonprofit well known for renting affordable apartments and duplexes across the city. Its community tax centers, which provide tax preparation services for low-income people and facilitated $25 million in tax refunds last year, also gets the spotlight. The tax center program is available to individuals making less than $25,000 annually and families earning less than $50,000 per year. Those centers are currently open, and more information is available at www.foundcom.org .  What's less known is the nonprofit's financial coaching programs, which teach people how to set a budget, save money, reduce debt and repair credit. For some people, that coaching is the first time they've ever been taught how to manage their finances, said Katie Hazekamp , a community outreach associate for Foundation Communities.  ""We don't have any financial information incorporated into our education and then we're just supposed to know how to do it,"" she said.  San Miguel did know how to do it. She'd worked in accounting and business for years, she said. But after a five divorces and a bout with breast cancer, San Miguel, who has one son, found herself deeply in debt.  Even though she was working, she couldn't pay off her bills, she said. She didn't know that she could negotiate with creditors or that she should scour her credit report for possible mistakes.  Instead, overwhelmed, she ignored everything. She avoided her mailbox for weeks to avoid the threatening letters.  ""Sometimes, the mailman would leave notes in my mailbox saying, 'You know. . . ,' "" San Miguel said.  In 2008 , while looking for a new place to live, she stumbled across several South Austin duplexes owned by Foundation Communities. She got financial coaching and learned how to attack her debt. And she realized that fear had been her biggest barrier to financial recovery.  Now, San Miguel said, she is paying her bills on time and working with her creditors to pay off her bills. She's learning about financial programs that could allow her to eventually buy her own home.  She answers her phone. She opens her mailbox.  ""It's monumental,"" she said. ""My life is so different.""  aball@statesman.com; 912-2506",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
93,8. Pay down debt,"Guardian Money Pages 8. Pay down debt This, claims Jill Insley, is going to be the year when I practise what I invariably preach and actually do something about paying off all my unsecured debt.  I was good at keeping my bank account in the black until I had a baby - then it all went pear-shaped. Even before she was born, my daughter was good at getting me to spend money on her . . . and it's never really stopped.  Two years on, I became a single parent, and like many people who split up with their partners, I didn't cut back enough on our lifestyle-spending to fit my new budget. I gradually built up debt on a credit card, then on a second one, and my bank account has been constantly overdrawn.  Last year I paid off one credit card. But I have another to go, plus the overdraft. By the start of 2011 I want to have just one credit card that I can pay off in full every month (if I have used it), and no overdraft.  * Action plan  Switch cards to make sure you pay little or no interest on credit balances. According to the credit card tables on www.guardian.co.uk/money, the best balance transfer deal is now offered by Virgin: it charges 2.98% for transferring your balance, then 0% for 16 months. Just be aware that the card is run by MBNA and your application will be rejected if you already have a card with that company - as well as leaving a footprint on your credit record.  With interest rates so low on mortgage debt, now is a good time to use any surplus to pay down more costly unsecured debt. Overdrafts are obviously more expensive than 0% credit cards, so it makes more sense paying the minimum on the credit card until the overdraft has gone.  Close down any dormant savings accounts with odd bits of money in and pay the cash into the overdrawn current account.  Likewise, liquidate any non-performing investments. Better that they save you the interest you would otherwise be paying than sit in the hands of a hapless investment manager doing nothing.  Sell unwanted toys/books/bikes/coffee makers on eBay or at your local car boot sale.  Look for other savings by: switching broadband and landline suppliers (www.guardiandigitalcomparison.co.uk suggests a bundle provided by Orange for pounds 10 a month, with 20Mb broadband, unlimited download and free evening and weekend calls); switch gas and electricity deals (www.energyhelpline.com says Npower's Sign On-Line could take pounds 172 a year off my British Gas tariff, while Ovo New Energy, a newish utility provider, will only save pounds 144 but may be a better bet service-wise).  Leave the plastic perisher at home, ask for your credit limit to be reduced each time you pay back pounds 1,000 to eliminate the temptation of spending - and cut it up once it's paid off.",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,1

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 3 points at 10549. The S&P 500 climbed fractionally to finish the day at 1126, and the Nasdaq edged up 3 to 2291.The stagnation occurred despite a pop in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which rose to 60 this month, up from 56.1 in November. Expectations were for a nudge down to 55.1. A reading over 50 indicates growth.  In Washington, the government appears close to giving GMAC Financial Services another $3.5 billion in aid, in addition to the $12.5 its already put in since December 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing an anonymous source.  Meanwhile, airlines and stocks overseas were hit hard early on concerns that Japanese Airlines' restructuring will involve bankruptcy.  The airline sector also faced more security worries, as President Obama said Wednesday that a ""systemic failure"" had occurred in the handling of information that could have prevented a Christmas Day terrorism attempt on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. OSI Systems, which makes security equipment for airlines, jumped more than 9%.  Most of the airlines rallied in afternoon trading and finished in the black.  Stocks overseas were higher. In Europe, the FTSE in London and Dax in Frankfurt were adding 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively. In Asia, the Nikkei in Japan was closed for the session while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.09%. Commodities were mixed, with crude oil gaining 87 cents to $79.74 a barrel and gold falling $4.60 to $1,093.50 an ounce while the dollar gained strength.  U.S. crude stockpiles fell by less than expected last week, while gasoline inventories saw a surprise decline, the Department of Energy said Wednesday. Crude inventories fell by 1.54 million barrels, fewer than the 1.74 million expected. Gasoline inventories fell unexpectedly by 366,000 barrels.

97,Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals,"Guardian Financial Pages Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals Abbey today become the first major high street lender to clamp down on low-cost ""interest-only"" mortgages by reducing the maximum loan for such deals to as little as 50% of the property's value.  Growing numbers of borrowers have turned to interest-only loans as a way of affording high property prices. Customers pay interest but none of the capital debt.  In late 2006 the Financial Services Authority warned that thousands of homebuyers taking out these mortgages could be putting themselves at risk of repossession because they have little or no idea how they will pay back the loan.  Abbey said interest-only borrowers with ""a proven repayment vehicle in place"" would be able to borrow up to 75% of a property's value, down from 85%. Those who cannot produce evidence of a repayment vehicle will be limited to 50%. ""This reduces the risk to both the customer and to Abbey, and is prudent given ongoing market conditions,"" a bank spokesman said.  Nationwide yesterday increased the minimum deposit it demands from new borrowers to 10% on all but two of its mortgage products. Britain's biggest building society also halved its maximum loan to pounds 500,000, little more than two weeks after reducing it to pounds 1m.  Nationwide is the latest in a line of banks and building societies to rein in lending in response to the credit crunch. On Saturday Halifax increased some of its fixed and tracker mortgage rates by up to 0.6 of a percentage point.  Nationwide is reducing its maximum loan-to-value ratio from 95% to 90% on all products for new borrowers except its three-year fixed-rate mortgage and three- year tracker, both available to people looking to borrow 95% of a property's value.  Its move will fuel concern that 95% mortgages are under threat; Cheltenham & Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester and Britannia are among other lenders to have capped their maximum loans at 90%.  Halifax is one of the few lenders that still offers mortgages up to 95%, though it charges a higher rate for such loans.  Nationwide also said new customers wanting to take out its standard variable-rate deal, which it calls its ""base mortgage rate"", will need a deposit of at least 25%, and that this deal will be available only to customers dealing directly with it. It described the moves, which take effect from May 1, as ""part of its ongoing approach of managing business in a prudent and sustainable way"".  Sean Gardner, at personal finance website MoneyExpert.com, said the biggest struggle for buyers now was not being able to afford a mortgage but getting one. ""If you've not got a substantial deposit or equity in your house, then your choices are now severely limited. On average, if you are remortgaging you now need a deposit of 15.5% if you take out a fixed or variable mortgage.""",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0

G. writes: My wife and I had to cancel our holiday as I fell ill just before we were due to go. Our travel insurer refuses to pay compensation as I cannot provide a doctor's note. Is there anything we can do?  P. D. replies: All travel insurance policies require you to provide satisfactory evidence in support of a claim. In cases such as yours, a doctor's note confirming you are too ill to travel is usually needed.  But it is not strictly necessary for this letter to be issued at the time you were ill. If your doctor was aware of the illness - perhaps you visited for medication or advice - you could ask the surgery to write a note today. This should refer to the original illness and state that you were unfit to travel.  Most insurers will consider your claim, even if the letter is written after the event.  But in the absence of a doctor's note, I am afraid you will not be able to claim.  T. K. writes: My mortgage deal ends next month and I will still owe £18,000, which I want to pay off as soon as possible.  The new mortgage deals from my existing provider look uncompetitive. Should I look elsewhere?  R. C. replies: Yes. Even though you want only an £18,000 mortgage, most lenders will consider this.  But if you do switch to a new lender, watch out for stinging legal fees and valuation costs and make sure to avoid deals with early repayment penalties.  As the loan amount is small and you plan to repay the debt as fast as you can, you might find your existing lender's standard variable rate - usually fee-free and penalty-free - works out cheapest, but there is no harm in shopping around.  When comparing deals, think about how quickly you intend to reduce your mortgage. Some lenders offer more flexible provisions for monthly overpayments or lump sum repayments.",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0
100,Women still lack financial self esteem,"BUSINESS Women still lack financial self esteem       A NEW report about what Australian women think about money shows a reluctance and low confidence to make investments.        The report, launched by the Financial Literacy Foundation, includes a comprehensive survey of how women describe their abilities, attitudes and behaviour on money issues, such as budgeting, saving, investing and protecting their money.        ``Women are more likely to have time outside the paid workforce and lower incomes, which in the end means less superannuation,'' foundation chairman Paul Clitheroe said.        ``Not only that, women's savings need to go further because they tend to live longer,'' Mr Clitheroe said.        Generally, many women already have good budgeting and saving habits. However, when it comes to investing, planning for the future and retirement -- all things that allow people to take long-term control of their money -- women say they're not confident.        Overall, the survey found:        * More than 70 per cent of women say they're confident with managing money, except for investing (63 per cent), understanding financial language (60 per cent) and ensuring enough money for retirement (60 per cent).        * Women and men have similar day-to-day money habits but women are more likely to regularly budget for day-to-day finances (women 53 per cent, men 44 per cent).        * Women are also more likely to invest in their own home (women 64 per cent, men 60 per cent) but less likely to have other investments.        * More men then women say they understand financial language (women 60 per cent, men 68 per cent) and more men say they can plan for their long-term future than women (women 77 per cent, men 84 per cent).        Importantly, the report found that women want to learn more about managing their money better.        ``I'm pleased to see that investing, planning for the future and retirement are all areas where women are interested in learning more,'' said Mr Clitheroe.        ``And it's not just important for women, I'd encourage everyone to take control of their long-term financial plans, as well as putting themselves in charge of their money day to day,'' he said.        For further information contact the Financial Literacy Foundation. As well as the report there is a series of 14 information sheets to help women improve their money skills.        The information sheets are:1. Your relationship with money.        2. Starting out.        3. Managing on a low income.        4. Money and the single woman.        5.

102,Dividing the spoils,"BUSINESS Dividing the spoils       Q&A with accountant Phil Gostin        Q. How do you give your kids money without having to die first?        A. Assuming the parents have assets, and do not have any pension or concessions that could be affected in any way, it is as simple as realising the asset, paying the tax, (if applicable), and straight through to the keeper. But each situation is different.        Q. What are the consequences of giving your kids a deposit for their home or pay their kids school fees?        A. It depends. Firstly, do the parents have the ability to give? Will it impinge on their lifestyle? Will they cope in the event of failing health? The main consequences are effect on pension and tax. But if the parents have a super fund, no Centrelink issues, are retired and aged over 60 their ``drawings'' from funds are tax-free from July 1, 2007. However, if there is a Centrelink consequence, it needs to be looked at to ensure the best outcome.        Q. Is it better to withdraw lump sums from your super?        A. Because the goal posts have shifted, once you are retired and over 60 it's tax free -- whether it's taken as a lump or on the drip, is not the issue. The issue is to make it last, be able to give something to the kids if you can, or leave what remains to them.        Q. What about transferring assets into children's names?        A. The problem is the potential tax implications. Assuming assets were in the parents' name and post 1985, subject to capital gains tax, and if the parents still have significant income in their names, it might not be a good idea. But if the income is a pension from a super fund (self-managed or otherwise), then the tax may not be as significant.        Q. What are tax implications?        A. Tax is tax. Really the cashflow situation is the relevant one. For example, if we do this how much are we going to get? Again, it depends on what assessable income the parents are earning and from where -- ie. Centrelink.        Q. What are the limits or implications of gifting?        A. Gifting is only an issue if you have some aged pension benefit. You can only give $10,000 a year. It is important to note that you can give as much as you want but Centrelink will deem your asset base as dropping only by $10,000 a year. So you can give $100,000 but $90,000 is still included in the asset test when calculating the pension.        Q. Is it wiser to set up a family trust and make distributions that way?        A. The trust arrangement, first and foremost is about asset protection. It can be used for estate planning, but this ought to be done at set-up. What parents sometimes want to do is give the benefit of the investment without losing control of it.        DHS-20080331-1-030-597646",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
104,COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes,"COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes     Until lenders offer get out clauses so clients can switch out of 10- year fixed mortgages, longer term deals will remain a tough sell in terms of best advice, says Sally Laker      A couple of decades ago I would have given my right arm to have been able to fix my mortgage at 8%, let alone 5%. If it had been a 10-year deal even better. Why? Because interest rates were at 14%.      Luckily Bank of Scotland came to the rescue with what was called a stabiliser mortgage and this helped many a borrower survive. With this deal, the client agreed with the lender what rate they would pay. If interest rates went down they owed less and if they went up they owed more. An adjustment was then made to the loan after three years.      So what has all this got to do with fixed rates in today's marketplace? Well, it's a sign of the times. As I have mentioned, back in the late 1980s we would have done anything for a fixed rate and 8% would have been a steal but now things have changed so much that even a 10-year fixed rate at 4.99% will not necessarily fly out the door.      It seems crazy but we have become a nation of short-term fixers. We want two or three-year deals because we are ever optimistic that after two or three years the rates will be even lower. In reality this is unlikely to happen nowadays, but there will be a rate there or thereabouts.      So why not fix for longer and save switching every two years in hope of a better deal? In the case of best advice, it is a tough call to recommend a 10-year deal and effectively be sure that fix will be good for 10 years as well as proving that the client wouldn't be better off checking and switching every two years. Who can predict for certain that interest rates won't change much in 10 years, up or down?      Unless lenders can offer the equivalent of break clauses or get out clauses that allow borrowers to switch out of their fixes to other products during that 10-year period, longer term deals will be difficult to sell.      Nobody will want to pay hefty redemption penalties to switch even if it is to a more attractive product. Again, it is possible that many won't switch, but not having the option is a deterrent to even considering it.      We have become a nation of switchers. We switch credit cards, car insurance, house insurance - and now mortgages are seen as an extension of that.      This is all great news for brokers as it is their business to look after their clients and check their mortgages fit their requirements. And we know that those requirements can change in a two-year period - you only have to ask Tony Blair about that.",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0
106,Money Management: Keeping it in the family.,"Money Management: Keeping it in the family.     It was uncertain how many providers would launch family pension products after Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in the Budget that these plans would still attract a tax charge when passing pension assets from generation to generation.      But Origen, the IFA business owned by Aegon, has clearly decided that the product still has its attractions with the launch of its first family self-invested personal pension.      The pension is established under a separate sub-trust within a SIPP and brings spouses, children, family members or friends into the SIPP prior to death as additional members.      Up to age 75, pension members use drawdown to provide an income; if they die during this time, a dependant's pension may be paid or money may be taken out of the pension to be paid to a beneficiary, less a 35% tax charge.      From age 75, an alternatively secured pension (ASP) is used to provide income; if a member dies during this time any dependant's pension would be paid with the balance of the fund going to the recipients' pension schemes, minus any IHT liabilities.      Charges vary by type of member: founder members and additional members who contribute more than AGBP3,600 pa pay an establishment fee of AGBP300, an annual fee of AGBP500 and AGBP150 pa for drawing an income.      Additional members who contribute AGBP3,600 pa or less pay a set-up charge of AGBP250 and AGBP200 pa. Non-contributing members pay a set-up fee of AGBP250 then AGBP100 pa. IFA commission is available, but must be paid out of the client's funds.      www.origenfs.co.uk   MM view - In abolishing the requirement that everyone must buy an annuity by age 75, the Chancellor opened up the possibility of passing on pension assets after death. Until he clarified their tax position in the Budget, it had been hoped that they could be passed to the next generation intact, with no IHT liability.      However, Brown stated in the Budget that assets held in an ASP would be considered part of a pensioner's estate and therefore could be subject to IHT before being passed to heirs' pension funds.      Many people prefer passing on 60% of leftover pension assets to their heirs rather than nothing. But news has emerged that a loophole in the Finance Act 2005 makes it possible for pension assets to be passed to other scheme members without paying any IHT through a small self-administered scheme (SSAS).      SSASs are no longer required to purchase a pension from an insurance company and can instead pay out directly from the scheme itself, reallocating money to other scheme members when one member dies.      This type of pension is not an option for all, but for those that can set up SSASs, (eg, small family businesses), this loophole makes it a more attractive alternative than the family SIPP proposition. Any IFAs also wishing to market this SIPP should contact Origen direct.      monica.woodley@ft.com      49045288",1,1.0,0.0,0.0,0
111,Portman: Hasn't Received Any Takeover Approaches,"Portman: Hasn't Received Any Takeover Approaches     PERTH (Dow Jones)--Portman Ltd. (PMM.AU) said Monday that it hasn't had any approaches from Hong Kong's Mega Harvest Resources, despite media speculation that the iron ore miner is in the sights of Hong Kong businessman Lee Ming Tee.      ""There have been no discussions and no approaches at this point,"" Portman Managing Director Barry Eldridge told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.      His comments follows confirmation earlier Monday that Mega Harvest Resources Ltd. has increased its stake in Portman to 7.48% from 6.65%.      Eldridge said that he does not know whether Lee Ming Tee is associated with Mega Harvest, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.      ""We're in the process of trying to determine who the beneficial owners of Mega Harvest are and hopefully we'll get that in the next day or so,"" Eldridge said. [ 10-05-04 0451GMT ]      Portman hasn't appointed a corporate adviser, but is ""looking at our options"", Eldridge added.      A takeover offer from Mega Harvest is ""one possibility"", although Portman is not ruling out that the company may be a ""passive investor"", he said.      ""I don't know what their intentions are as I haven't spoken to them,"" he added.      An Australian newspaper report Monday said interests associated with Lee Ming Tee are planning a takeover move after becoming Portman's biggest stakeholder through recent share purchases.      Shares in Portman have risen by around 13% since mid-April, in defiance of downward pressure on mining shares caused by fears of an economic slowdown in China.      Portman is currently ramping up an expansion of its Koolyanobbing mine in Western Australia following long delays due to environmental restrictions.      The company is Australia's third biggest iron ore producer, but is much smaller than industry heavyweights Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP).      Portman sells around three quarters of its annual production in China and expects to produce more than five million metric tons of iron ore in 2004.      Late last month, Eldridge said he was comfortable the company will meet market profit forecasts for 2004.      Predictions from analysts are broadly between A$26 million and A$30 million, he noted. ""I'm comfortable with that range,"" he said.      Portman's marketing office in Beijing doesn't expect efforts in China to slow the local economy to have ""any impact on the demand for our iron ore,"" he added at the time.      At about 0500 GMT, Portman's shares were up two cents at A$1.63, off its intraday high of A$1.65. The company has a market capitalization of about A$280 million.      The substantial shareholder notice filed by Mega Harvest Resources said it now owned 12.82 million Portman shares, up from 11.40 million shares when the last notice was filed.

They do scientific work for the provincial government and have defined benefits at retirement Yet they have financial assets of just which at their ages is modest Wendy expects a windfall payment from a labour agreement Even with that their resources for raising their children will be strained At present they put just a month into their children s Registered Education Savings Plans nothing into their RRSPs and into their Tax Free Savings Accounts less than half their allowable amount and just an eighth of what they might use to fill their space They have not made wills or appointed guardians for their children We work hard to be debt free to put sweat equity into our home and to buy with cash rather than credit Harry explains Early retirement say is our goal They want to buy a condo for the children s grandparents to use when they are in town and to rent out at other times But does buying a second property make sense and they wonder what would its effect be on other goals such as funding the kids educations and their own retirement Family Finance asked Derek Moran head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with Harry and Wendy PRESENT FINANCES Harry and

provide pension contributions so their RRSP space is drastically reduced by the pension adjustment Given their other needs they can just forget about adding to their RRSPs Over time they can direct

The question is fundamental to judging the cost effectiveness of government and the necessity of the polarizing Act 10, in which Gov. Scott Walker instituted dramatic benefit cuts for unionized public workers to help balance the budget. But scholars disagree substantially on how Wisconsin s public and private workers compare in terms of wages Two recent studies show salaries and benefits for public workers are about percent more than comparable private workers but another study asserts public workers make percent less The key divide is over how to calculate retirement benefits Public employers also have a more compressed pay scale said Charlie Carlson a Middleton labor expert who has done public private compensation comparisons for municipalities across the state He told Gannett Wisconsin Media that local governments typically pay less than private employers to top managers roughly the same to mid level skilled workers and more to those in lower skilled positions But local market factors mean the comparison may vary widely among municipalities And statewide comparisons can t be done on a position by position basis since public sector jobs such as police and firefighters don t have private sector equivalents The solution for academic researchers is a human capital approach in which workers are compared on factors that affect compensation rather than on the specific occupation Some studies include dozens of variables the primary ones being education experience the skill required by a given job and the number of hours worked This doesn t yield results for specific entities that is addressed in a flurry of local studies commissioned after Act But it can show on a statewide basis how public and private workers compare in terms of pay and benefits depending on whom you believe Studies vary on compensation comparison Three recent studies examining pay and benefits use different methods and come to disparate conclusions Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute and Jason Richwine of the Heritage Foundation wrote in a May study for the conservative American Enterprise Institute that state of Wisconsin employees are paid percent more than their private sector counterparts State workers total compensation was about percent higher before Act they said The study showed salaries are roughly equivalent between the public and private sectors but benefits are a different story Even after Act state workers pensions are nearly five times as valuable as those in the private sector and health benefits are about twice as generous A November study from the MacIver Institute a conservative Madison based think tank said Wisconsin s public sector employees received pay and benefits percent above the private sector The study co authored by William Even an economics professor at Miami University in Ohio covers both state and local government employees but does not account for Act changes since it uses data from The two studies contrast sharply with a February study that Jeffrey Keefe conducted for the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington D C Keefe said Wisconsin s state and local public employees received pay and benefits totaling percent less than their private sector counterparts even before Act reduced the value of public benefits The MacIver Institute study differed from the others in not taking into account the size of the employer Larger companies generally pay higher wages and benefits and government entities are relatively large so the studies by Keefe and Biggs compared salaries only to private firms of employees or more Pensions key to study differences The main difference among the three studies arises from disagreement over the value of public pensions Olivia Mitchell executive director of the Pension Research Council at The Wharton School in Pennsylvania said the rate of interest used in the calculations is crucial since the pension plan s cost to taxpayers rises by nearly percent with every percent reduction in the assumed interest rate Most government agencies assume an percent rate of return in determining how much to pay into the pension fund annually to yield the promised payouts at retirement Keefe s study calculated pension value simply on the amount paid in by the employers He said the methodology used in the other two studies is extremely conservative and assumes virtually no return on the pension fund Biggs and Richwine used a rate of return of approximately percent in their calculations which Biggs said is an accurate estimate for a no risk investment and is on par with a government bond rate Public pension amounts are backed by the government and carry no risk to employees unlike a typical private sector retirement plan that has no guaranteed value at retirement Even who did the MacIver Institute study also used a return rate of about percent He said if he assumed an percent rate as Keefe did his study would have shown a percent premium for public workers in Wisconsin instead of percent No one who has a k plan would be correct in assuming they re going to earn percent on their money for the rest of their life Even said You re making a promise that is backed by the faith of the state government so the thinking is you should assume an interest rate that the state should borrow at We assumed a percent rate and if anything I think in today s world that s probably a little

You may soon have the chance to back out of this once-irreversible purchase by jumping into the secondary annuities market. But exercise this freedom with caution; experts say many retirees could regret taking the pensions parachute.
An annuity allows people to get hold of their hard-earned retirement savings in a responsible way. It converts your pension pot into a carefully calculated annual income that should comfortably last the rest of your life However this product available direct from pension providers or online brokers has often been accused of offering poor value for money particularly when bought without financial advice or by people in poor health Critics say it is all too easy to be lulled into uncompetitive rates if you fail to shop around depriving you of income that is particularly precious if do not have long to live Retirees have previously had no ability to trade in annuities or substitute them for a different product That is all changing following George Osborne s pensions revolution of Now the Government is giving people even greater freedoms with plans to establish a secondary annuities market SAM Due to be launched on April next year SAM will enable people to cash in their annuities in exchange for a lump sum to spend or invest how they see fit HMRC is now in the process of ironing out tax implications after launching a consultation predicting that people could take up this option Meanwhile the Financial Conduct Authority has published its own blueprint for SAM but with a warning that sellers could be exposed to significant risks Indeed experts have voiced their own misgivings arguing that SAM could be just as much of a minefield as the first hand annuities industry Tom McPhail head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown says There are still unanswered questions around the regulation of the market and how consumer protection could work we need to make sure investors don t end up getting ripped off by their insurance company for some of them possibly not for the first time Andrew Tully at Retirement Advantage says that customers with very small annuities may find a capital lump sum more appealing than a small monthly income but warns that SAM will be a complicated market He goes on We need to ensure people who currently receive poor value annuities do not think the secondary market is their means of escape Two wrongs will clearly not make it right trading your annuity is not the panacea for the lack of shopping around at retirement So how will SAM work Broadly speaking sellers can hand over their annuities to a third party an authorised broker in return for a lump sum or to buy a flexi access drawdown fund or flexible annuity The requirement to take financial advice is likely to be mandatory above a certain threshold and the customer will have to go through a new underwriting process to check health and lifestyle Mr Tully says The buyer for your annuity will consider your current health and how long they think you will live This may be different to when you originally bought the annuity if your health has since deteriorated and you will probably need to complete a medical questionnaire This will all help the buyer work out how much income they think is left from your annuity and therefore the value they will place on it Of course these things aren t cheap and there will likely be substantial costs for doing a deal He cites the costs for a medical administration possible advice and the need for the buyer to make a profit although commission will not be charged The biggest stumbling block could be tax this is payable on the cash lump sum which will be considered as part of your normal income and calculated at your income tax rate This reduces what you get from the deal and may even push you into the higher tax bracket per cent Indeed the Treasury has estimated it will make million from tax receipts in the first two years of SAM You need to be hard headed about how you will manage your pension if you trade in your annuity The SAM option may be viable if you have other sources of income such as multiple pensions or dividends from your investment portfolio much less so if you are completely reliant on your annuity Plus you cannot go back once you trade in your annuity meaning you have to be certain it is the right deal for you and you may also give up the right to transfer your annuity income to your spouse if you pass away If you do decide to cash in Steven Cameron from Edinburgh based pensions firm Aegon recommends seeking professional advice or at the very least shopping around to get the best deal He also suggests flexible drawdown as a less drastic alternative to a lump sum You can then take an income when you wish and only pay income tax on the amount you take out often cutting your tax bill",0,,,0.0,0

Stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters.","PolitiFact Ohio
Stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters. Mitt Romney In an ad airing in Ohio called Where did all the money go the Romney campaign accuses President Obama of supporting jobs overseas and cites the example of Fisker Automotive the maker of a high end plug in electric sedan Where did all the Obama stimulus money go Friends donors campaign supporters special interest groups Where did the Obama stimulus money go Solyndra million taxpayer dollars Bankrupt So where did the Obama stimulus money go Windmills from China Electric cars from Finland The day after that ad launched Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus expanded on the attack in Philadelphia President Obama took half a billion dollars of your taxpayer money and gave it to Fisker Automotive because they promised to create jobs at their Wilmington plant Priebus said But they didn t create jobs for you Their factory in Delaware was supposed to be open today but instead it s closed And Fisker is still building their cars in Finland Did stimulus money go to Finland What is the financial deal between the United States and Fisker and did it produce jobs in the U S Was that deal a payback to special friends of the Obama administration What Fisker got In an American car company Fisker Automotive won a total of million in loan guarantees to build two high end electric hybrids the Karma and the Atlantic originally named Nina The goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware Work on the Atlantic is currently on hold and the Delaware plant has yet to open The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States but according to the U S Energy Department the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about Finnish workers Company spokesman Roger Ornisher says the plant has produced over Karmas so far Not stimulus dollars The claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects First the money did not come from the stimulus Rather it came as a loan not a grant or a tax credit through the Energy Department s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program That program predates the Obama administration It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act also known as the stimulus In fact it s a program signed into existence by President George W Bush in and first funded by legislation Bush signed in The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application The Obama administration was in charge when the company s loan was approved The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it Not half a billion dollars Even as a loan Fisker Automotive has not received anywhere close to half a billion dollars So far Fisker has drawn down about million and the Energy Department won t release any more until the company completes more work The government loan package came in two parts An initial million was for design and engineering to complete the Karma using at least percent American made parts A second million loan would be to open an American plant to build the Atlantic Just about all of that second part is still in government hands For those who would say there s no guarantee that some of the federal dollars were not used to pay Finnish workers the company has an answer It says it raised much more money from private investors Ornisher told PolitiFact the total is now over billion and that the money spent in Finland was easily within the amount of that private money Fisker Automotive also says that the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to ensure that all federal dollars are spent in the U S The jobs The Karma and Atlantic projects support some Fisker employees in the United States according to Ornisher He says it s much harder to estimate the number of jobs associated with the supply of parts percent of which are supposed to come from American companies Ornishers also says the company has sold about cars in the U S and that provides work at some retailers across the country Political connections The ad hints darkly that a lot of this is tied to political friends of the president Senior Romney campaign adviser Ed Gillespie singled out the Fisker Automotive deal and one of its investors John Doerr You know you have John Doerr who raised a lot of money for President Obama and got appointed to an economic recovery advisory board he said during a briefing And then his firm had a big investment in Fisker Automotive which got over half a billion dollars in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy which did not result in jobs being created in America but actually jobs being created overseas in Finland But Kleiner Perkins Doerr s firm did quite well Doerr is a big Democratic donor more than since according to the Center for Responsive Politics And Ornisher described Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers as one of the major investors in Fisker But as the Washington Post noted Kleiner has many partners and some of them are hefty donors on the Republican side One Ray Lane backed John McCain in The Romney campaign ad said that stimulus dollars paid for jobs in Finland There is nothing accurate in this claim The loan guarantees Fisker got were not part of the stimulus and there is no evidence that any government dollars paid for work done by Finnish workers Ornisher the company spokesman told PolitiFact the contract to produce the cars in Finland had been signed before the federal loan was approved Also measures were put in place to ensure that taxpayer dollars only went for work done in America Fisker Automotive has yet to open the factory in Delaware but it also hasn t received the large government loan needed to do that The ad s suggestion that the Fisker loan was a reward to a political supporter also falls flat The program was approved initially by the Bush administration We rule the claim False See PolitiFact Ohio stories online at

according to both the department of trade and industry's debt task
force, many more women are in the red. The trend won't show up in the
national bankruptcy statistics for another year or so. But there is
another barometer: the popularity of a financial scheme called Women
Empowering Women (WEW).
 A system which purports to help women help each other it is in fact a traditional pyramid selling scam and one which many women are getting into debt to join Despite months of negative publicity since the scheme collapsed on the Isle of Wight earlier this year thousands are still paying to put their their names on a heart chart as the pyramids are known There are schemes all over Britain with an estimated women involved The set up is informal there is no central organisation You go to a party have a glass of wine and a handful of crisps hand over the money and leave with your heart Once eight investors have entered below you on the pyramid chart you collect Some women claim to have collected within days The scheme runs on word of mouth most women join through a friend colleague or relative To keep it going they just recruit more friends Financially it works but only at first But sooner rather than later the scheme runs short of recruits On the Isle of Wight with a population of only the scheme faltered within months leaving an estimated of investors with nothing and no chance of compensation Even in the US with its vast population where schemes ran under names like The Ya Ya Sisterhood after Rebecca Wells s girl bonding novel WEW collapsed within a year By the end of last year as the craze reached a peak more than a dozen women were arrested for running gifting clubs and hundreds more face law suits The practice is now illegal in nine states Tracey McHale is a typical Isle of Wight victim A beautician and single mother from Shanklin she lost in May when she invested in a scheme she had heard about on the local radio station The day I went to give in my money there were five other women queueing with cash I just got given a blank piece of paper which was supposed to be my heart From day one I thought it was a fraud but all I heard was good news about it that people had bought new kitchens and had all this money She has joined another scheme the Isle of Wight s Community Investment Club with other losers and from an initial stake has had back so far I joined this one because I had no choice I had lost every penny I had she says To survive and find new recruits the scheme sugar coats a direct appeal to greed by telling women they will be helping other women and getting their own back on the male dominated capitalist system Although WEW has apparently no central structure there is literature usually badly photocopied and barely legible or downloaded from the internet It uses woolly touchy feely caring sharing phrases such as supporting other women and says WEW aims to facilitate a safe place to help eradicate the poverty and isolation that many women suffer This is the sort of language that first attracted Sharon A housewife and mother of two from Sutton Coldfield her husband is managing director of a company and they have a second home in Spain She is going through the heart chart for the second time It s about supporting each other I joined with my friend we went halves and each paid Within five weeks we collected between us I haven t seen any harm come out of it I ve seen women collect She is annoyed that the bad publicity is stopping more women from benefiting It was on GMTV and since then it s more difficult to get people to join she says Bridget from North London says she was also impressed by the so called gifting aspect of the scheme Women who have already had a pay out or can afford to be generous anyway are encouraged to help out less fortunate women by paying some or all of their share I joined this scheme to help other women make money and I can see that it works I have seen a lot of women make thousands already and give other women the chance to join But it s the caring and sharing approach that makes WEW dangerous says Robert Fitzpatrick president of Pyramid Scheme Alert a leading US authority on financial scams It purports to be a new value system support not competition giving not taking networking These are portrayed as values that women are particularly tuned into And they are values scorned in the normal business world That resonates very strongly with a lot of women WEW has nothing to do with women per se All the rhetoric used in WEW can be said of all the other pyramid schemes They always spread by personal contact you need a camouflage a story geared towards a specific group If the group is New Agey the story will be about vaguely philosophical concepts like attracting abundance into your life Similarly there are schemes in the US for African Americans which promote exactly the same ideals as Women Empowering Women about overcoming past grievances making up for previous losses getting even after discrimination Donna Bradshaw is a director at the London based financial advisers Fiona Price Partners which specialises in giving advice to women She has been approached by several professional women asking whether they should invest in WEW Women are portrayed as less financially astute and this scheme is taking advantage of that Basically it panders to people s greed although they wrap it up very nicely Some of the women seem to get so confused by the logistics of it all that it is legal to use their annual gift exemption of for example that they don t look at the mechanics Which is that sooner or later it will dry up I would really like to see it made illegal The title makes me sick You re not empowering anyone you re just weakening your financial position The women who remain in WEW however are convinced that they are right no matter what anyone says Sharon even plans to re invest to stop the cycle from ending But as Fitzpatrick points out Re investing will delay the in evitable but it can t change the maths God forbid that someone asks the horrible question Where does it all end Because that is the whole point of course it will end And more than of people who have invested money will lose it",1,,,0.0,0

Mike Beebe on Wednesday called a special session, to begin Thursday, on a plan to stabilize health insurance premiums for teachers and other public school employees.

Beebe said legislative leaders informed him they have enough votes in the House and Senate to pass a series of bills ranging from stopgap legislation to hold down rate increases next year to a comprehensive plan to stabilize the public school employees' health insurance system. The special session is set to begin at p m Thursday If everybody agrees and it goes smoothly it could go Thursday Friday and Saturday Beebe said The governor s call for a special session includes six bills Four will address the rising health insurance costs and one which is backed by the governor and will be considered separately would phase out the excess property tax revenue some school districts have kept and redirect those funds to the state The sixth bill added late Wednesday afternoon would repeal Act of which eased regulatory requirements on municipalities and industries that discharge minerals into Arkansas waterways The proposals to address the teacher insurance crisis includes both a short term and long term solution The short term proposal calls for using million from the state surplus to avert a percent rise in health insurance rates set to go into effect Jan Another million a year would hold down future increases I would not be issuing this call if we hadn t already seen extraordinary bipartisan efforts to help our teachers and other public school employees in Arkansas Beebe said Wednesday After dozens of meetings with legislators district officials teachers and other involved parties we have a solution that may not please every individual group but will help alleviate the spike in insurance rates and shore up this insurance program The governor told reporters earlier Wednesday that House leaders had secured votes two in excess of the needed for a three fourths majority to pass the appropriations Senate leaders who Tuesday were a few votes shy of a supermajority notified the governor early Wednesday they had secured votes two more than the three fourths majority needed in that chamber Sen Johnny Key R Mountain Home chairman of the Senate Eduction Committee said Wednesday some members finally agreed to support the plan to address the rising teacher insurance costs when more emphasis was placed a proposal to create a task force to study long term structural reforms of the public employees insurance program Several senators wanted assurances that the task force would be proactive and not fall apart or have its recommendations sit on a shelf Key said The legislative intent is we re not going to have to continue to bail out the system he told reporters Reforms are going to have to take place and if they don t take place this funding stream that we re putting in there we re going to pull those back down the road if we don t adopt real reforms The task force would be required to issue a report and make recommendations by June to be reviewed by legislative committees and all budget issues addressed in time for consideration in the legislative session Key said the panel would conduct a comprehensive review of the state and public school employee insurance systems including governance and structure board structure and funding options Separately lawmakers will consider the phase out of excess property tax revenue held by some districts Beebe said the measure would address a Arkansas Supreme Court ruling and keep the state s school funding in line with the intent of provisions that ended the long running Lake View school funding case As for addressing the school employees insurance crisis Beebe set legislative consensus on both short term and long term solutions as a condition for calling a special session Legislative leaders quickly forged agreement on using surplus funds for the short term fix The long term plan took more time It would redirect million annually to the school employees health insurance system million from general revenue million from the school facilities improvement program and million from state funding for teacher professional development Another million would be passed on to school employees in the form of premiums though that amount could be reduced as a result of reforms to be recommended by the task force Some lawmakers said Wednesday they support the overall plan but don t like tapping funding for professional development to pay for health insurance I think this is a move in the wrong direction said Sen Uvalde Lindsey D Fayetteville Currently there is a push for implementation of Common Core implementation of strategies for better outcomes for students all of those sorts of things seem to me that now is not the time to reduce the hours of professional development that we need more And so I quarrel with that reduction but I would grudgingly hold my nose and probably vote for it The health insurance rates for school employees have been rising for several years because of a lack of funding from the state and local school districts Also a million catastrophic claims fund was wiped out by five claims in and that each totaled more than million The Legislature this year appropriated million for the program In September Bob Alexander director of the Employee Benefits Division told a legislative committee it would take million in new money to keep premium rates at current levels next year As lawmakers considered ways to hold down premium increases officials earlier this month pushed back the enrollment period for employees covered by the health insurance plan from Oct to Nov The health insurance system told the governor it needed some direction by Tuesday so that it could begin preparing material for the sign up period The board met Tuesday and voted to begin the process of printing up materials based on the proposal now being considered by lawmakers In discussing the late addition of the proposal to repeal Act Beebe said that was added

The trustees will have to decide what to do, and how to tell members. Members and trustees will be angry or upset that despite all the advice the funds are paying for they can end up in such a bind. The actuaries will point out how there is now a bigger hole in the pension fund They may permit themselves the luxury of explaining that over the past year uncharacteristically if the fund had been more fully invested in government bonds it would have done a lot better Unfortunately you cannot be sure of paying rising pensions that go up with increased lifespans and with wage inflation out of fixed income bonds The investment advisers will probably have some figures to show they did not do too badly taking cover in relative performance figures showing the trustees could have lost more if they had been with someone else or in something worse Many will be able to say they were not responsible for the main cause of the loss They did what they were asked or followed an asset allocation laid down by someone else If the trustees have the temerity to ask why they have lost so much money the professional advisers are likely to point the finger back Trustees they will say make the overall asset allocation decision how much will be in equities and how much in cash and they chose the specialist investment managers to carry it all out The trustees will be left pondering why they spent a small fortune in fees yet lacked the advice on the one thing that really matters how much to have in cash how much in bonds and how much in shares They paid the piper but ended up singing the song themselves At this point all eyes will turn to the sponsoring company representatives They will be expected to make up another black hole in the pension fund They are likely to report that prospects for the company have taken several turns for the worst and it hopes the fund can manage with less as it is laying people off and strapped for cash It wants the trustees to invest the company s contributions better to cut the need to drain the company of more cash that it needs to safeguard jobs and invest in the future Meanwhile the members will be worried whether they have the right people standing up for their interests and should the trustees be tougher with those who have managed to help the fund lose so much money Members should think about going to the next meeting to show their concern and to ask some questions about what is going to be done to try to put it right Turning up may strengthen the resolve of the trustees to take some action So what is the way out of this bind The first thing trustees can do is to ask themselves how much active management of their shares is costing them In most cases it is significant money If a pounds m equity portfolio underperforms the index by pc after expenses and I have seen some which have that is a massive pounds m a year This cost could be largely spared by investing the equity portfolio in tracker funds such as Exchange Traded Funds which can save the fund hundreds of thousands of pounds The trustees could then afford some asset allocation advice which would cost considerably less than the average losses on active management If the advice is any good it could spare them some of the losses that come from staying too fully invested in bad times like It also gives them the comfort of knowing they have taken proper advice for the most important decisions I have been a pension trustee so I know how difficult it can be to get change in a pension fund It is not going to be easy explaining large losses to members or to sponsoring companies Maybe it is time trustees made their task easier by taking some advice and cutting management costs John Redwood MP is chairman of Evercore Pan Asset asset allocation advisers www pan asset com",0,,,0.0,0

There are pros and cons of having your current account and mortgage with the same lender.","YOUR MONEY

There are pros and cons of having your current account and mortgage with the same lender. Esther Shaw reports WHEN it comes to taking out a new mortgage loan or savings account the adage is that it pays to shop around However there are now several providers who are bundling two or more products together and offering preferential rates to customers who take out the whole package For example if you sign up for a bank s current account you may get a better rate on your mortgage While bundling is already common practice on the Continent this trend has to date been far less prevalent here in the UK But that could be about to change according to Michael White from mortgage website Email Mortgages This sort of arrangement does seem to be in its infancy says White But it is growing in popularity and we would expect other providers to start bundling Abbey has begun offering through a limited number of distributors a switcher product range that bundles together a mortgage and a current account The offer is a per cent reduction on the mortgage rate for those borrowers taking out their main personal bank account with Abbey says White This means that for a two year fixed rate deal up to per cent loan to value LTV Abbey will offer a rate of per cent for those who take out its bank account This compares to a rate of per cent for those who don t For a two year deal with a slightly higher LTV of per cent the rate is per cent for those who take out an Abbey bank account and for those who do not If you re looking for a new mortgage you may be tempted by the Abbey deal but it s crucial that you do your research before signing on the dotted line The Abbey approach is an interesting one says Andrew Hagger from price comparison service Moneynet co uk However I m not convinced that many customers will want to go through the hassle of switching their bank account at the same time that they are moving house or buying a new home When you take on a new home you will for example have a whole set of new standing orders and direct debits which need to be set up such as your mortgage council tax and utility bills Buying a house is stressful enough let alone trying to switch your bank account at the same time says Hagger White adds that potential customers need to do their sums The savings would need to be substantial for customers to consider moving their bank account because of the perception of the hassle involved he says Elsewhere within its stable of products Abbey is offering a rate of per cent on a regular saver account the Super Fixed Rate Monthly Saver Issue to customers who open one of its current or packaged accounts Abbey is also offering a Super Direct Cash individual savings account Isa Issue paying per cent if you invest the same amount in a qualifying investment product Hagger says This could be either an equity based investment or a pension product HSBC is offering a deal that current account products enabling customers who hold one of its packaged Plus accounts to qualify for a per cent discount on its standard mortgages But you do have to pay a monthly fee of for this account and sign for a minimum of months says Hagger From time to time custom also have the opportunity to for a regular saver account at a a preferential rate and if you take loan for two years or more and let it run its course HSBC will refund per cent of the interest paid NatWest also offers a bundled mortgage and bank account deal White says This is similar to the Abbey deal offering a per cent reduction on the mortgage rate if the customer takes out a NatWest account As a bonus NatWest also reduce the application fee for the mortgage from to The Co op also offers better mortgage rates for current account customers and Privilege customers Warning to handle packages with care WHILE bundled deals may appear attractive consumers are urged to approach such offers with care Bundled deals can sometimes be a regressive move warns Mark Harris from mortgage broker Savills Private Finance You only have to look at the compulsory insurance products of the s that would get you a better rate to see that bundling is not always in the consumer s best interests Hagger says providers are relying on consumer apathy Lenders may be banking on the fact that some customers would perhaps find it more convenient to have all their eggs in one basket and es p eciall y if the y are not rate conscious he says Packaging products is preying on customers who don t shop around But while this may seem more convenient in the majority of cases this will mean consumers are not getting the best deals The idea of bundling is a good one adds Hagger But in reality it s hard to find one provider that is the best across a range of personal finance product areas This is a view shared by Harris Bundling makes the comparison process more difficult he says As a consumer you should choose products on an individual basis and select the best one for you It pays to sho p around Beware marketing tactics FOR many banks and building societies existing and trusted customers are the prime target for cross selling other products the key product is the current account Once a provider has you as a current account customer you are unlikely to switch away unless you receive poor service says Andrew Hagger at Moneynet The current account is a gateway that allows the bank to understand your spending habits This can make it easier for them to sell you lucrative pension and investment products Banks may also offer preferential rates on loans and mortgages to their own customers because they regard them as lower risk Some lenders offer existing customers slightly better deals because they have immediate access to the customer s account information says Louise Holmes from financial analyst Moneyfacts This means the bank or building society can carry out all manner of checks quickly and easily from general account management to money laundering With borrowing down in the current uncertain climate lenders are also looking for new ways to claw back lost revenue Bundling is becoming more common as lenders seek to maximise revenue says Mark Harris from Savills Private Finance",0,,,0.0,0

   By Dan Ariely 

Dear Dan, During a recent trip to Los Angeles I stopped by a coffee shop offering a very expensive coffee called kopi luwak or civet coffee I asked about the steep price and the barista told me the story of the special process required to make this coffee A catlike Indonesian animal known as a civet eats coffee cherries and then poops out what are basically beans People then collect these processed beans and use them to make a highly unusual brew that is said to be smoother than its journey It can sell for hundreds of dollars per pound I was curious but not interested or brave enough to buy it let alone drink it Can you explain why people are willing to pay for this Chahriar First I think you made a mistake You should have paid up and tried a cup in part because you are still clearly curious about it in part because it would have made a much better story and what are a few dollars compared with a good story So the next time you pass by a coffee place with kopi luwak try it maybe even get the double shot with hair and all the trimmings As for civet coffee s quality The promotional material that I found says that civets know how to pick the best coffee beans and that their digestive systems ferment the beans reducing their acidity and providing a much better coffee I have no idea how this works but the story piqued my curiosity too So why are people willing to pay so much for civet coffee It is probably for the novelty and the story and because the amount and type of labor involved is clearly so much higher than for your average cup of Java People are generally willing to pay more for something that requires more effort to produce even if the product itself isn t better and civet coffee sounds like a prime example of this effort based pricing principle Finally I wonder how much people would be willing to pay had the beans passed through an American human rather than an exotic Indonesian animal My guess That would be too strong a brew for any of us Dear Dan Are financial advisers a wise investment Mine charges me each year for all my assets under their management Is it worth it Allan It is hard to know for sure But the fact that many financial advisers have different hidden fees suggests to me that they themselves don t think that people would pay if they charged for their services in a clear and upfront way To help you think about this question in your own life let s contrast two cases In case one you are charged of your assets under management and this amount is taken directly from your brokerage account once a month In case two you pay the same overall amount but you send a monthly check to your financial adviser The second case more directly and clearly depicts the cost of your financial adviser providing a better frame for your question So put yourself in the mind set of the second case and ask yourself if you would pay directly for these services If the answer is yes keep your financial adviser if the answer is no you have your first action plan for the New Year Dear Dan Every year when Christmas comes I feel an obligation to send Christmas cards to everyone I know and every year the number of cards I send gets larger It is now officially getting out of hand May I switch to sending cards only to my really close friends Holly It is fine to send cards only to your good friends I don t think anyone left off the list would be offended and you would also reduce their feeling of obligation to send you a card next year And if you really want to eliminate the Christmas card frenzy there is always Judaism Have a dilemma for Dan Email AskAriely wsj com END Dow Jones Newswires December ET GMT",0,,,0.0,0

Since you've joined the workforce, you might be paying back your loans as best you can. But can you gradually reduce your debts while still putting money away for your long-term goals - such as retirement? Of course you might think it s premature to even think about retiring since you probably have decades to go before you say goodbye to the working world But the sooner you begin saving and investing for retirement the more time you ll have for your money to grow Plus your early start will help you avoid having to play catch up later Still it can be challenging to juggle payments for student loans and contributions to a retirement account especially if your loans are sizable How can you meet these two separate demands on your income To begin with you may have some flexibility in how you repay your student loan Although you might have selected or were assigned a repayment plan when you first begin repaying your student loan you can typically change this plan to accommodate your financial situation You ll need to contact your loan servicer for details on adjusting your repayments In any case though if you have a large student loan it s safe to say that you will be paying it back for quite some time So rather than wait for this debt to be cleared before you start saving for retirement think about how you can take action now For one thing take full advantage of your k or similar employer sponsored retirement plan This type of plan certainly offers some key benefits Your earnings can grow on a tax deferred basis and you typically contribute on a pretax basis which means the more you put in the lower your taxable income Plus you can fund your plan with a variety of investment choices But for you perhaps the biggest benefit is that your employer simply takes the money from your paycheck before you get it and puts it into your account You don t have to pay all your bills first and then hope you still have something left to invest it s already been done for you Ultimately contributing to your k can be a painless way of investing and it may make it easier psychologically at least for you to pursue the two goals of paying your college debts and saving for the future If you don t have a k or similar plan you can still follow the same principle of essentially freeing yourself from initiating investment moves simply by setting up a bank authorization to automatically transfer money from your checking or savings account into an IRA which offers some of the same features as a k You can start with relatively small amounts perhaps as little as per month and increase your contributions as your income rises As you well remember college wasn t cheap And you don t want to make it even more costly by having your student loan payments interfere with progress you can make toward your retirement funding goals So think about automating the contributions to your retirement accounts The effort or rather the effortlessness on your part can be well worth it This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor",1,,,1.0,1

At a glance","Rima Haddad looks at how exchange-traded products can fit into a scheme portfolio

At a glance In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn globally as at the end of October The increasing use of ETPs is part of the growth in passive investing The UK pensions market has been significantly affected by regulatory reforms There are a couple of themes at the core of these reforms that are particularly relevant in the context of this article Costs and performance Transparency Liquidity We will briefly consider why exchange traded products ETPs are a relevant investment tool for trustees and advisers to consider when evaluating investment strategies with a particular emphasis on costs and performance In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn trn globally as at the end of October This represents a year compound annual growth rate of ETPs are open ended investment vehicles that generally track an underlying benchmark and are listed on an exchange ETPs are transparent instruments to the extent that index and product holdings are openly published Additionally as they are exchange traded prices are quoted intraday providing both transparent price discovery and accessibility Although liquidity and transparency are additional benefits the increasing use of ETPs is as much a reflection of the growing influence of passive investing more broadly across the asset management industry Investors are now questioning whether active managers are able to consistently outperform their benchmarks and are invariably turning to passive instruments like ETPs to provide consistent risk adjusted market returns Value for money The Pensions Regulator published its new draft DC code on th November In this report it emphasises the importance of assessing whether schemes offer value for money VFM Although there is not a prescribed definition of VFM costs and charges are highlighted as being an important consideration Fund management fees and portfolio transaction costs are referenced in particular On these two cost metrics ETPs are generally more cost efficient than actively managed funds The asset weighted expense ratio not including portfolio transaction costs for passive funds was only in compared with for active funds The above figures are particularly relevant when considering the charge controls on default arrangements in certain occupational pension schemes Lower cost passive solutions become more relevant when taking into consideration the p a cap that has recently been implemented Add lower portfolio transaction costs to this and the case for using passive instruments like ETPs to manage scheme costs begins to resonate with an increasing number of investment managers Cost however should not be considered in isolation In its guidance for DC pension schemes The Pensions Regulator states As investment returns net of charges have such a major impact on member outcomes trustees should pay particular attention in any VFM assessment to the investment return delivered to members In effect costs are a component of total investment returns therefore it is prudent for us to turn to the wider argument of how passive returns compare to actively managed funds and how ETPs can be implemented in schemes to improve risk adjusted returns Comparing active and passive investment returns The regulatory focus on costs and performance are not exclusive to DC schemes The government commissioned Hymans Robertson report looked at how the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS could be reformed The report specifically questioned whether active managers are providing consistent above benchmark returns to justify their higher overall costs Indeed it was concluded that over an extended period of time active equity returns across various geographical regions failed to outperform the benchmark and that this trend was particularly prevalent in the case of developed market equities The conclusions in this report are consistent with the findings in a recent Morningstar study that compared active and passive returns across various US equity size and style categories The research found that over a ten year period aggregate passive funds outperformed active funds across eight of the nine defined categories In light of growing evidence of active manager underperformance the value proposition that they offer is being questioned by an increasing number of investment managers Trustees assessing whether schemes are offering VFM should be aware of the potential benefits of using passive instruments like ETPs either alongside or in place of certain active funds A smarter way forward With the future in mind one area of particular growth has been in smart beta products Their goal is to provide improved risk adjusted returns either increase returns and or reduce risk and enhanced diversification over the long term The strategies implemented are non market cap weighted and deliver exposure to systematic investment factors or alternative weighting schemes Investors can now access a variety of smart beta equity and fixed income exposures allowing one to gain exposure to a risk premium in a cheaper systematic way In the new era of VFM ETPs generally and specifically smart beta exposures provide an additional tool for managers to use in member pension schemes Rima Haddad is head of UK

To understand why this is so, let's look at three common mistakes investors make: Selling investments and moving to cash when stocks are predicted to drop If you follow the financial news on cable TV or the internet you re eventually bound to discover some experts who are predicting imminent huge drops in the stock market And on rare occasions they may be right but often they re not And if you were to sell some of your stocks or stock based investments based on a prediction and move the money to cash or a cash equivalent you could miss out on possible future growth opportunities if the predictor was wrong And the investments you sold still could have played a valuable part in your portfolio balance Selling underperforming assets in favor of strong performers As an investor it can be tempting to unload an investment for one of those hot ones you read about that may have topped one list or another Yet there s no guarantee that investment will stay on top the next year or even perform particularly well Conversely your own underperformers of today could be next year s leaders Waiting for today s risk or uncertainty to disappear before investing Investing always involves risk and uncertainty Instead of waiting for the perfect time to invest you re better off building a portfolio based on your goals risk tolerance and time horizon All these mistakes are examples of a risky investment strategy trying to time the market If you try to be a market timer not only will you end up questioning your buy sell decisions but you also might lose sight of why you bought certain investments in the first place Specifically you might own stocks or mutual funds because they are appropriate for your portfolio and your risk tolerance and they can help you make progress toward your long term financial goals And these attributes don t automatically disappear when the value of these stocks or funds has dropped so you could end up selling investments that could still be doing you some good many years into the future While trying to time the market is a difficult investment strategy even for the professionals it doesn t mean you can never take advantage of falling prices In fact you can use periodic dips in the market to buy quality assets at more attractive prices Suppose for example that you invested the same amount of money every month into the same investments One month your money could buy more shares when the price of the investment is down meaning you re automatically a savvy enough investor to take advantage of price drops While your money will buy fewer shares when the price of the investment is up your overall investment holdings will benefit from the increase in price Buying low and selling high sounds like a thrilling way to invest But in the long run you re better off by following a consistent investment strategy and taking a long term perspective It s time in the market rather than timing the market that helps keep portfolio returns moving in the right direction over time This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor",1,,,0.0,0

I am interested in buying a flat above a shop but have been told it would
have to be a cash purchase because the property is on a floating freehold.
What does this mean? Jane Harrison at mortgage broker London & Country says:
Floating freehold probably refers just to the flat. Normally, a flat like
this would be leasehold and covered by insurance and maintenance agreements
that included the rest of the building. Agents sometimes refer to flying
freeholds. This means part of the property is built above land that is not
part of the freehold, such as a bedroom built above a shared passageway.



Either way, lenders are not keen to provide mortgages because of the risk
from actions by the downstairs freeholder. To find a mortgage, your best bet
is to shop around, particularly among local lenders who may be more willing
to help. Remember, mortgage problems may make it difficult to resell the
property later.

But not everyone is so sure they will be joining for the right reasons.   There is a widespread belief that a government bribe to join the scheme announced in the Budget and designed to make New Zealanders save money may make people sign up but won t make them save The horror scenario for fund managers such as AMP is of people signing up then taking a perpetual contributions holiday until they can claim the government money when they retire Similarly young people might join to get a first home subsidy and once they have what they want leave the minimum in their account That would go nowhere towards creating a savings culture but would leave fund managers managing hundreds of thousands of accounts containing very little says Roger Perry general manager for savings and investments at AMP Financial Services For that to be economic Perry says the government would have to let fund managers drop service levels for small accounts for example not sending out annual statements But he was adamant KiwiSaver could be made to work Others are less optimistic Financial planner Jeff Matthews of Spicers doubts that KiwiSaver will have any effect on New Zealand savings habits And worse there is the threat of substitution people switching out of other savings plans into the KiwiSaver scheme without taking account of which offered a better investment option The funds offered to KiwiSavers are likely to be low quality and cheap and savers who took the might be ignoring better investment options elsewhere he said In of Kiwis saved in a super fund In that had fallen to Plans to let parents save for their children s tertiary education through KiwiSaver have been shelved Instead the government is finalising details of a subsidised stand alone scheme to be unveiled this year",1,,,0.0,0

(AP) - A report issued Monday by Pennsylvania Gov.

The budget office report said the State Employees' Retirement System and the Public School Employees' Retirement System together have an unfunded liability of $41 billion. Growing pension costs could force spending cuts throughout the state budget according to the report a scenario made even worse by projections of higher spending on debt medical assistance and prisons Like an oncoming tidal wave pension costs threaten to overwhelm the general fund budget and the vital programs and services that it funds the report says The same dynamic is expected for public schools said the report which was published by Corbett s budget office Increasing pension contributions obligations will claim a greater and greater share of school district budgets crowding out funding for education whether it is direct classroom instruction sports facilities and maintenance and ultimately put pressure on districts to increase property taxes the budget office said The report says higher taxes should be off the table but reductions in prospective benefits for current employees should be considered Corbett a Republican has spoken repeatedly about his desire to address the problem which is a particular challenge because case law interpreting the state constitution has prevented curtailing pension benefits for current or retired state employees and teachers His office s report says without elaboration that the state can change components of current employees prospective benefits to conform with prior court determinations regarding deferred compensation It recounts how the problem began with the law that granted retroactive pension rate increases to state workers and teachers including even higher increases for the lawmakers That was followed by a cost of living increase for retirees and then by restructuring the state s contributions that delayed the true cost for another decade The pension systems investments were badly hammered when the technology and housing bubbles burst and they have struggled to recover A law made some structural changes including less generous benefits for new hires The state paid nearly billion into SERS and PSERS during the fiscal year that ended in June That figure is projected to pass billion next year and reach billion by SERS provides billion annually in benefits PSERS pays out billion About people are members a group that includes active employees retirees beneficiaries and others who are vested but inactive Messages seeking comment weren t immediately returned by spokespeople for the two funds and for the office of Budget Secretary Charles Zogby",0,,,0.0,0

A key element of any attempt to ""fix"" the budget is tax reform and, in that regard, the Bowles-Simpson proposal, which raises revenues by lowering rates but expanding the tax base and eliminating tax preferences, has a lot of appeal. Why does this matter to us in the retirement benefits profession Because one of the first tax preferences that will be put on the table in any budget discussion is the one for retirement savings According to EBRI the tax benefit for employment based retirement plans accounts for billion of the total budget for Even nowadays that s real money Just what is this tax benefit The big benefit is this Employers when they set money aside for a tax qualified pension plan e g a k plan or a DB plan get an immediate deduction the money grows tax free in a tax exempt trust and it is not taxed until it is distributed to the employee Why should retirement savings get this special treatment A lot of people think they shouldn t On the left there are those who assert that this tax benefit goes mainly to high margin high paid employees who don t need the favorable treatment and whose savings behavior would not change if it were eliminated On the right there are those who assert that this favorable tax treatment should be provided for all savings not just retirement savings These voices are sure to be heard in any budget based debate about the continuing utility of favorable tax treatment of retirement savings At this point when we re talking about the elimination of favorable tax treatment I think the critique from the left is the more significant one The standard counterargument has been that the current system encourages employers in order to get favorable tax treatment to provide retirement benefits to a broad cross section of employees not just the high paid That argument needs to be made again However those on the left have a point With the decline in DB plans and the prevalence of k plans it s unclear that the low paid really are receiving adequate retirement benefits under the current system Whether automatic enrollment will solve this problem remains to be seen Certainly defenders of the current system will need to produce data showing that the retirement benefits tax expenditure does benefit all employees There s a mildly subtle point here This tax expenditure like any deduction based tax expenditure generally goes to higher margin taxpayers That s a given However if the result is that retirement savings go up for everybody that the tax benefit provides employers an incentive to get everybody in a plan then it s worth it There s another point It has long been recognized that any income tax system is biased against savings Interest is just compensation for the deferral of spending If you tax interest as income which ours and other income tax systems do taxpayers will have an artificial incentive to spend rather than save The retirement savings tax benefit mitigates this effect In the current neo neo Keynesian moment saving versus spending is not favored but in the long run and in real life you need savings As all the ads keep telling us you particularly need retirement savings Of course Keynes famously said In the long run we re all dead What exactly did he know in that in we do not Michael Barry is President of the Plan Advisory Services Group a consulting group that helps financial services corpor ations with the regulatory issues facing their plan sponsor clients He has had years experience in the benefits field in law and consulting firms",1,,,1.0,1

Post-wedding financial hangovers can last longer than the champagne buzz. They can put home-buying plans on hold, strain relations with in-laws and even torpedo new marriages.    People come to their wedding thinking they have to present their station in life to the world even if they cannot afford it says Lauren Rutten a wedding photographer in South Orange N J Big cars big presents such extravagance is in our mentality now That makes it hard to put things into perspective The cost of the average American wedding and honeymoon is now pegged at to according to various surveys Even industry experts are saying Basta It really is pretty exorbitant when you see how much all the different elements of a wedding can cost says Diane Forden editor in chief of Bridal Guide You have to realize less is more Who needs the limo with the fully stocked bar and the TV Three rules help with the hard work of keeping costs in check Hold down the size of the wedding Rein in its extravagance And rethink traditional expectations That could mean excluding some cousins saying no to the five course meal and ditching extras such as favors You might consider marrying on a day other than Saturday limiting liquor options and calling upon the skills of friends and relatives To start focus on the biggest bills the ones for the party Seriously the cost of the reception site was just overwhelming says Megan Fitzpatrick a year old bride to be from Jersey City N J I really had no idea Many places she checked had a person minimum to book a Saturday reception To compensate she and her fiance kept their bridal party to six people and are having an informal family barbecue for their rehearsal dinner The rehearsal tends to get blown out of proportion and can end up becoming a mini wedding Fitzpatrick says Even with all the rented silverware and linen tent weddings are still usually less expensive than restaurants or banquet halls especially if you can plunk those poles down in a park on a beach or on a relative s well manicured lawn Whether the walls are fabric or sheetrock you will need to decorate And many couples end up shocked by their flower bill You don t need huge elaborate centerpieces on every table says Forden She suggests buying local flowers in season using hand tied bouquets and substituting candles for some centerpieces Brides can also reuse church flowers at the reception but someone has to move them or check out fruit and dried flower arrangements If your guests are artists or gardeners put their talents to use As their gift they could design decorations grow flowers for centerpieces or create banners or invitations Such personal touches make a wedding unique and can deepen your friendship in a way that just receiving a toaster can t As for food look into buffets with servers they reduce the amount of food wasted Offer a wide variety of breads and salads Or ditch the heavy meal altogether If hors d oeuvres reportedly were good enough for Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher they could be good enough for you You can have a wonderful cocktail party great music and dancing serve hors d oeuvres and cake says Forden Keep the cake to two layers and garnish it with real flowers she adds The higher the cake the more expensive and elaborate sugar flowers involve a lot of labor Eileen Monaghan vice president of the nearly member Association of Bridal Consultants says liquor bills can run hundreds of dollars past expectations unless couples are careful Instead of an open bar she suggests a select menu of wine beer and one signature drink Try to avoid those half opened bottles you will pay for every one Brides agonize over their dresses but it s never been easier to save on wedding gowns thanks to the Internet That doesn t mean you have to buy a dress online even though eBay does have a bridal section It means brides today can find out more about prices choices and designers than their mothers ever could So read the bridal magazines check out the Web sites then go to a store After you have tried on gowns and settled on a look you can hunt down and compare discounts from manufacturers stores and Web sites

BORROWERS are being warned that they can no longer rely on a mortgage broker to provide them with the cheapest home loans.","James Charles explains how to nail down the best deals as lenders keep revising and repricing their mortgages.

BORROWERS are being warned that they can no longer rely on a mortgage broker to provide them with the cheapest home loans. For years homeowners have relied on brokers to find the most affordable mortgages but the dramatic freeze on lending means that many of the best deals are now available only if you approach a bank or building society direct First time buyers and homeowners coming to the end of their existing deals are therefore being urged to explore every possibility in the pursuit of a cheap loan It could still be worth contacting a good mortgage broker especially if your circumstances are out of the ordinary but it also means checking whether you can find a better deal by approaching a lender direct As the mortgage freeze has escalated an increasing number of lenders have decided that they no longer want to deal through brokers Last week Scarborough Building Society axed all of the mortgage products that it sold through intermediaries Other high street names such as Cheltenham Gloucester still deal through brokers but they do not offer them their best rates First Direct Woolwich and the Post Office all offer competitive mortgages that are only available direct HSBC meanwhile made the headlines last week by introducing its Rate Matcher mortgage This allows borrowers coming to the end of a fixed rate deal with another lender to match their old rate for a further two years There are restrictions however Homeowners cannot borrow more than per cent of a property s value and the maximum loan is Pounds The minimum rate that the bank will match is per cent and all deals will be fixed for two years The deal is also available only to borrowers who apply direct to HSBC Analysts say that lenders have been cutting the number of deals available through brokers in an attempt to discourage borrowers In the current climate lenders who offer even vaguely competitive deals are being inundated with applications Dealing directly with the public means that banks and building societies also make more money for themselves Most brokers are paid commission for every deal that they recommend Cut out the broker and the lender keeps that cash There are a number of ways that borrowers can keep on top of what is on offer James Thorpe of HSBC says Customers can find out about the direct only deals on the market by checking newspapers websites and advertisements on television It definitely pays for customers to shop around Some price comparison websites such as Moneysupermarket com and Moneyfacts co uk allow borrowers to check out the whole market before choosing specific deals Most sites will include the criteria for the deals listed which is increasingly important as lenders reserve their best deals for customers who are considered very low risk Louise Cuming of Moneysupermarket says Lenders are cherrypicking borrowers and the best deals that you see advertised are generally only for borrowers who have squeaky clean credit records By using the search engines on price comparison websites borrowers can search for deals available to new customers with similar credit histories incomes or sizes of deposit The result is a list of the deals that are likely to be available to you The best three year fix on Moneysupermarket is per cent with Abbey The arrangement fee is Pounds and the loan is available to those borrowing up to per cent of a property s value Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds The most competitive three year fixed rate deal through London and Country the broker is from Halifax with a rate of per cent and an arrangement fee of Pounds The maximum loan to value LTV ratio is per cent Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds HSBC has a direct only deal with a discounted rate of per cent for two years The monthly repayments would be Pounds The fee is Pounds and the maximum LTV is per cent The best discounted deal from a broker is with Dunfermline Building Society which is offering a rate of per cent with a Pounds fee The maximum LTV is per cent and monthly repayments on the same Pounds loan would be Pounds Despite most of the best deals being those direct from the lenders it may still be worth asking a broker what it can offer Many of the biggest companies do not charge a fee for advice because they are paid commission if you agree a deal so you lose nothing if you walk away Melanie Bien of Savills Private Finance the broker says The cheapest deals might be direct only but there will be strict criteria Brokers can give borrowers tailored advice on the best deals available to them For example increasingly we are getting people who have been turned down by their original lender or who have a missed payment on their credit report which has adversely affected their credit ratings Whether borrowers find deals that suit their requirements through an intermediary or online the message is the same don t hang around John Postlethwaite of Punter Southall an independent financial adviser says Deals that are there one day may not be the next When you find a good deal call the lender straight away and check it is available If it is book an appointment SIMON J POPE CASE STUDY DAN PIRONTI left and his partner Karen Davies have bought a six bedroom house in Clapham South London at auction for Pounds They needed to find a mortgage quickly or risk losing the property so they turned to a broker for help Savills Private Finance found them a Bank of Scotland tracker mortgage with an interest rate of per cent Mr Pironti and Ms Davies will collect the keys less than a month after they first viewed the property Mr Pironti who works as a procurement consultant says We went straight to a broker because in my experience when you need something done quickly it pays to speak to the experts High street lenders do not always advertise all their deals so you need to speak to someone who knows the market The couple had been watching the housing market for the past six months keeping an eye on property and mortgage websites before finding their new home on an auction website It needs a fair bit of work but we are really excited about picking up the keys Mr Pironti says c Times Newspapers Ltd",1,,,0.0,0

MANY years ago, as branch manager of a large Australian bank, part of my job was to vet home loan applications.

In the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis, global interest rates and inflation have remained low by historic standards, and these low interest rates, along with low rates of projected global economic growth, have led to reductions in projected returns for most asset classes, which, in turn, have resulted in an unprecedented number of reductions in the investment return assumption used by public pension plans. Among the plans the National Association of State Retirement Administrators NASRA measured in nearly three fourths reduced their investment return assumption since fiscal year A brief from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College says such a change is generally viewed as a positive development for pension funding discipline bringing assumptions more in line with market expectations and forcing plan sponsors to increase annual required contributions However the researchers say the decline in assumed rates of return is actually due to lower assumed inflation not a lower assumed real return that is the return net of inflation In a fully indexed system where benefits fully adjust with inflation a lower inflation assumption should actually have no impact on costs however public pension plans have also changed their asset allocations resulting in a higher expected real return which lowers costs Therefore a quick assessment of these underlying assumption changes suggests that plans may have actually lowered their costs with the decline in the assumed return the brief says But public plan benefits are not fully indexed so the real value of benefits increases as the inflation expectation drops which increases plan costs The researchers explain that for a hypothetical plan where benefits fully adjust with inflation lower inflation will have no impact on the required contribution because the lower revenue produced by lower nominal returns will be offset by a decrease in initial benefits through lower wage growth and the cost of living adjustment COLA paid after retirement However the actual situation for public plans differs in two ways Benefits before and after retirement are not fully linked to inflation so they do not decline one to one with lower inflation therefore increasing the real value of benefits and increasing plan costs and public plans have shifted into riskier assets which increases their expected real return and reduces costs Public plans may seem like fully indexed systems because they provide benefits based on final earnings and offer post retirement COLAs the brief says But in reality not all benefits are based on final earnings and most COLAs are not designed to fully compensate for inflation It further explains that if all public sector workers remained with their employer until they retired their final earnings would reflect inflation and real wage growth over their work lives and their initial benefits based on final earnings would be fully indexed however of employees who vest in a pension benefit do not retire as public sector employees so they receive much lower benefits for their time in the public sector than employees who finish their career in the public sector The only way for a worker who leaves public sector employment before retirement to avoid a loss in benefits would be for the plan to base pension benefits on projected age earnings that is index earnings for inflation and real wage growth Without such indexing benefits erode in real terms and the higher the rate of inflation the larger the erosion With a lower rate of inflation the cost to the employer increases by making the deferred benefits relatively more expensive In addition the researchers say most COLAs are deliberately designed not to fully match inflation and some plans provide no COLA or only ad hoc adjustments meaning the benefits of many retirees erode in value over time with rising inflation When the inflation rate declines since the drop in benefit payouts does not fully reflect the drop in inflation costs rise At the extreme for plans without a COLA a percentage point reduction in assumed inflation produces a percentage point increase in real post retirement benefits The lack of complete indexing of both initial benefits and benefits after retirement means that a change in inflation is not a wash Instead as inflation declines real costs increase the brief explains At the same time public pension plans have also shifted their investment mix out of fixed income and into riskier asset classes with higher expected real returns which all else equal leads to lower costs as fewer contributions are required to meet future benefit obligations Using data reported under the new Government Accounting Standards Board GASB statements the researchers calculated the net effect on plan costs due to the lower inflation assumption and higher expected real return assuming a percentage point decrease in inflation and a percentage point increase in the real return They found a change in accrued liabilities and a roughly increase in employee liabilities and the associated normal costs In addition using these assumptions a plan s required contribution would increase by of payroll However lowering assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation was actually better for plans than if they did so due to a lower assumed real return because the researchers found that under a hypothetical scenario in which lower assumed returns are driven by a reduction in the assumed real return the increase in the required contribution would be over three times as high at of payroll",0,,,0.0,0

I never fully understand news events unless I know the history. I need to understand how we got here. So when George Osborne announced in his annual Budget statement a significant revision in how people access their pensions, with more details announced this week, and called it the biggest change in almost a century, I naturally had to find out what it was that happened so long ago. This took me to a place that few of us would expect to visit the Finance Act This does indeed turn out to have been an important piece of legislation For that was when full tax relief first became available on contributions made to pension schemes In other words it created a valuable incentive for saving up for one s old age It was a further step in a social revolution that had begun in when Lloyd George introduced a National Insurance scheme paid for by employees and employers alike which was in essence a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment Now I hasten to add that Osborne s pension reforms have left the system of full tax relief largely intact Employers will go on taking pension contributions from your pay before deducting tax but not National Insurance contributions But one can see that if the state was going to provide a subsidy of this size to encourage saving for retirement it must have seemed perfectly reasonable to force these savers as far as one reasonably could to use their pension pots to purchase an annuity the financial instrument that actually produces a regular income until death Otherwise there would be a strong likelihood that the state subvention would be wasted And it is this near compulsory annuitisation with its penal per cent tax penalty on spending one s pension pot as one pleases that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has swept away However the problem for which compulsory annuitisation was supposed to provide an answer remains How can the state be reasonably sure that subsidised savings for retirement are sensibly used when the moment comes In its way Osborne s answer may prove to be as significant and as long lasting as the pension clauses of the Finance Act For in his amplification of his Budget statement he repeated that guidance on pensions choices would be guaranteed and that it would be provided by independent organisations And in turn this would be funded by a levy on regulated financial services firms The Treasury also announced that an individual would have had to take advice from an impartial financial adviser regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority before a transfer could be accepted Thus compulsory annuitisation is being replaced by compulsory advice Compulsory advice This is a novel concept In the vast market for financial products there has been a glaring disparity between the power and strength of the suppliers banks insurance companies unit trust groups and the like and consumers Only wealthy consumers have been able to afford the level of advice they require if they are to make successful purchases For the pass was sold in the s and early s when the High Street banks began to sell their own financial products starting with unit trusts This meant that from then on it was no use asking your bank manager for advice He or she had a straight conflict of interest Not a moment too soon this lousy system has recently been partially dismantled Compared with all this Osborne s proposals appear excellent The same body that supervises the major suppliers of financial services would regulate the new advisory firms And the costs would be paid by the industry So far so good But there are a lot of details to be settled In particular it appears that face to face advice would be the exception rather than the rule More reliance would be placed on internet based advice and consultations by telephone This would be a pity For there is no substitute for a full and frank discussion face to face Given that Osborne would have equalled his distant predecessor at the Treasury Sir Robert Horne the architect of the Act But I cannot refrain from adding that when I sought some biographical details I discovered that Sir Robert was known as a womanising bachelor and was famously referred to by a future Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as a Scots cad a whittamsmith independent co uk",0,,,0.0,0

If you donâ€™t know the answers, youâ€™re not alone. That may go a long way toward explaining why about 19 million young Americans who should qualify for a mortgage donâ€™t have one. From racial diversity to stringent lending standards there are myriad factors keeping Millennials from becoming homeowners at the same rate that older generations did Many of these factors are outside their control Experts believe however that a lack of knowledge can be as detrimental to first time homeownership rates as a lack of resources In a recent survey of renters said they believed they would need to put down more than to secure a mortgage In reality the median down payment on a mortgage in was just California Colorado Hawaii Oregon Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Vermont tied for the highest median down payments in the country at People don t consider themselves homeownership candidates when in fact they are says Laurie Goodman co director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute Even in areas of the country where it is much cheaper to buy than to rent people think I can t afford to buy because they don t have the necessary down payment Whereas in fact given where down payments actually are they do It s a huge deterrent What accounts for this misunderstanding For one low down payments are a relatively new phenomenon In just before the housing bubble burst the median down payment was Additionally a home buyer who put down less than often needs to buy private mortgage insurance which protects the lender not the homeowner in the event of default and costs between and of the loan amount each year To be clear all else being equal a higher down payment is better When interest rates are low as they are now it may pencil out to pay for mortgage insurance But the math gets harder to justify if you are taking out a mortgage when rates are high You may be charged a higher interest rate if you put down less than since some lenders view lower equity loans as riskier Starting with more equity gives both you and your lender some security if home values fall But building equity is also a key argument for why it pays to get into homeownership early even if you haven t saved of the median sale price of a home sold in April According to the Federal Reserve s Survey of Consumer Finances the average homeowner s net worth is times the average renter s The earlier you buy the more equity you can build over time You can tap into that equity for in an emergency or in your retirement My parents advice to me was real estate is basically an elevator all you have to do is get on says Justine Boucher a year old homeowner who realized she could buy a home after learning was not a requirement Here are four ways to become a homeowner without a down payment Government backed loans Borrowers with credit scores of or above can put down as little as on a Federal Housing Administration insured loan The upside is that is typically easier to qualify for an FHA loan than a conventional loan with a private lender The downside is that FHA borrowers who put down less than are on the hook for private mortgage insurance typically at a rate of until they refinance or pay off the mortgage With a private loan PMI is automatically cancelled after equity reaches of the purchases price Low down payment conventional loans With home prices climbing since lenders eventually caught on to the fact that high down payment requirements were making it difficult to attract new mortgage customers So around they began offering low down payment loans to borrowers with high credit and earning potential Like the special mortgages that have long been offered to new doctors who typically have substantial student debt and earn relatively modest salaries during residency these loans often don t require private mortgage insurance Credit score and payment size requirements vary and some programs require education for first

with GMO It s been two dozen years and counting for Inker Here are excerpts from our interview THINKADVISOR What impact will the presidential election have on the U S economy and stock market BEN INKER A government can manage to destroy an economy if it so chooses and it s possible that a sufficiently ill advised set of policies in the U S could do profound damage We now have a candidate for president who is capable of that It s very hard to know what a Trump presidency would be like but some of the things he has said would be really scary It s possible that a Trump election would be the exception to the rule that it doesn t much matter who is U S president from an investment standpoint What if Hillary Clinton is elected Whether she turned out to be a particularly good president or a particularly bad one it seems unlikely that she d do anything to change the nature of the U S economy in a profound fashion Jeremy Grantham is Are you next in line to succeed him We aren t trying to base the firm on having another Jeremy Grantham and the firm hasn t set itself up so that in order for it to succeed I must be Jeremy doesn t have any day to day responsibilities for the portfolios Over time he gave over his responsibility for the management of client assets My team and I function independently of him He comes in every day and is thinking about important investment topics that can have impact on the portfolios But I am the portfolio manager he is not Do you have lots of meetings with him and then decide how to proceed Jeremy is a member of our investment review group and we meet periodically to talk about big things that are going on But I have the end responsibility for determining what it is we re going to do Do you see any signs of a bubble occurring now The U S stock market is getting closer to two standard deviations overvalued relative to history which Grantham defines as a bubble But we aren t quite there yet Maybe when the S P is at or we could plausibly be talking about bubble levels What about a bubble in bonds It s very hard to call what s gone on in government bonds a bubble in the normal sense because bubbles are usually characterized by euphoria and very positive emotions whereas it seems anything but with regard to what s happened with bond yields What impact has Brexit had on your investing As people who are attempting to be long term investors we think the impact on the true long term fair value of most companies whose stocks are traded in the U K is just not that big a deal Nothing happened that was material enough to cause us to say We need to jump in now and do something about it Please talk about the U S dollar in light of Brexit Brexit didn t particularly cause the dollar to strengthen since part of the dollar s strength has been on the back of an assumption that the Fed was in a hiking mode whereas the rest of the world was absolutely not Brexit seemed to put Fed hikes on the table U S house prices might beat the U S equity market in the race to cause the next financial crisis Jeremy Grantham wrote in an update to his Q quarterly report Do you agree Yes you could easily see housing causing the next crisis Home prices have now made quite an impressive recovery from their post financial crisis low but are pretty expensive again Compared to stocks a home is an asset owned by a much larger swath of households for the vast majority of people it s their biggest asset and owned with a lot of leverage So you could imagine a problem in the housing market caused by a normalization of interest rates Some people will find it difficult to pay their mortgages So that could precipitate another bubble If there are continued increases in housing prices that could create another bubble and another bust The contagion of a debt fueled asset bubble housing is much worse than a cash fueled asset bubble equities It generally takes close to a generation for assets to return to bubbleness after a real bust for people to lose their memory of how painful that was But markets seem to lose their memory a lot more quickly than they used to What s your outlook for the U S stock market for the rest of this year We don t much like the U S stock market but the fact that the market is pretty expensive doesn t necessarily stop it from going up It s an overvalued market in a world where most things that are cheaper look scarier and the things that look lower risk are deeply unappealing whether cash government bonds or investment grade corporate bonds We don t think the market deserves to do particularly well So up or down slightly would be perfectly unexceptional In all the portfolios where I have an ability to express a view on the U S market my multiyear view is that U S stocks are less attractive than stocks in the rest of the world Mr Grantham wrote in his Immigration and Brexit report in July that the U S market will hang in or better at least through the election Agree The election cycle has had pretty good predictive power We re in the fourth year of an election cycle and historically with few exceptions you tend to have a modestly up and stable year So now through November if history is a guide that s the best guess If you own the cheaper stuff you ll eventually win Why is the U S market trading at a significant premium to that of the rest of the world A big part of it is that the U S seems safer The presidential election aside bearing in mind what I said about a Trump election being the notable exception somehow the political risks seem less extreme in the U S than in some other places The economy here is doing better The market has done better People have trouble imaging the U S losing because it has won for a long enough time When the U S does lose again which will inevitably happen sooner than later it s going to come as a nasty shock because right now people have trouble imagining it What do you forecast for earnings growth in the U S Over the next several years the U S should struggle to see much earnings growth and profits might well shrink a bit If the U S grows sustainably from here it s probably going to be on the back of household incomes and therefore wages growing faster than the overall economy which means falling profit margins What if the economy is weak There will probably be falling profit margins on the back of falling sales So the good news would be gently falling earnings as rising revenues are slightly more than countered by falling sales margins The bad case would be a recession where profits would fall more sharply What s your outlook for bonds If something happens that causes inflation to be a lot higher or a lot lower than expected that can give you either a wonderful windfall gain or blow a nasty hole in your portfolio that takes a long time to dissipate Your thoughts about high yield junk bonds High yield bonds are probably worth a place in your portfolio today But we owned more high yields this winter and spring than we do now Yields have gotten to quite attractive levels but a real concern is that though investors are probably getting close to adequately paid for default risk they re not getting paid very well because high yield bonds have become very illiquid assets So what specifically are the implications We as a firm have concerns that we might well be at the start of a default cycle Trailing month defaults in high yields in the U S have now peaked above the long term average A lot of that has to do with energy and mining We ve seen very few events in history where we ve had a move up through the long term average level that immediately went back down and things were safe for high yield investors So we ve got some concern that the next few years might be bad from a default level perspective How are high yield bonds priced compared to Treasuries No worse than Treasuries in the event of a bad outcome and better in the event of something better than that You ve been overweight emerging markets What s your take now If you talk to investors about emerging markets in general you get eye rolls head shakes and Oh man we ve lost so much money It s hard to imagine emerging markets turning around People have very low expectations for this asset class And when people have very low expectations for asset classes good things can happen Is that the situation right now Our head of emerging markets has long said that the real money there isn t made when things go to from good to great but when they go from absolutely horrible to merely terrible So we re happy holders of emerging market equities today because they re priced for pretty bad things and bad things aren t happening Looking at Brazil it doesn t seem like there s been a positive headline about it this year But the Brazilian stock market has been just about the best performing stock market in the world What significance does that example have to GMO For quite a while we ve had complaints from our clients that emerging can do well only when the emerging economics are firing on all cylinders and that in the absence of that emerging is doomed to lose We don t believe this Again when expectations are really bad you can get very good returns when merely less horrible things come to be Do you see less horrible things in the offing It hardly takes a stretch of the imagination to think so We believe emerging markets are priced at a level where if that happens they can perform They deserve to make money in real terms which is exciting in a world where so many assets are priced not to give returns over and above inflation Any downside to emerging markets We re still quite worried about the aggregate amount of credit growth in emerging across the last five or six years We re still seeing that certainly in China But all else equal I d rather have a cheap market with everybody convinced that nothing good can happen than an expensive market where everybody is convinced all it can do is go up Please talk a bit more about China Growth in China is worrying The question is Can you find stuff to own there that s relatively safe even in the event of a credit induced problem or possibly is cheap enough that even if it isn t safe in a credit induced problem the expectations are so bad for it that it will do OK Despite our concerns about the economy there s stuff worth owning in China Broadly in what market sectors do you see opportunity We re not primarily sector people but what s definitely striking today is sector valuations variance in different regions of the world That seems to have a lot to do with how comfortable people are with the local economy Can you talk specifics In the emerging world where people don t have particularly high expectations for growth or in Europe some of the more cyclical sectors such as consumer durables and industrials look pretty cheap In the U S where the economy has been fine for a long time and expectations seem to be that it will continue to be we still like some of the more defensive sectors though consumer non durables have done very well and some of the consumer product companies do look pretty fully valued What are your thoughts about oil Our best guess is that there isn t currently enough investment in energy production to meet the world s oil needs for the next four or five years So reasonably one could see the price of oil creeping up over that period As you look longer than that oil whose overwhelming use is as a transportation fuel has a meaningful risk of being kind of pushed aside in favor of electric transportation It s hard to know exactly whether that s going to be a big deal in the s or not But it s certainly a risk Back to Brexit How will Britain s leaving the European Union affect the U S dollar long term Even if Brexit does not have long term impact on the British economy one presumes the likelihood of a recession in the U K during this period is reasonably high and they re not going to raise interest rates into that So the U S dollar might be looking for an excuse to stay expensive or get more expensive I m more confident that seven years from now the dollar should be cheaper than it is than I am that a year or two from now it will have gone down not up Related on ThinkAdvisor GMO s Grantham Why the Stock Market Won t Collapse This Year Reasons Not to Dump Emerging

504,MoneyTips,MoneyTips You ve made some life decisions that you ve regretted and some of those decisions surely involve money What sort of money mistakes have you made Don t be shy about admitting your financial mistakes According to the latest version of Finder com s annual America s Biggest Money Mistakes survey you have million fellow Americans to keep you company More than three quarters of respondents claimed to have made a money mistake in their lifetime We re surprised that number isn t closer to As Finder com Consumer Advocate Jennifer McDermott says It s understandable that so many have made a money mistake in our lifetime we re only human However while a slip up doesn t need to derail our entire financial wellbeing it s important to recognize the triggers to make better choices in the future What s the most cited financial mistake By far the winner was spending too much money on fun activities such as shopping vacations or dining out Almost of respondents claimed this financial error Blowing too much on fun is the number one money mistake Americans are making It s easy when you re swept up in the moment to only listen to what makes us feel good right there and then whether that s a new dress another drink or booking a last minute vacay empathizes McDermott However it s important to assess how you re likely to feel after spending that amount of money Will it still seem like a good idea when the credit card bill arrives Women were more likely to admit this overspending at compared to of men Are men more unwilling to admit financial mistakes in general Truth be told there was only a one percentage point difference between men and women who admitted past financial mistakes for women for men Even so there are some insightful differences in the types of mistake claimed more by either sex Along with overspending women were also more likely to regret letting their partner control the family finances to for men The categories where men had much greater regrets than women suggest tendencies for riskier behavior Almost one quarter of men surveyed regretted making a bad investment compared to only of women In addition of male respondents reported too much gambling as a fiscal error compared to only of female respondents Perhaps testosterone trumps proper risk assessment Men and women reported the second largest financial regret at about the same rate of women and of men regretted dropping out of college It s fair to call dropping out a financial regret based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS As of college dropouts earned a median wage of per week well below the median of for all workers Those with bachelor s degrees had a median weekly salary of Unemployment rates show a similar pattern for college dropouts for those with bachelor s degrees The number of people naming dropping out of college as a money mistake shows there s a need for greater discussion about career pathways For those yet to attend it s worth taking some time to research and determine your options before locking in your major suggests McDermott This may come in the form of a gap year or entering into the world of internships both of these can inform your decision and help you decide what industry is right There s no rush Doing this could save you a lot in the student debt you accumulate by dropping out without earning a degree The survey found some generational differences but perhaps not as much as you might expect Millennials and Generation X ers were almost equally likely to admit financial mistakes to respectively Baby boomers were least likely to admit a money mistake at a questionable number because baby boomers have had more time to make financial mistakes than the other generations Individual money mistakes were a bit more predictable along generational lines Millennials were far more likely to admit overspending on fun activities than generation X ers and baby boomers Baby Boomers were more likely to regret bad investments compared to generation X ers and millennials Other financial regrets include overpaying for a wedding getting caught in an online scam and having children It s odd to consider having children as a financial regret because we d like to think that your investment in a child isn t for financial payback Still the average cost of raising a child born in through the age of is estimated at over according to a report released by the U S Department of Agriculture and that value probably hasn t been decreasing So you ve made some mistakes with your money Who hasn t Outside of the nearly one quarter of respondents whom we believe simply won t admit it The real point is that you learn from those mistakes and don t repeat them If you continue to make money mistakes eventually you won t

The 62-year-old, who studied music as well as philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, has spent the past decade in charge of investment at the UK's largest pension fund, the Â£67bn Universities Superannuation Scheme. He announced in February that he would retire, a decision that took effect at the end of last month. One could forgive Gray for wanting a little downtime It has not been a small job His tenure has been marked by the aftermath of the financial crisis the eurozone s near meltdown ballooning liabilities and years of sound and fury over cuts to academics pensions At the same time USS has more than doubled its investment staff shifted billions out of stocks and begun snapping up direct ownership stakes in national trophy assets like Heathrow Airport and Thames Water the country s largest water utility Against a fraught backdrop USS s investments have performed well Over the years to March the scheme has returned almost a year on average net of all costs in comparison with a target of a year We have had a pretty good run is how Gray sums up his team s performance It is a typical answer Temperamentally Gray is extremely zen With an ever present genial smile he seems to analyse questions from every angle before replying It has been a busy decade Unlike many the fund manages most of its money in house and the number of investment staff has gone from to It has added new capabilities in credit and emerging markets and formed a specialist strategy team But it is in off market private or alternative investments that Gray leaves his most transformational legacy Pension funds elevated appetite for these assets usually purchased through private equity and infrastructure funds is well known But USS has been at the forefront of UK funds bid to emulate the Canadian model named after the DIY approach pioneered by several of the country s large pension funds Like them USS operates in private markets on more equal terms with the likes of KKR and Blackstone either by investing alongside private equity companies or seeking to source and buy assets for themselves Gray does not pretend this has been easy He says We have gone up a learning curve Take the way people acquire assets in private markets There are quite a lot of assets that come up in auction processes and we have been singularly unsuccessful in auction processes because there is always someone who is willing to pay more than we are Instead USS has had to spend time and money on creating its own deal sourcing team people who have the contacts to bring in deals ahead of the competition The private markets group is quite lawyer intensive Gray observes All of this presumably comes at a price but the scheme says its investment costs amount to of its assets down from in USS s assets have also grown substantially from bn to bn during Gray s tenure That can support a few extra lawyers Critics of USS s investment approach and as the UK s largest pension fund it has many say the scheme is overly cautious They claim it took too long to shift money out of equities and into the bond heavy liability matching strategies adopted by most of the private sector and the result is a bn deficit and cuts in the offing for academics pensions The scheme does have around of its assets today in liability matching index linked gilts and another in lower risk bonds and credit Gray also says the scheme s return has outpaced the a year growth of a model portfolio meant to track its liabilities stating If we had put it all in gilts that is roughly what we would have got But most of the fiery debate around USS is not quite in Gray s remit Pension liabilities have been blown out to tremendous proportions chiefly by two things the fact that we are all living longer and the slump in long term interest rates and bond yields Most defined benefit pensions in the private sector have responded simply by closing their doors In university bosses said they would like to do the same but their scheme is jointly run by university employers and unions and the latter are fiercely opposed Who should pay up to close the scheme s deficit academics or universities is an increasingly bitter wrangle Academics walked out on strike in February and unions have threatened further action this autumn Investing in private assets particularly infrastructure also comes with risk How comfortable is Gray with USS s stake in Thames Water acquired in given the UK opposition Labour Party s plans to nationalise the sector It does put some limit on how much of these regulated assets you want to own in the UK he concedes It had us scratching our heads more than it might have done several years ago I think it would be rather sad if large UK long term investors were deterred from investing in UK infrastructure READ Labour to fight nationalisation battles in court Gray can claim a job well done on diversifying the scheme s investments He joined with a brief to expand USS s alternatives portfolio from to and it is currently sitting around There is one notable exception Back in a key plank of USS s diversification strategy was to put at least of its money even then more than bn into hedge funds It has not worked out that way Gray says this is now less than even after efforts to secure more favourable terms We have done a number of things he says including negotiating the typical management and performance fee structure to somewhere around and respectively What is next for Roger Gray I ask I haven t really been entertaining any conversations about what to do next he muses I anticipate dividing my time There will be something that is food for my soul I think I will take up the oboe

A THATCHED cottage in Dorset; four secluded acres and a hammock; fruit trees, chickens and berries straight from the bush. It's a goal that spurs many a jaded city dweller through a working day.   ","Alison Gibson on a couple with a sizeable windfall to invest after selling their idyllic thatched cottage.   

A THATCHED cottage in Dorset; four secluded acres and a hammock; fruit trees, chickens and berries straight from the bush. It's a goal that spurs many a jaded city dweller through a working day.    Michael Smith the owner of just such an idyllic haven confirms that the day you buy a thatched cottage can be one of the best days of your life The other high point apparently is when you sell After years in pastoral paradise Michael and his wife Janet began to yearn for the simple pleasures of life on a modern housing estate Michael an electrical officer in the Merchant Navy says When I am drinking wine in the garden on a sunny day I wouldn t swap my cottage for anywhere in the world But after mowing the grass for five hours the feeling pales And when it rains I may as well be in a Barratt house The high cost of maintenance is the main reason why Michael and Janet have decided to sell and move to an ordinary three bedroom bungalow The sale will also increase their disposable income In the cottage cost Pounds Extensive repairs have helped to boost its value to Pounds The bungalow is costing Pounds leaving Michael and Janet with a Pounds profit Michael says I see no reason to wait for property prices to rise further At the end of the day I have only got one stomach Of the Pounds windfall Pounds will be spent on modernising their new home Michael would like to use the remaining Pounds to fund an early retirement But Janet is having none of it he says She sees me as a young man and thinks I should work into my sixties Michael earns Pounds gross while Janet a part time classroom assistant earns Pounds They have a nine year old daughter Lucy The Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund a final salary scheme will pay Michael Pounds a year from age Janet does not have any pension provision beyond the state pension We would like to invest the Pounds to boost our eventual retirement income Michael says I would like a spread of risk A maturing endowment with Standard Life paid off their mortgage last year They were persuaded to start a new investment of Pounds a month in Standard Life s Global Advantage Fund They can afford to save a further Pounds a month and have Pounds in a savings account with Portman Building Society We asked a panel of financial advisers where they thought Michael and Janet should invest their windfall WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY Mark Dampier head of research Hargreaves Lansdown Michael and Janet should keep most of their money in cash until they have settled into their new home This gives them flexibility and they can always invest later There are two things that they need to do before they tie up any money in long term investments The first is to work out a detailed budget so that they have a better idea of how much retirement income they will need The second is to properly assess their attitude to risk Many investors say low risk when they really mean no risk They should seek the services of an independent financial adviser Avoid tied advisers such as the one from Standard Life because they can only advise on their company s products They are also unlikely to provide lifestyle type planning While considering the relatively short term goal of retiring in seven years time they should also work on the basis that they will want capital growth and income for another years Simply putting the entire amount in the building society and living off the interest is not a particularly great long term plan I would earmark Pounds for UK equity income funds such as Artemis Income Liontrust Income Invesco Perpetual Income Framlington Equity Income Credit Suisse Alpha Income and Jupiter Income I would put a further Pounds into distribution funds that combine both fixed interest and equities such as New Star and Invesco Perpetual and Pounds in three investment trusts I would keep the remaining Pounds in cash accounts using cash mini Isas first and then an ordinary account such as the ING Direct account Anna Bowes investment manager Chase de Vere I agree with Janet If Michael were to retire early they would probably struggle financially both now and in the future Everyone should keep some money in cash for emergencies and short term expenses but as you near retirement cash holdings should be increased I would put the extra Pounds a month into cash savings The Portman does not pay the best rates but there is always the chance of a demutualisation windfall Turning to investment a low risk portfolio would suggest that they invest heavily into fixed interest cash and property with a far smaller proportion in stocks and shares A division to consider would be per cent cash per cent fixed interest per cent property and per cent UK equities A slightly higher risk portfolio would make tactical sense because the price of equities is comparatively low at the moment I would therefore consider equity investments of per cent UK per cent US per cent European and per cent Far East The rest could be per cent cash per cent fixed interest and per cent property It is important to review a portfolio annually Standard Life Global Advantage is a mediocre performer Their holding could be transferred at no charge perhaps to Standard Life s Corporate Bond fund Brian Dennehy managing director Dennehy Weller Co It is perfectly understandable that Michael and Janet wish to be cautious Their capital is particularly valuable because it is earmarked for a key purpose retirement income in as few as seven years Furthermore the investment and economic background is fragile and will remain so for years to come The older you are the less risk you should take on I believe that the lower risk portion of a portfolio should be equal to your age in this case per cent Michael and Janet may feel more comfortable with per cent The other per cent could be a mix of medium risk such as UK equity income funds and high risk such as smaller companies or the Far East However I would prefer an investment period of no less than ten years for the Far East Rachel Faulkner pensions strategist Torquil Clark Michael should take into consideration that penalties could apply if he took pension benefits from his scheme before the normal retirement date He should obtain details He does not seem to be aware that he is likely to receive a tax free lump sum at retirement It is normally advisable to take this option and reinvest tax efficiently However this depends on personal circumstances Do not forget about the state pension A forecast of benefits can be obtained by completing a BR form available from www thepensionservice gov uk I do not see much point in putting the property windfall into pensions They are close to retirement and may even retire early Remember to invest in Janet s name too because she is the lower earner LINKS Hargreaves Lansdown www hargreaveslansdown co uk Torquil Clark www tqonline co uk Chase de Vere Financial Solutions www chasedevere co uk Dennehy Weller Co www dwcifa com MICHAEL S RESPONSE I am so glad I wrote in I did not expect to receive so much in depth advice There is a lot to mull over I realise that I should probably leave high risk investments alone I also need to do a lot of research before I invest and I need to understand pensions better The comments about the Standard Life fund confirm my disappointment The return so far has been pathetic I am glad we did not put in half as much as the salesman wanted We are looking forward to the move I have seen the world but Janet wants to travel and we will be able to afford it now I have already bought a snooker cue and taken up water skiing We will have more time and money to go out and do things together as a family We ve had a great time at the cottage but life is increasingly expensive You cannot live comfortably in a thatched cottage on Pounds a year and I do not want to live beyond my means Everyone says I am mad to leave Then again they said I was mad when I bought it c

Holly Black looks at the pros and cons

Once upon a time there was just cash or shares. More racy types of investment were allowed only in specialist products, usually reserved for the well-off. Then, in April 2016, a new type of Isa came along that allowed investors to tap into a different, dynamic part of the financial sector. The Innovative Finance IF Isa allows individuals to invest in peer to peer P P loans through the account and earn higher rates of interest than are available on the high street A P P loan is an investment where an individual lends money to another person or a business through a middleman service In return they are paid a set rate of interest for the duration of the loan and promised the return of their initial investment at the end Such investments have grown in popularity since the financial crisis because interest rates on bank and building society accounts have been so low As a result savers have had to look elsewhere for a decent return on their money The attraction of investing in P P loans is that the regular interest payments at higher rates mean you should get a more reliable return than if you invested in the stock market which can be volatile However sceptics point out that because this is a relatively new type of investment it is not yet clear how safe it is or what will happen in a recession should the number of borrowers defaulting on their loans start to ramp up Some P P providers have a safeguard fund which is designed to pay out in the event of this happening and many also split your investment across a number of different loans and in small chunks to protect you from being over exposed to defaults This is important because losses are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme As P P lending has become more popular though the interest rates on offer have come down The market leading P P platforms Zopa and RateSetter typically pay and respectively on their standard accounts Rates can be higher if you are willing to take more chances in the pursuit of bigger returns Zopa for example offers to those who opt for its higher risk account Zopa Plus Downing Crowd a rival platform says its returns range from all the way up to Another issue is that as demand from investors outstrips that from borrowers the former may have to wait for several days or even weeks before their money is matched to a lender and they can start earning the interest A further concern is that as P P providers have grown they have become less discerning in who they lend to In its first year for example Zopa approved only of the personal loan applications it received according to the peer to peer comparison site thWay Today it approves about of applications Default rates are low but have risen among the ranks of the borrowers on the books of many P P platforms This is partly a result of slowing economic growth rising interest rates and Brexit uncertainty having a big impact on the finances of business and individuals However Julia Groves co founder of Downing Crowd thinks that all these factors make IF Isas more appealing Political uncertainty is beginning to weigh on financial markets and cash is not quite the safe haven it once was as many savers have suffered years of low interest rates and high inflation At times such as these diversification is important and that is where the IF Isa can come in The take up so far has been muted though In its first year only IF Isas were opened and m subscribed In investors put m into accounts While that was a big jump Lifetime Isas were launched in and accounts were opened in its first year with m subscribed One of the reasons for the lower demand is that the IF Isa can be a little more restrictive than other Isas You can open only one of each type of Isa in each tax year but with a stocks and shares account you should still have access to the thousands of investment funds available in the UK If you open an IF Isa with a P P provider you will have access only to the loans on that platform That reduces the chances of finding what you may see as good borrowers paying good rates and also means that you run the risk of not spreading your bets widely enough While you can transfer an existing Isa balance into an IF Isa you cannot simply move existing P P loans into another IF Isa you must start afresh with new loans in the account Furthermore if you want to move from one P P provider to another it may be that the original platform can sell the loans you hold to the new provider but this will involve a fee and will depend on which companies you deal with Neil Faulkner co founder of thWay said Peer to peer lending is very stable compared to the stock market especially when you stick to the lower risk bread and butter types of loans The biggest risk is when investors do not grasp the need to spread their money across a lot of different providers and a very large number of loans to mitigate the risk of bad debts To reduce that risk it is important to research the provider you are using and to understand what sort of borrowers are on the platform Check the difference between the interest rate the borrower pays and the rate you are paid as a lender the gap between the two will show how large a slice the provider is taking as the middle man Higher rates of interest are tempting but tend to indicate greater risk If you are cherry picking individual loans to invest in rather than choosing a provider that spreads your money make sure you do your homework on that borrower Even with this approach however you should still take on a number of different loans so you do not run the risk of losing everything should one borrower default on its debt With these individual loans those that are asset backed or secured may be less risky as there will be an asset perhaps a property that the lender can sell in the event they are facing a default",0,,,0.0,0

   (FROM THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 8/17/13) 
   By Kelly Greene 

Reverse mortgages aren't just for people struggling to keep their homes anymore. The loans also can work for well heeled retirees looking for a buffer to keep them from selling investments at the wrong time according to academic researchers And Congress last month gave a boost to the type of reverse mortgage that works best for that purpose Reverse mortgages let homeowners who are at least years old borrow against their home equity The loans don t have to be used for a specific purpose but typically are used for home modifications repairs medical expenses or home care that elderly people might not otherwise be able to afford The loan is due with interest when homeowners move out sell the home die or fail to pay property taxes or homeowner s insurance premiums The homeowner s heirs typically sell the house pay the balance and keep what is left At least households have an outstanding reverse mortgage loan according to the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association a Washington industry group In the past many financial planners recommended reverse mortgages for their clients only as a last resort because fees were relatively high as much as of the loan amount That changed a few years ago when a new product was developed by the industry and insured by the Federal Housing Administration called the HECM Saver which typically has lower upfront borrowing costs than earlier types of reverse mortgages HECM stands for home equity conversion mortgage With lower borrowing costs some planners are finding new ways to use reverse mortgages to avoid selling depressed investments or to lower tax bills Retirement is really about cash flow says Martin James a certified public accountant in Mooresville Ind Even for a person who s got their mortgage paid off it s nice to have a line of credit sitting there Earlier this year the HECM program was eyed by federal lawmakers as a financial risk to the FHA and lawmakers considered curtailing the program The bill passed by Congress is intended to give the Department of Housing and Urban Development the leeway to make changes to keep the program going probably after Oct says Peter Bell chief executive of the lenders group Interested in tapping your home as a security blanket A few things to consider Your house could be a reliable credit line If your home equity line of credit gets canceled a reverse mortgage might be a good substitute Three certified financial planners at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania published a paper last year in the Journal of Financial Planning that recommends using a reverse mortgage line of credit to meet retirement income needs during a big market drop rather than selling investments A few years ago we were starting to get calls from clients saying Hey my line of credit s been canceled They have plenty of resources but that was an emergency pot of money says John Salter the paper s lead author The researchers used what they called a standby reverse mortgage strategy meaning the reverse mortgage line of credit served as a source of readily available cash when retirees portfolio values dropped below the level where they could meet their goals Using a portfolio worth and a home value of among other assumptions the researchers found that using a reverse mortgage s line of credit significantly improved the chances the portfolio would last through the retiree s lifetime because it reduced the risk of having to sell investments when they had fallen in value Tapping home equity could lower tax bills Some retirees pay off their mortgages with taxable withdrawals from their k or other accounts Yet they might be able to lower their income taxes by using reverse mortgages to pay off their traditional mortgages Mr James says if they have substantial equity That means they wouldn t need to withdraw as much tax deferred retirement savings which are subject to income tax and can bump retirees into higher tax brackets Plus without investment distributions needed to make mortgage payments they might be able to keep their overall incomes under the income threshold at which Social Security retirement benefits are taxed Mr James says Consult an expert Before you start talking to lenders consider getting advice from a reverse mortgage counselor certified by HUD to learn more about the options and mechanics The National Council on Aging and other nonprofit groups sometimes offer such counseling Keep the kids in the loop When Mr James broaches the idea of a reverse mortgage with clients the first thing they do is wrinkle their nose he says One big reason Many parents want to leave their home often their biggest asset to their children as their inheritance Still he contends that many adult children don t really want the house and that they are eager for their parents to use their assets to have a better rest of their life Using a reverse mortgage allows for a little more diversification meaning retirees could leave other investments with potential for better returns to their families Mr James says Email familyvalue wsj com END Dow Jones Newswires August ET GMT",1,,,0.0,0

For Bogaczyk, 56, the decision to keep Gene, now 68, at home in Upland has had major consequences. After years of shuttling him to adult day care and having to leave work in the middle of the day to attend to his needs, Bogaczyk decided the logistics of caring for him were just too much. So she quit her job as a special-education aide at the Fontana Unified School District to devote herself full time to Gene. That lost us quite a bit of money she says To make matters worse Bogaczyk s husband Thomas had to stop working a year ago because of degenerative arthritis forcing the family to deplete his k to cover living expenses And while Medicare pays the daily fee at Gene s day care center and the couple s adult son and daughter help out with rent money is tight and retirement is an afterthought It s frightening says Bogaczyk who frets about the day that she herself could fall ill We don t have that problem yet but that s not to say we won t have it As the baby boom generation born after World War II ages and their parents live longer Bogaczyk s dilemma is echoed in some form in nearly every family faced with securing long term care for an aging relative without sidelining its own retirement plans Rhonda Papell a homemaker in Brentwood found herself thrown a year ago into the role of caregiver for an estranged mother in law with extreme dementia This is someone we didn t have a relationship with Now she is basically my job Papell spends much of her time managing a stream of complicated medical billing for her mother in law and wondering how she and her husband will continue paying the a month board and care bill after the mother in law s money runs out Rochelle Mallen a homemaker in Encino felt it necessary to hire a full time live in caregiver for her year old father David even though he is mobile and sharp as a tack Before the bear market set in pressure was substantial on working people of the sandwich generation those caught between caring for aging parents and saving for their kids college funds Now in addition to all that these sandwichers are having to factor severely contracted retirement portfolios into the equation And that is proving a bitter pill to swallow Retirement plus It s like retirement plus says Jason Karpf a marketing manager in Chatsworth who is juggling retirement planning for his mother saving for college for his own two grade school children plus planning his own retirement You have to put yourself on a financial discipline says Karpf It s like a diet Karpf was very involved in helping to manage his grandfather s entrance into a rest home for Alzheimer s patients and he learned from that experience how difficult financing such care can be even when the patient has planned well He had a healthy fixed income but all of it was quickly consumed It was quite a financial balancing act to make sure all the right choices were made says Karpf And while his own mother is in decent shape with a pension from the Writers Guild and access to the Motion Picture Television Fund s retirement home in Woodland Hills Karpf worries about financing the unexpected You can only plan so much he says Even in situations where the elderly themselves are paying for their own long term care the management of that care can become a full time job with serious financial ramifications for the relative who takes it on People are quitting their jobs to give the care then they lose their own health benefits says Bonnie Lawrence communications manager at Family Caregiver Alliance a state nonprofit that helps overwhelmed caregivers manage the dizzying elder care system A survey by the FCA found that percent of people helping to care for an elderly relative had quit their job to provide care and percent had reduced their work hours It causes an economic ripple through the system says state Sen Sheila Kuehl D Los Angeles who introduced a bill signed into law last month that would allow employees in California up to six weeks paid leave to attend to the needs of children spouses or elderly relatives facing debilitating conditions or requiring other care In addition the California Legislature pushed through a tax credit in to help cover the cost of such long term care But that s cold comfort when long term care insurance premiums can approach that amount for a couple in one month The basic categories of long term elder care include in home care by a registered nurse which can cost more than a month depending on how it is billed nursing homes which fall in terms of level of care somewhere between assisted living and a hospital a month and assisted living and retirement homes plus monthly In addition to these full time options there are various forms of part time care such as adult day care centers a day popular with elderly people cohabitating with a family caregiver There is also a growing trend with California at the forefront of keeping the elderly in their own homes and delivering services like cleaning or grocery shopping on an ad hoc basis Some of these services are covered by government programs for seniors with few or no private assets But a lot of it comes out of the pockets of the elderly themselves and their children Of billion spent on elder care in the latest figures available billion came from private pockets versus billion from federal and state coffers according to a Family Caregiver Alliance survey of resource centers including two in Colton and Los Angeles tag f Helvetica f b f i s w l tag Pinched and sandwiched off tag l tag off The owners of those pockets are fully aware of their unenviable situation They are pinched and they are sandwiched says Nancy Wexler a geriatric care manager in Tarzana who helps place and monitor seniors who need elder care services They are also usually surprised at the high cost of services and how few assets a senior must have to qualify for government coverage I once asked a social worker about families and sticker shock says Anne Burns Johnson president of the California Association of Homes and Services for the Aging She said that the first time they begin to explore elder care services they are horrified by the cost Then they get called to the emergency room five times in a month and that s Making decisions about elder care is hardest for caregivers helping middle income elderly people those who make too much to qualify for state or federal programs but not enough to pay out of pocket for top quality assisted living centers or professional home care for extended periods of time Medicare does fine with people in hospitals but it doesn t do anything for long term care unless people are penniless says Frank Weber an estate planner in West Covina So where does that leave adult children of elderly people with expensive long term needs Elder care consultants urge planning as the only way to avoid financial havoc brought on by an aging parent with expensive needs and no assets But they also say most clients they see are not well prepared and don t realize they cannot count on government programs to provide long term health care Our society is not prepared for the impact of having an elder who needs care says Carol Goldman a geriatric care manager at Caremanagement Services in Long Beach They don t have nearly the information or education they need They re like Oh my God this is happening can you help First folks over with or more in assets should look into long term health care insurance which has only been around for about a decade says Joseph Solomon an elder care planner in Los Angeles Premiums aren t cheap around a year for a year old but the benefits aren t usually limited to specific services and the cost of the premiums is tax deductible But as with any kind of insurance reading between the lines is crucial Goldman an expert in the field says she was surprised to discover that a long term care policy her father in law had only covered him for two years An alternative or supplement to long term care insurance is to put assets into a fixed income annuity that is Medi Cal friendly meaning a monthly annuity payment that doesn t affect Medi Cal coverage for a nursing home says Solomon For folks who are house rich and cash poor the best bet is taking a reverse mortgage on the house then putting that into a fixed income annuity creating a guaranteed long term payout Whatever option people do choose to care for their elders they must choose something and plan ahead for it You have to do it for your children and your grandchildren says Karpf the marketing manager in Chatsworth It s your final act of love toward them dlim end",0,,,0.0,0

A five-year performance comparison shows value managers have beaten the rest of the funds. There are many different ways of measuring the strength of fund managers returns assets and risk to name but a few One theme that often comes up is the question of style and what that comes down to is the matter of value versus growth Value managers are those who buy stocks that appear to be undervalued in the belief that they will turn around and reflect their true value Growth involves buying stocks that you think will go up even if they re fairly or overvalued now There are various in between styles growth at a reasonable price neutral core but most mainstream styles fall somewhere on a spectrum between these two poles The two years of soaring markets from March to March were ideal for a growth manager in that most things went up and continued to do so long after value managers could no longer see anything that warranted buying So it s interesting to note that when prominent research group Morningstar last week printed a study of Australian large cap share fund managers most of the top ranked ones were value managers and the bottom ranked ones were growth Specifically five of the managers deserved the highly recommended ranking They are BGI GMO Investors Mutual Perennial Value and Perpetual Investments All of them bar BGI which Morningstar calls a blend style are value investors The lowest grade Morningstar gave to any manager was hold which it conferred on Axa HSBC Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch All but HSBC are growth styled managers Why does value win Well partly because Morningstar isn t just evaluating the past two years it s looking back over the past five and that includes a bear market In terms of capital preservation value managers fared much better at protecting investors capital in falling markets says Morningstar On average this group produced a per cent return in compared with a minus per cent average return from growth managers Morningstar sees two other reasons First value stocks outperformed growth stocks Specifically after the tech stock bubble burst in March investors shifted to defensive stocks which had been left undervalued as the herd piled into technology stocks As a result prices of defensive stocks rose and defensive stocks were where value styled investors had put their money Secondly smaller cap stocks have done better than large cap stocks in four of the past five years and value managers tend to have a higher exposure to mid caps Nevertheless Morningstar adds a caution While style and size factors have helped value style managers deliver competitive returns the free ride that value has enjoyed appears to be over Morningstar thinks that in a future choppy market returns are going to come down to good stock selection no matter what the style of the manager",0,,,0.0,0

A private attorney representing the agency declined comment late Thursday because the case involves pending litigation and personnel matters for law enforcement officers.

A recent survey of 1000 non-retired US investors found that 85 per cent expected to continue to work to some degree after ""retirement"", according to MoneyOnline in a recent newsletter.   This is partly for social reasons Retirement is a spectator sport I don t want to sit there and watch the world go by I liked being in the game says someone quoted in the article But gradual retirement also has a bigger impact than you might expect on how much you need to save for retirement If you ve worked through one of those depressing calculators that says you ll need to save about half your current income from now on if you want even a meagre retirement income read on In an example in the newsletter a single year old with no savings is planning to stop full time work at Her life expectancy is After she wants after tax income of a year from all sources including NZ Super currently almost a year after tax for singles Here are the three scenarios If she stopped all work at she would need to accumulate by then which requires her to save a month until she turns If she earned after tax each year from to she would need to accumulate only saving at a month And if she earned after tax a year from to she would need to accumulate only much less than half the original amount and save only a month That sounds so much more manageable And it s based on reasonable assumptions One is that NZ Super payments will keep pace with inflation Currently they grow with wages a bit faster than inflation Another is that the woman will use up all her savings if she lives to which is five years past her life expectancy A third assumption is that investment returns will be per cent a year after tax and inflation Nobody can be sure of course that they will find work after age Many a laid off person in their s has reported widespread age discrimination in employment But we re not talking high pay here Many retired people could somehow earn or a year Another worry is that health problems might prevent you from working But if that s the case it s quite likely you wont live as long as you expect in retirement so you won t need as much in savings she says cheerfully The newsletter also ran through the same example but assuming NZ Super is halved to a year Here are the results With no retirement work our woman would have to save or a month With income of from age to she would have to save or a month With income of she would have to save or a month Again it s a huge difference By the way the newsletter also reports on an American study that found the most powerful predictor of life satisfaction right after retirement was not health or wealth but the breadth of a person s social network Obviously its good to have friends beyond the workplace Mary Holm is a seminar presenter author of Investing Made Simple and publisher of Holm Truths a quarterly newsletter for employees clients and superannuation scheme members She can be reached at maryh pl net",1,,,1.0,1

New research by the Brotherhood of St Laurence and Nous Group shines a light on an issue so far overlooked: the impact of COVID-19 on mature-age, low-income people who were already disadvantaged. Our report, Hidden in plain sight, presents the evidence base for the problem and shows the impact of potential policy solutions by national, state and territory governments. The crisis is compounding vulnerabilities among older people often entrenching these existing problems Our research reveals that up to of the newly un or underemployed are aged to This means nearly Australians aged to will have their hours impacted or lose their jobs due to the economic impact of COVID Mature age workers comprise an estimated of job losses and have been hit hard because many industries that are significant employers of these workers are among those most impacted by the recession education and training retail trade accommodation and food services Governments have acted quickly to put in place social protections for the whole population as well as some vulnerable groups but mature age low income people have fallen through the cracks The current policy response provides too few targeted supports that address their needs at the same time as their livelihoods are being threatened risking shunting this group between different forms of disadvantage and increasing reliance on inadequate social security payments There are a few reasons why this group misses out For starters some programs are primarily aimed at Australians aged such as enhancements to the Community Visitors Scheme Queensland s Care Army and an Older Persons Information Line Help for these people is welcome but Australians under also require targeted measures Then there is the short term focus on the relief effort which means longer term problems are not addressed and may even be exacerbated These policies include the temporary nature of the increased rate of unemployment benefit JobSeeker moratoriums on evictions and rent increases and funding boosts to ease pressure on support systems Early access to superannuation may cause later financial strain And there is the use of existing systems and service structures to deliver COVID programs when those structures are often flawed The challenges this group faces makes it particularly vulnerable to the social health and economic impacts of COVID and associated policy responses These issues are strongly intersectional in nature particularly regarding gender Women are more likely to take time out of work or to work part time while caring for children and or other family members As a result women are at disproportionally greater risk of housing and financial stress as they age Refugees and new migrants Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and anyone facing stigma or discrimination due to disability also experience these challenges in particularly significant and complex ways Take the experience of Mary a woman in her s Having spent time out of the workforce caring for her family Mary s employment prospects as a single mature age woman are limited to low paying jobs COVID has left Mary s job in doubt and without her regular income she cannot pay her rent Her lack of superannuation or other assets means she may rely on JobSeeker but if the rate is returned to the pre COVID level she will not be able to make ends meet There is action that governments can take to help low income mature aged Australians like Mary in the aftermath of COVID Our report makes recommendations relating to social security employment supports housing and care Address discrimination experienced by mature age workers through practical reforms including better targeting of education training and upskilling opportunities improving access to careers advice for mature age workers at risk of involuntary retirement or unemployment strengthening policies that promote workplace flexibility inclusive employment and retention practices including government demonstrating leadership through public service employment policies such as the Collaborative Partnership on Mature Age Employment Ensure mainstream employment services are adequately equipped to respond to the distinct needs of mature age workers Continue and expand targeted superannuation schemes to promote greater equity within the system and economic security in retirement Ensure social security benefits remain above subsistence levels Benchmark the liquid asset test for JobSeeker against median incomes Index Commonwealth Rent Assistance CRA payments to movements in national rents to provide immediate relief from housing stress and prevent erosion of the payment Improve security of tenure for renters including by ending no cause evictions and enabling reasonable home modifications to support people to age in their communities Facilitate greater collaboration between Commonwealth state and local governments to grow social housing through a sustained investment plan Expand funding for social financial and healthcare services available to mature age and older people facing housing insecurity and or homelessness as a

Hawley Assumes Role
As Chief Executive
Of Krause Furniture
","
BREA, Calif. -- Philip M. Hawley, formerly chairman of Los
Angeles-based department store chain Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., has
been named chief executive officer of Krause Furniture Inc., a
manufacturer and retailer of sofas and convertible couches.



Mr. Hawley, 71 years old, is one of a number of investors behind the
infusion of $17 million into the furniture maker, which posted a loss in
the fiscal first quarter ended April 31. GE Capital Services, a unit of
General Electric Co., invested $10 million in Krause through the
purchase of $5 million in common stock and a $5 million loan.

 Robert G. Sharpe, executive vice president, said Krause needed the financing to turn its business around and return to profitability. He said the money will be used to pursue projects such as remodeling stores and updating furniture lines.    Thomas M. Delitto, who had been Krause's chief executive officer and vice chairman, will remain as vice chairman. Jean Perrette will step down as chairman. ",0,,,0.0,0
726,Financial Adviser: Dormant cash raid to fund teen projects.  ,"GORDON Brown's much-anticipated raid on dormant bank and building society accounts is to be used to fund youth and community facilities.  

Industry experts and the Tories had proposed using the AGBP20bn of unused funds in dormant accounts to offset part of the AGBP27bn savings gap.  
However, the chancellor said on Monday that the government had reached an agreement with the Yorkshire, Nationwide and HBoS to use the unclaimed assets to fund youth and community facilities across the UK.    Jo Roberts, director for Staffordshire-based Needanadviser.com, said the decision was a waste of money and the dormant cash could have been put to better use, plugging the pensions gap or paying for the national health service.    She said: ""The health service and pension gap is becoming increasingly stretched as people live longer. But maybe Gordon Brown has other plans to tax individuals and companies, which will bolster the health service and pensions.""    Ms Roberts said the government wanted to be seen to be doing something about today's yob culture but was sceptical that throwing money at it would work.    David Sayer, head of retail banking for London-based KPMG, said the controversial issue was that this money belonged to individuals and families. He said it was unclear what process was going to be established to ensure every effort was made to trace those who owned the money before it was distributed.    He said: ""It would seem sensible that a level be agreed at which the onus should be on finding the owners rather than requiring them to make a claim.    ""While individuals who are aware that they have deposited money are protected, we perhaps need to consider the elderly who may have lost track of their finances and bereaved families who were unaware of these assets.""    At present, the proposed definition of dormancy is accounts lying untouched for 15 years.    Adrian Coles, director general of the Building Societies Association, welcomed the government's proposals and pledged to work closely with the Treasury on identifying unclaimed assets.    He said: ""If a scheme is considered necessary to deal with the remainder, it is important that a realistic definition of dormancy is used and that smaller institutions are able to support local charities.""

The analysis conducted by Industry Super Australia and Cbus estimates at this rate unpaid super will reach $66 billion by 2024.  The report declares a compliance system filled with holes is failing to warn workers their contributions are not turning up.  “We have stories of workers who’ve put faith in the system only that their super, including extra voluntary contributions, has not been paid into their accounts and is lost completely when companies move into liquidation,” Cbus chairman Steve Bracks said.  “It is not unusual to hear from members who have lodged a complaint with the ATO still waiting for answers, let alone their money, years afterwards. “One said he was told recovery of unpaid super may take up to 10 to 20 years.”The average overall annual loss of retirement income per worker is $1489 a year.",0,,,1.0,1
755,Disabled veterans get break from property taxes,"EATON COUNTY — A new state law granting exemptions from property taxes for some disabled veterans came too late to allow most eligible veterans to avoid paying 2013 taxes. Some disabled veterans will need to pay the taxes, seek exemption retroactively and claim a refund next summer.

Public Act 161, signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder on Nov. 13, allows exemption from all property taxes for honorably discharged veterans who are 100 percent disabled, or who are deemed by the Department of Veterans Affairs as unemployable, or who receive funds from the VA for adaptive housing.
The exemption could be claimed retroactively for 2013 taxes, but to qualify, the applications had to be filed and approved by local Boards of Review, which met during the week of Dec. 10, and cannot be reopened.  However, though the bill was initiated in May, by the time it found it's way through two houses, the governor's office and then reviewed by the state Tax Commission, it was too late for all but a few veterans to act on it this year.  The State Tax Commission met Dec. 16 and issued guidance for local assessors, along with approving the forms to be used by veterans to apply for exemptions. But the commission also authorized Boards of Review meeting in July, 2014 to grant retroactive exemptions for 2013 taxes.  A draft of the form has been circulating for several weeks, and as a result some veterans groups have been seeking out and helping potentially eligible veterans.  ""We just got it the week before the BOR,"" said Delta Township and Grand Ledge Assessor Brian Thelen. ""Nobody had any time to do anything. Everybody kind of ad-libbed and put together our own.""  Thelen said seven eligible veterans in Delta Township got claims for exemption filed in time for the December Board of Review. None were filed in time to be considered by the Grand Ledge Board of Review.  Tom Lewis of the Eaton County Veterans Services office said there are an estimated 250 disabled veterans in Eaton County who could qualify for total exemptions from property taxes if they own property. Statewide, the Senate Fiscal Agency estimates as many as 8,000 veterans could qualify.  Any veteran who might qualify for exemption from 2013 property taxes must file a claim with their local assessor's office for consideration at the July, 2014 Board of Review, but that will not meet until after the taxes are due and payable.  Eaton County Treasurer Bob Robinson said the law gives him no discretion on levying interest and penalties for late taxes.  ""My recommendation is to pay the tax to avoid the potential for any interest and penalties, and then apply for a refund,"" Robinson said.  Any Eaton County veteran may contact the county Veterans Services office at (517) 543-3740 for advice and assistance.",0,,,0.0,0
760,ASK NOEL,"Noel Whittaker answers your questions

I'M 29, on a gross salary of $70,000 and have no debts apart from a $25,000 HECS debt. What should I do with a spare $10,000? I considered making a voluntary HECS repayment to benefit from the bonus (discount for upfront payment) but wonder whether I would be better to put it into super, invest it or put it into a first home saver account, although I'm not considering buying property for another few years.
My preference is for the first home saver account as you will receive a guaranteed 17 per cent tax free on the first $5500, but this is only a viable option if you intend to buy a home in the foreseeable future. Keep in mind that the home saver account must be open for four financial years before you can access your money.  My wife and I are both in our mid-50s. We work full time and have two dependent children at university. We have been putting the maximum amount allowed into our super for many years. We are conservative in our investing habits: some shares and no investment properties. We live in a modest house. However, we have also been saving outside of our super with large sums in term deposits. What investment choices do we have without being penalised by the 46.5 per cent tax on interest income?  At your age the perfect choice is to contribute the money to super as a non-concessional contribution. Earnings will then be taxed at 15 per cent and because of your age you could withdraw the money if you had to stop work. Just keep in mind that such contributions are limited to $150,000 a year or $450,000 if you contribute three years in one lump sum.  Noel Whittaker, AM, is a co-founder of Whittaker Macnaught.

774,"First it was football, now legendary coach Jim France retires as Manchester principal","Jim France has been at Manchester High School for nearly a half-century.

Indeed, nothing from his arrival in 1971 through the beginning of 2020 had been able to stop that streak.
Nothing, that is, until the COVID-19 pandemic reared its ugly head.  Citing that, and the accommodations stemming from the coronavirus that will have to be made, as the reason, France has announced his retirement, effective at the end of last week, as the school principal - a year earlier than planned.  When he retired as the school's head football coach on March 14, ending a tenure of 48 seasons that has left him as Ohio's all-time winningest coach with 401 victories, he was adamant that he would stay on at the school one more year as principal, a job he has held since 1984. This fall would have marked the beginning of his 37th school year as principal, and 50th overall after also having served as first a physical education teacher and then assistant principal.  But just as the coronavirus kept him from meeting personally with his players three months ago to tell them he was retiring as coach, it also kept him from finishing his time as principal on his schedule.  ""With this COVID thing and all the different stuff that will have to be done to deal with it when school starts up in the fall, I thing it's best if they get a younger person in here to do that,"" said France, who will turn 77 on Sept. 18.  Schools around Ohio, and for that matter around the state, aren't sure yet what that ""stuff"" is, but the implementation of whatever it turns out to be likely will not be easy. There will be a lot of learning going on, and not all of it will be by students.  ""It will be kind of sad - different - not being in that school next year. I wanted to be there, but that's just kind of the way it is,"" France said.  ""I will miss seeing the kids (some whose parents, and even grandparents, also attended Manchester while he was there). You build relationships with them. I will also miss the teachers, I worked with some of them for 20 or 30 years. You build relationships with them, too. They become your friends.""  It is not being able to say goodbye, to meet personally with those students and teachers and thank them for being part of his long journey at Manchester, that bothers him the most.  ""I really wanted to do that, but again, it's not going to be possible so you just have to deal with it,"" France said. ""I will still reach out to each and every one of the teachers, though.""  It will be one of the many things he will be doing now. He has plenty on the agenda, so the extra year will give him a head start on his retirement plans of spending even more time with his grandchildren and watching their activities, sports and otherwise; working on his garden in his back yard and on his diet with which he is already doing very well; staying active with the Ohio High School Football Coaches Association, including traveling to Columbus twice a month in his role as past president; possibly sneaking in and watching a couple Manchester football games, likely on the road so his presence won't cause a fuss; taking his successor and former assistant, new Panthers head football coach Jay Brophy, up on his invitation to stop in anytime at practice for however long he wants; and continuing to serve the church he has attended all his life, Sawyerwood United Methodist in Springfield Township, as one of the most high-profile custodians in the area.  ""I'll still be hanging around,"" France promised.  Unfortunately, though, COVID-19 will, too.",0,,,0.0,0
781,The Palm Springs Home Where Elvis and Priscilla Presley Honeymooned Asks $5.65 Million; The famous pair celebrated at the midcentury modern home following their Las Vegas wedding in 1967,"Be the first to know about the biggest and best luxury home sales and listings by signing up for our Mansion Deals email alert.

The Palm Springs, Calif., house where Elvis and Priscilla Presley spent their honeymoon is returning to market for $5.65 million following a nearly two-year renovation.
The iconic rock 'n' roll star rented the midcentury modern house for about a year starting in 1966, and he and his then-wife, Priscilla, celebrated there following their Las Vegas wedding the following year. The house is a Palm Springs landmark, long drawing tourists, Elvis fanatics and architecture lovers.  The sellers of the four-bedroom house are Seattle-based investors Dan Bridge and Paul Armitstead. Mr. Bridge, 68, said he is a rabbi who has worked in the nonprofit sector, and Mr. Armitstead, 67, is an architect who has designed apartment communities. The men are former brothers-in-law (Mr. Bridge used to be married to Mr. Armitstead's sister) and have been co-investing for several years in house revamps in Seattle and Palm Springs, Mr. Bridge said.  They first visited the property three or four years ago for an event held as part of Palm Springs' Modernism Week, an annual festival for architecture lovers, Mr. Bridge said. With its round walls and batwing-shaped roof, it reminded Mr. Bridge of a stealth bomber.  ""It looked like it was ready to take off,"" he said.  The roughly 4,700-square-foot home dates to around 1960, when it was designed by architect William Krisel, a Modernist architect known for his California tract homes, according to the Palm Springs Historic Site Preservation Board. The house essentially has no corners. Rather, its peanut-brittle-style stone walls curve around circular rooms, according to the sellers. In the living room, a roughly 60-foot-long, rounded built-in couch hugs the walls and surrounds a central fireplace. Outside, there is a pentagon-shaped pool, although the original tennis court no longer exists.  The story goes that Elvis and Priscilla Presley were set to marry at the house, but shifted their ceremony to Las Vegas after a local gossip columnist got wind of their plans. They returned to the home after the ceremony on Frank Sinatra's Learjet and Elvis carried Priscilla over the threshold singing ""The Hawaiian Wedding Song,"" according to the book, ""And the Rest Is History: The Famous (and Infamous) First Meetings of the World's Most Passionate Couples"" by Marlene Wagman- Geller. Ms. Presley's spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.  The house was built as a personal residence for home builder Bob Alexander and his family, according to the preservation board. Mr. Alexander's firm, the Alexander Construction Company, built thousands of homes in Palm Springs and was responsible for most of the modern homes in the surrounding neighborhood, which is known as Vista Las Palmas.  At the time of its completion, the house was dubbed ""The House of Tomorrow"" and seen as a harbinger of a new era in modern design, with its electronic controls to manipulate the temperature, outside lights and sprinkler systems, according to a 1962 article in ""Look"" magazine. The magazine ran a spread on Mr. Alexander and his wife, Helene Alexander, and their cutting-edge home, calling it a ""$300,000 pleasure dome that proves California has only begun to show how luxurious things can be on this planet.""  The article portrayed the Alexanders as the ultimate Palm Springs ""It"" couple,"" at a time when the area was seeing an influx of wealthy buyers from L.A. In the mornings, the story said, Ms. Alexander would spend an hour putting on her false eyelashes and mascara, then head off to the racquet club, which was popular with movie stars, for a tennis lesson, which ""firms her legs."" In the evening, it was ""parties, parties, parties."" The Alexanders died in a plane crash a few years after the home was completed.  When Messrs. Bridge and Armitstead first saw the house during Modernism Week a few years ago, it had the look of a museum stocked full of Elvis memorabilia, Mr. Bridge said. The previous owner, Boston-based investor M.L. Lewis, was an Elvis superfan and maintained the property as a kind of time capsule, offering guided tours given by docents in Elvis and Priscilla costumes.  Mr. Bridge said he and Mr. Armitstead were overwhelmed by the memorabilia but saw potential in the house. At the time, the property had been on the market since 2014 asking $9.5 million, but they thought the price was too high. After a string of price cuts, they eventually pounced, buying it for $2.6 million in December 2020, records show. They didn't even return to see it again in person, Mr. Bridge said.  The pair's decision was driven by the architecture of the home as opposed to the Elvis connection, Mr. Bridge said, noting that neither he nor Mr. Armitstead is an Elvis devotee. The Elvis memorabilia, which included furnishings and framed Elvis photographs, movie posters and costumes, was removed and auctioned by the previous owner, they said.  ""I grew up as a big soul music fan and I appreciate Elvis, but I am not an Elvis groupie,"" Mr. Bridge said.  The two embarked on a lengthy renovation, which was slowed by the city's push in 2021 to designate the home as a historic landmark. They rebuilt the kitchen, replaced the round island in the center and modernized the fixtures and finishes. They replaced the windows and cleaned the exposed-rock walls. They refurbished the built-in sofa. The lack of right angles in the home meant nearly every countertop and fixture had to be custom-made, Mr. Bridge said.  They worked with the city to secure the historic designation, which required returning the home to its original exterior color by working with the 1960s paint supplier. They removed a fifth bedroom, which had been an illegal addition, he said, and restored the carport that had been originally attached to the home.  They also tore up the pool decking because it had been poured over the original plumbing and gas lines, which had galvanized and rusted and were no longer serviceable.  Mr. Bridge said he hasn't yet tallied up the total cost of the renovation and admitted he is a little scared to do so. He said it was always the plan to sell the house once the renovation was completed.  ""Our goal in this was not to have a museum, but rather turn this into a living and breathing home for people who will live in it, not just use it as a showpiece,"" he said.

Apple and Oracle to Offer
TV Set-Top Decoder Box
","
CUPERTINO, Calif. -- Apple Computer Inc. is entering the hotly
contested market for computerized TV set-top decoder boxes, in a
partnership with software supplier Oracle Corp.



New set-top decoders are needed to deliver new entertainment and
education services such as video-on-demand and interactive shopping,
over cable and telephone lines. The two companies said the new
set-top box will be based on Apple's Macintosh computer, which uses
Apple's proprietary operating system and a microprocessor chip from
Motorola Inc. The new box will work with Oracle Media Server
software, which would be used to store and retrieve movies and other
multimedia information, the companies said.

 They said they plan to deliver the technology on a trial basis in the first half of this year. Though they provided no more details, sources close to Oracle, Redwood City, Calif., have previously disclosed that the Macintosh technology would be used by British Telecommunications PLC for a trial in the London area.

FSA tells over-50s to keep pension pot.
","
The financial services authority yesterday warned concerned
50-somethings not to be lured into cashing in their pension pots
early.



The City regulator is concerned that adverts launched by some firms
might persuade people to ""unlock"" their pensions, particularly given
the downturn in the market which could be depressing the value of their
other investments.

 The FSA has begun to investigate some firms which have already enticed up to 10,000 people over the age of 50 to cash in their pensions early but often to their long-term detriment. The financial advisers, however, often do well, charging the consumer fees and the pension provider a commission.    ""Releasing cash early may sound very tempting but you need to stop and think about whether you really need to do it. It is rarely in anyone's long term financial interests,"" said David Kenmir, director of investment firms at the FSA.    Once over the age of 50, people who have been saving for their pensions can transfer their savings in an occupational or personal pension into a new pension arrangement from which they can release their money. They can then take a tax-free lump and buy an annuity, which the FSA warns will ""substantially reduce"" their income during retirement.    ""Only in exceptional cases, where you have immediate needs and no other option, should you even consider doing it. It is an expensive way to free up extra cash and your financial adviser may well take a fee for dealing with it - meaning that part of your hard earned pension pot will benefit him rather than you,"" Mr Kenmir said.

792,S&P 500 Slips as Rising U.S. Yields Dent Growth Stocks,"By Yasin Ebrahim

Investing.com -- The S&P 500 slumped Monday, as growth sectors of the market including tech and consumer were under pressure from rising Treasury yields amid fears about Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell delivering a hawkish surprise later this week.
The S&P 500 fell 2.3%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 2.0%, or 665 points, the Nasdaq was down 2.7%.  Tech stocks struggled to shake off pressure from rising Treasury yields, the enemy of stocks that have high valuations, as investors await fresh clues on monetary policy from the Federal Reserve at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole symposium later this week.  “[A] more hawkish tone is likely to set the stage for a more aggressive rate move next month, while a softer or more dovish tone will expectedly reinvigorate hopes of a lesser sized move,” Stifel said in a note.  Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) were down more than 2%.  Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) fell more than 6% after CFRA downgraded the stock to sell from hold and cut its price target on the stock to $238 from $345 on worries that the streaming giant’s earnings will decline in the second half of the year.  Ford Motor (NYSE:F), meanwhile, dragged consumer stocks lower as the automaker was ordered to pay $1.7 billion to the family of Voncile and Melvin Hill, who were killed in a fatal rollover of a F-250 pickup truck. The automaker also said it would slash 3,000 jobs in the U.S. and Canada.  Energy was the relatively outperforming sector on the day, down about 0.5%, as oil prices recovered losses after Saudi energy minister touted the prospect of major oil producers cutting costs to ensure that oil futures price reflect the current supply and demand fundamentals.  APA (NASDAQ:APA), Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA) were the major gainers, while Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) declined more than 2% on reports that Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway isn’t considering a takeover despite increasing his stake to 50% in the oil major.  In other news, meme-related stocks including GameStop (NYSE:GME), Bed Bath&Beyond Inc (NASDAQ:BBBY), and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) were also under pressure, with the latter down more than 41% as the company’s new preferred share class begin trading.

795,ISU board OKs tuition increases and new budget,"The Indiana State University board of trustees on Friday approved a student tuition increase and a 2017-18 budget.

Tuition will increase 1.94 percent for 2017-18, or $85 per semester for a full-time, resident undergraduate student; that translates to $8,716 in tuition for the academic year, plus a $200 mandatory fee for the Student Recreation Center.
The goal of trustees ""was to make sure we were maintaining increases within the rate of inflation,"" said Diann McKee, senior vice president for finance.  Trustee Jeff Taylor, who chairs the trustees' finance committee, described the increase as ""modest and reasonable.""  It's estimated the tuition increase will generate an additional $2 million in revenue toward next year's budget.  In other action, trustees approved a $189.3 million balanced general fund budget for 2017-18, about a $3.5 million increase over 2016-17.  About $65.1 million is from the state operating appropriation, with $105 million from student tuition. Tuition now accounts for 55.7 percent of projected revenue for the budget, while state appropriations make up about 34.4 percent. Over the past decade, the university has become more dependent on tuition revenue and less on the state appropriation, McKee told trustees during a finance committee meeting.  ""It is critical"" that the university continue to meet enrollment targets and grow student numbers, she said. The university is keeping tuition increases minimal so it remains affordable, but ""unless you have enrollment growth, there isn't going to be a lot of growth in tuition, and we've become very dependent on it.""  Meanwhile, the trend of declining state operating appropriations continues, with a $774,754 reduction for next year because of performance-based funding metrics. A net decrease in state appropriations of $355,000 occurs over the 2017-2019 biennium.  The 2017-18 operating budget includes a projected 1.25 percent increased pool for salary adjustments, with criteria to be determined once fall enrollment is known.  The budget includes a 1.25 percent increase in student wages; a 2 percent increase in student scholarships and a 6.3 percent increase for health insurance. The budget also includes a reserve of 3 percent of the prior year's budget, or $5.3 million.  The university made reallocations, or reductions, of more than $1 million to pay for increased compensation and other priorities. Much of the reductions came from vacant positions and salary/benefit savings.  The budget also includes an additional state appropriation of $2.3 million dedicated to student success initiatives.  In summary, McKee said, the budget ""maintains affordability for our students and we have a budgeted reserve to offset any contingencies that were not anticipated. We do have a small planned increase in compensation for faculty and staff and we are adding additional dollars for student scholarships. It does contain over $1 million of reallocations and reductions throughout our budget.""  President's departure  In other business, the board approved the position profile for national advertising and recruiting candidates for the next university president. The profile was developed by the Presidential Search Committee and incorporates feedback from a stakeholders' survey and campus-wide listening sessions.  Candidates are being encouraged to submit applications to the search firm assisting the university by August 30.  After nearly a decade leading Indiana State, Bradley announced on April 26 his plans to step down as the university's 11th president, effective January 2018.  Trustees also approved a ""post presidency letter of agreement"" with Bradley. After he steps down in January 2018, he will begin a one-year paid leave at 116 percent of his then current salary.  Upon completion of the paid leave, and for the next four years, he will remain an active faculty member and be compensated as outlined in his employment agreement, or at 77 percent of his base salary. ""We expect to be Terre Haute residents,"" Bradley said after the meeting.  During the four years, he will work half-time, with one-half the workload and responsibilities of a fully tenured professor.  Twenty percent of his time will be devoted to university development and advancement, and 80 percent of his time will be devoted to academic affairs. He will be given office space and a supply/expense budget of $25,000 per year.  ""I'm going to be doing whatever the provost and the president tell me to do,"" Bradley said. ""I expect there will be some instruction or interaction with students, and it's my expectation there will be some development work as well.""

805,Amy Winehouse's net worth at the time of her tragic death and who her estate went to,"Amy Winehouse amassed an incredible fortune from her impressive singing career before her untimely death aged 27 – and her parents inherited her estate after her passing

Amy Winehouse, one of the world's most popular and promising stars, tragically passed away 10 years ago today, on July 23.
The 27-year-old Rehab singer was found dead in her London home in 2011, and was later found to have passed away from accidental alcohol poisoning.  The singer had amassed an incredible fortune throughout her impressive career, with the Back to Black album becoming the UK's biggest-selling album of the 21st century, which was eventually surpassed by Adele's 21.  But Amy didn't leave a will and her after-tax assets went to her mum, Janis and her dad Mitch.  Since the time of her death the value of her estate is believed to have grown considerably from song royalties.  Amy Winehouse net worth  Probate records showed that Amy's estate was listed as worth £4,257,580 in total assets, according to Forbes.  But after taxes and other debts her net worth was brought down to £2,944,554. Because she had no will, her parents inherited her estate.  Her parents went on to set up the Amy Winehouse Foundation to prevent harm from drug misuse among young people.  Winehouse made the eye-watering amount of money through her impressive singing career.  In 2002 she signed a deal with a record label, and a year later she released her first album, Frank.  Amy's second album, Back to Black, became even more successful – but it marked the beginning of a very dark time.  The singer won several awards, but she also had to cancel her US tour and was admitted to rehab.  She spent the rest of her life in a constant battle with addiction, and went back into rehab several times.  In 2011 she was forced to cancel another tour – a few months before her untimely death.  At the same time she released her first album, she met the man she would one day call her husband.  Blake Fielder-Civil was married to Amy from 2007 to 2009, and now reportedly lives in an estate in Leeds.  Fielder-Civil didn't inherit any money after Amy's death, despite the fact they were married during her time in the spotlight.  It was unlikely Amy's parents would share her inheritance with him, in an interview with ABC News, Mitch said he blamed him for his daughter's drug addiction. Blake has previously admitted to introducing her to heroin.  After Amy's death, Blake went into a coma due to a drug overdose.  He survived, and a few years later Fox News reported that he tried to make a claim against Winehouse's estate.  This was eight years after her death, which occurred two years after their divorce.  Fielder-Civil, who received a £250,000 pay out at the time of the divorce, reportedly felt he was entitled to a further claim.",0,,,0.0,0
810,Treasury Official: 'Seriously Considering' Criticism Of Mortgage Rule,"WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The Obama administration is ""seriously considering"" criticism of a proposal by bank regulators that could cause mortgage rates to rise on all but the safest home loans, a Treasury Department official is set to say Friday.

The administration and regulators have been under fire in recent weeks from lawmakers and an alliance of housing industry lobbying groups and advocates for minorities and consumers. They argue that a proposal mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law to overhaul the market for mortgage-backed securities will restrict credit and undermine the already weak housing market. The Dodd-Frank law aims to spur sounder lending practices by requiring banks that package mortgages and other assets into securities to have more ""skin in the game."" They are to meet this requirement by holding 5% of the credit risk for those loans.
An uproar on Capitol Hill has grown in recent weeks over how regulators interpreted a portion of the law that allows certain loans to be exempt from the requirement. Lawmakers, industry officials and consumer groups argue that regulators have misinterpreted the law and drawn up too-stringent criteria for these gold-standard loans, which are likely to cost borrowers less.  Regulators have given the public until August 1--nearly two months longer than originally planned--to comment on the proposal. ""We are seriously considering feedback and are committed to getting this rule right, so that we can ensure securitization is a stable and reliable source of credit for consumers, businesses, and homeowners,"" said Jeffrey Goldstein, under-secretary for domestic finance at the Treasury Department, in remarks prepared for a speech at a housing conference on Friday.  Under the proposal, a ""qualified residential mortgage"" exemption would kick in when borrowers make down payments of at least 20% and meet certain debt-to-income thresholds. Those loans would be exempt from risk-retention.  But critics worry that the exemption requirements will create a de facto underwriting standard for home buyers, making it hard for many first-time buyers to buy a home without a 20% down payment.  Earlier this week, a bipartisan group of lawmakers decried the rule, with Sen. Johnny Isakson (R., Ga.), saying it would ""make recovery in the housing market almost impossible"" and Sen. Kay Hagan (D., N.C.) saying that "" strict, inflexible restrictions proposed by banking regulators could put home ownership out of reach for many creditworthy American families.""  Goldstein, however, said the regulators, by establishing so-called risk-retention rules, aim to solve ""one of the major problems we saw in the financial crisis--the lack of alignment of interests"" between investors in mortgage-backed securities and the companies that make loans and package them into investments. ""We are committed to implementing risk retention reforms in a thoughtful manner that ensures continued access to sustainable mortgage credit for low- and moderate-income borrowers and protects the health of the still-fragile housing market."" he said. Better lending practices, he said, ""make future housing crises less likely and less damaging.""  -By Alan Zibel; 202-862-9262; alan.zibel@dowjones.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  June 24, 2011 05:14 ET (09:14 GMT)",0,,,0.0,0
816,Desjardins chief defends ESG amid skepticism from big fund bosses,"Companies have been jumping on the environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) bandwagon for years, but it's not just a fad for Desjardins Group, it's the Lévis, Que.-based firm's modus operandi.

""For us, it's not just a trendy new concept,"" said Guy Cormier, chief executive of North America's largest financial services co-operative with $371 billion in total assets. ""We launched our first environmental mutual fund in 1990. So, it's been more than 30 years that we are involved in the fight against climate change and try to promote financial products where people can invest their money with an impact on the planet.""
It's a strategy that is catching on elsewhere, with ESG assets under management topping $3.2 trillion in 2020, a 48 per cent increase over a two-year period( https://www.riacanada.ca/research/2020-canadian-ri-trends-report/ ), according to Canada's Responsible Investment Association.  In response to increased demand from investor clients, in late May, Desjardins expanded its SocieTerra brand, a line of funds connected to low-carbon businesses, which now includes 10 new funds and one portfolio.  Guy Cormier, chief executive of Desjardins Group.  But skeptics abound. Hard-line fund managers are vocal( https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-30/dimensional-esg-chief-adds-to-criticism-of-investing-style ) about their disdain for responsible investing. James Whittington, head of responsible investment at Austin, Tex.-based Dimensional Fund Advisors LP, which has about $857 billion of assets under management, said( https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/dimensional-esg-chief-adds-to-criticism-of-investing-style-1.1772415 ) responsible investing is not a meaningful driver of change.  Even as more and more investors sign onto the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment( https://www.unpri.org/about-us/what-are-the-principles-for-responsible-investment ) (PRI), which offers ways for investors to implement ESG principles into their strategies, critics say little has come from their efforts.  ""What actually happens when investors with $100 trillion of assets commit to investing more responsibly? The answer is not much - at least so far,"" wrote( https://hbr.org/2021/03/an-esg-reckoning-is-coming ) the Harvard Business Review in 2021. ""When companies offer insincere commitments or overpromise transformation, they risk undermining the real work being done by others.""  Canadian investors also remain unconvinced of the merits of such funds. In 2021, nearly half( https://www.statista.com/statistics/1196826/mutual-fund-investors-with-responsible-investments-canada/ ) of mutual fund investors in Canada said they still did not have responsible investments in their portfolios.  Desjardins, though, is serious about its commitment to responsible investing.  ""At least we're doing something,"" Cormier said. ""We have to start somewhere, and if we wait (for the moment) that every individual, every company is 10/10, and everything is perfect, we won't fix the challenge that we have to fix on this planet.""  Desjardins regularly checks in with the businesses it invests in to ensure they're still committed to ESG principles. Those that change their minds lose Desjardins' backing, Cormier said.  ""We want to be with you as partners, as long as we feel that you integrate ESG criteria,"" he said. ""But if you no longer want to be involved or serious ... at one point, Desjardins will leave the table.""  Green funds don't always perform well. Any ""promise that you can outperform the market by your insight and evaluating ESG risks probably isn't going to stack up,"" according to Dimensional's Whittington.  When asked whether green funds have lower returns, Cormier said, ""It's a myth... We have more and more members and clients that are saying, 'Yes, we want returns, but with my money, I'm not just trying to have as much as I can with my returns; I want to have an impact on companies, on people.'""  Responsible investing funds provide returns that are equal or superior to carbon-heavy ones, Marie-Justine Labelle, head of responsible investment at Desjardins, said. The reason is not necessarily because of the emphasis on ESG, but because companies that prioritize sustainability tend to be better managed overall, she said.  ""Companies that have the foresight to identify emerging environmental and social mega-trends and are proactive in addressing them ... are being better managed, more resilient, and better at adapting to these trends,"" she said. ""So, it may be something to do with better overall corporate management.""  Cormier said that while the E in ESG is important, people often forget about the S for social and G for governance.  ""The S in ESG is so important for us,"" he said.  Green still grey area for ESG investors despite mounting scrutiny by watchdogs in U.S. and Canada( https://financialpost.com/investing/green-still-grey-area-for-esg-investors-despite-mounting-scrutiny-by-watchdogs-in-u-s-and-canada )  Desjardins buys Canadian investment manager Hexavest, gaining $5 billion in assets( https://financialpost.com/investing/canadas-desjardins-buys-hexavest-adding-4-1-billion-in-assets )  Canadian climate activists ask bankers to close ESG debt loopholes( https://financialpost.com/investing/canadian-activists-ask-bankers-to-close-esg-debt-loopholes )  Green investing: The risk of a new misselling scandal( https://financialpost.com/investing/green-investing-the-risk-of-a-new-misselling-scandal )  To that end, Desjardins supports small business and financial literacy in schools. It also hires locally.  On the governance side of things, Desjardins tries to invest in companies where women make up at least 30 per cent of management or the board of directors. Cormier also listens to suggestions from the firm's youth advisory board he formed upon becoming president in 2016.  Despite a focus on ESG, Cormier said he also keeps a keen eye on rising interest rates and is concerned about a possible recession, though he's optimistic in light of rising wages and decreased unemployment.  ""I think that right now, there is a lot of noise in the system, regarding what is happening with the war in Ukraine and the oil price,"" he said.  Still, he doesn't think recession is a given. ""The next few months will be key to see where we are heading,"" he said.  .

821,"Wynn recognized for community service \; Sarah Wynn's Delicate Touch Salon has served the people of Wrens for more than 30 years at the same location, providing more than hair care for generations","On Thursday, Feb. 13, family and friends squeezed passed customers at Delicate Touch Salon to throw their arms around Sarah Louise Wynn and celebrate her service to the community and her retirement.

Wrens City Administrator Arty Thrift read a resolution recognizing Wynn's 38 years of service in cosmetology signed by Mayor Johnny Rabun.
Laughter rose above the buzz of clippers, the droning whoosh of the driers and the chatter of the more than 50 well-wishers who circulated through the shop on U.S. Highway One.  William and Sarah Wynn moved back to Wrens in the mid 1970s after her husband retired from the Marine Corps after suffering from a heart attack at Parris Island, SC.  ""I wanted to come back to Wrens because my family was here,"" Wynn said. ""It was a blessing I came back. There are some nice people in Wrens.""  She had been working at ThermoKing in Louisville for about three years when a second heart attack took her husband in 1977, leaving her alone with their 5-year-old daughter, Demetria.  Knowing she would now have to provide on her own for their family, Wynn decided she needed to quit work and go back to school. At first she thought about studying to be a nurse.  ""In nursing you have to go when they say go,"" she said.  Instead she chose cosmetology so she could be available for her daughter whenever she needed to be. She liked the idea of setting her own hours and being her own boss. When she started school, Wynn didn't know much of anything about cutting or styling anyone else's hair.  ""But anything I applied myself to I became good at,"" Wynn said.  She graduated the top of her class and went to work with Lucille Walker at the Beauty Box. A few months later Wynn noticed a little house for sale on U.S. Highway One, just a block and a half off Broad Street.  At that time there were not many black businesses downtown in Wrens, but she knew the area well and that there had once been many.  ""My daddy was raised up in this lot right over here and my great-grandmother had a restaurant over here,"" she said, pointing downtown. ""Right here on Short Street behind Peggy's, my grandparents and uncles had businesses. They owned a barbershop, a convenience store, a restaurant, and there was a funeral home back there too. All of that was black-owned (at one time).""  So Wynn hired a lawyer, got the money and bought the house. In 1984 she opened the salon she operates to this day.  It was a full-service salon offering hair analysis, relaxers, curls and cuts.  Demetria grew up at the base of a salon chair while her mother built a business.  ""It's something she loves doing,"" Demetria said. ""She has the passion for it and she's a real genuine people person. I think she's become so successful because no matter what, she came to the shop. She was sick sometimes but she came to the shop. She got up and served the people and it's still going.""  Demetria said she has ""beautiful memories"" of Delicate Touch and her mom's work.  Sometimes there were long days, Saturdays when the doors opened at 7 a.m. There was one Saturday before Easter when Delicate Touch had 33 children to treat and style in the single day.  ""Mama always helped people,"" Demetria said. ""If they didn't have a ride to come, she would make that happen. I think she's been so successful because she has a love for people and she really believed in serving her people.""  Wynn said that through the business she has been able to do more than serve the cosmetology needs of her clients, she has been able to serve other needs as well.  ""Really, God blessed me in this profession,"" Wynn said. ""He said come on Sara you need to be here. I paid for this shop in five years. And by having this business, if I heard about somebody that needed help, I helped them.""  In the late 1980s she helped raise money to bury a local man whose family did not have the money to cover those expenses. She has donated to multiple causes and provided jobs for teenagers and young adults who needed the opportunity.  Krystal Brown said she started cutting hair at Delicate Touch when she was in 10th grade and worked there on and off for around 15 years.  ""I have always worked high school kids,"" Wynn said. "" I gave them a job, but I always asked, are you in school. I always influenced them to stay in school. I told them school comes first. You got something to do, you go do it and then you can go back to work.""  After several years in business in Wrens Wynn partnered with her uncle Roy Boatwright and opened a second salon in Hephzibah. She ran both salons until she went to work as an examiner for the Georgia State Board of Cosmetology and Barbers and later trained students to become state board examiners.  Wynn slowed down and gave up most of her duties in the salon and at the state level three years ago when an injury made it hard to stand for long periods.  Today she still manages Delicate Touch, but barber Alton Crawford and stylists Evonne Brown and Alisha Hobbs see most of the customers there.  Crawford, who has had a barber chair in her salon for about 10 years, called Wynn a ""Godly woman.""  ""She'll do anything to try to help anybody,"" he said. ""She's a blessing to the community.""  Wynn herself said she was flattered by the attention she received last week. She says she owes her success to just being nice.  ""Some people come in and all they need is someone to talk to, someone to listen,"" she said. A friendly ear, it comes free with a wash and set.",0,,,0.0,0
825,"Not Just Renters: Mortgage Foreclosure Protections Expiring Too, Endangering 1.75 Million Homeowners","Foreclosure sign shown through a front gate of a foreclosed home in Oakland, California

The federal ban on evictions of renters wasn’t the only pandemic-related protection allowed to expire on July 31: a federal ban on foreclosures also ended, and while several ad hoc programs will mitigate the effect for a few months, nearly 2 million Americans remain behind on their house payments.
Just days after a global pandemic was declared in March 2020, the Trump administration began offering homeowners the option of forbearance on their federally-backed mortgage payments, allowing them to reduce or defer those payments without penalty as a way to weather the financial hardships created by covid-related shutdowns and job losses. The program affected homes with mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and state corporations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and at its height protected more than 11 million families.   However, the Biden administration said in June that its month-long refresh of the program would be its last, and as August begins, at least 1.75 million homeowners remain in forbearance, or 3.5% of all homes in the US, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) has created three new safeguards that will help mitigate or delay foreclosures for a time, but they are confined to borrowers who fell behind during the pandemic and ultimately won’t halt foreclosure altogether.  Those measures, which protect borrowers more than 120 days behind on their payments, include a loss mitigation program that can delay foreclosure; requiring loan servicers to verify that a property is considered abandoned under local and state laws before proceeding with a foreclosure; and requiring loan servicers to make a “reasonable” effort to contact borrowers and to wait 90 days after doing so before beginning the foreclosure process.However, those protections don’t go into effect until August 31, meaning some could still be kicked out of their homes in the month-long gap.  About 1.5 million of the 1.75 million in forbearance are at least 90 days behind - a number roughly equivalent to that reported in March 2021 - and at least 20% of them won’t be able to forestall foreclosure past September, according to the Washington Post.“This is just more of the K-shaped recovery,” Diane Thompson, senior adviser to acting CFPB director Dave Uejio, told the Post. “The ones who are left [in forbearance] are by and large people who aren’t paying, can’t pay and haven’t made payments for a very long time.”  The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) signed into law in April 2021 provided $10 billion in a Homeowners Assistance Fund to help homeowners pay off that debt, but “the program is moving so slowly that protections are expiring before states have figured out how to distribute the money,” the Post reported. According to the paper, by Saturday, the US Treasury hadn’t even opened its portal for states to submit their distribution plans, meaning they can only access some 10% of what’s been set aside.  Budding Movement Demands Return of Eviction Ban  A similar situation has plagued the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, created by the CARES Act in December 2020 to distribute $25 billion in bailouts to renters behind on their payments. Between the December allotment and a subsequent $21.5 billion created for state and local programs in early 2021, some $46 billion was set aside to save more than 15 million American renters from eviction.  However, as Sputnik has reported, the federal eviction moratorium mandated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was also allowed to expire at the end of July without being replaced by a more concrete action, such as a federal law or executive order, and just a tiny fraction of the aid money - $3 billion in federal funds and $1.5 billion in state and local funds - has actually been paid out to struggling renters.Unlike homeowners, renters never got an equivalent pause on their rent payments, which have piled up into substantial debts over the past 18 months.People camp out on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to highlight the upcoming expiration of the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions, in Washington, U.S., July 31, 2021.  The result is that millions of Americans behind on rent payments face the immediate or impending threat of being rendered homeless, as some state eviction bans are also set to expire in the coming weeks.  With House lawmakers beginning a seven-week summer recess on Friday without replacing the eviction ban and the Senate set to join them later this week, activists have rallied to the call by Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), a progressive freshman representative, to occupy the steps of the US Capitol building until a new protection is enacted.On Tuesday afternoon, the CDC suddenly reversed course and issued a new ""targeted"" moratorium lasting until October 3, noting the order is confined to target areas with significant community spread of COVID-19, which heightens the risks associated with eviction and homelessness.  Unemployment, Student Loan Help Ending  Other pandemic protections are also being allowed to sunset, as well. Many US states have already voluntarily ended their federal unemployment benefit programs even as millions remain without jobs and new unemployment applications are once again rising. The federal program created by the ARPA was given sufficient funding to operate until September 6, but more than half of state governments had already cut theirs by early July, driven by conservative beliefs that the payments have been keeping Americans from more adamantly seeking out employment.Student loan deferment, also introduced at the start of the pandemic by the US Department of Education, allowed millions of Americans to preserve their meager incomes during lockdown periods by putting off payment of loans used to pay for their college education. The program is set to expire on September 30, 2021, but Biden hasn’t yet spoken on the issue. Americans hold roughly $1.7 trillion student loan debt.  Several lawmakers have pushed the Biden administration to extend it until March 2022, and to forgive up to $50,000 per person in student loan debt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) appealed to Biden last week to make the move via executive action, urging that “failure to act would be unconscionable, would undermine our economic recovery.” ",1,,,0.0,0

838,Credit rating fix could hurt consumers   ,"Credit repair companies are taking advantage of a loophole in the calculation of credit scores, and fixing the problem will hurt consumers — particularly those just establishing credit.   

The practice, called ""piggybacking,"" has been used for years by consumers with good credit to help relatives or friends establish or improve their credit rating. Parents with good credit, for instance, can authorize a child to use their credit card and that act will boost the youngster's fledgling credit score.   
Credit repair agencies are paying consumers with high credit scores to authorize its poor-scoring clients to piggyback on the solid accounts. The clients pay $800 to $900 to boost their score, said Oklahoma City attorney Eric Johnson. The participants with good credit can earn several hundred dollars for each person they authorize on a credit card.     A recent Associated Press story related how a Florida real estate agent paid $1,800 to be added as an authorized user on several credit card accounts with pristine credit. Alipio Estruch's credit score jumped from a 550 to 715 in about a month, and he secured a 7.5 percent mortgage rate to buy a $449,000 home.     Johnson, of the Phillips McFall law firm, represents a local mortgage lender and an auto lender, each of which was misled by customers' inflated credit scores. The customers later defaulted on loans granted because the credit scores were hiked through the piggybacking loophole, Johnson said.     ""I see it as mortgage fraud or outright fraud,"" Johnson said.     Scores of credit enhancement Web sites offer the service for a fee, Johnson said. Federal regulators could enforce existing laws to prevent the practice, Johnson said, but appear unwilling to try.     ""The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) looked at this and said 'We can't say this is illegal or is legal,'"" Johnson said. ""There are your tax dollars at work.""     The impact of the relatively new procedure likely will spread to insurance companies, which use credit scores to set rates, and businesses, which often purchase credit scores of potential employees during the hiring process, Johnson said.     Fair Isaac, the company that created the proprietary formula that determines credit scores, will close the loophole later this year in its calculation of FICO scores for at least one of the three credit reporting agencies. The other two credit reporting agencies should adopt the new scoring within a year, Fair Isaac said.     ""We will continue working with lenders, regulators and others in the credit reporting industry to end deceptive practices that fraudulently misrepresent consumer credit histories for profit,"" said Mark Greene, chief executive officer of Fair Isaac.     The adjustment removes authorized user accounts from consideration by the scoring model in FICO 08, the newest version of the credit score that Fair Isaac expects to become available to lenders starting in September.     Meanwhile, lenders will have to spend more time, effort and money to evaluate potential customers, Johnson said.     ""The whole credit industry now revolves around ability to take a look at that FICO score and make a decision on an interest rate or monthly payments based on that one score,"" Johnson said. ""If you can't rely on the FICO score, then you must go back to a manual scoring system.""     ""It's really bad stuff,"" Johnson said. ""Hopefully, we'll see it corrected and turned around, but it's not taking place quickly enough.""     Unfortunately, Fair Issac's new policy will shut down a method of building a credit history and score that has been used by consumers for years. And there are a lot more children, spouses or friends who will be affected than there are people who are manipulating the system, Fair Isaac said.

840,What now for the TSX?; Slow climb may give investors déjà vu,"Investors who put up with lacklustre Canadian stock returns in recent years were finally paid off this week for keeping the faith.

The S&P/TSX Composite index pushed to record new highs this week, topping out at 15,112 on Thursday, above its previous record high of 15,073, set in June 2008. While the index pulled back slightly by Friday to 15,109, the level nevertheless leaves the TSX among the best-performing major stock markets around the world, with an 11% yearto-date gain, behind only the 18.6% gain of India's S&P BSE Sensex.
Technical analysts will tell you the TSX tends to be the last major market to top out in an economic growth cycle, as was the case last time. The S&P 500 reached a record high in 2007, a full year before the TSX. Canadian stock investors had little time to celebrate the TSX's high-water mark in 2008, as financial markets started crashing just a few months later.  If investors are feeling a sense of déjà vu, it is because, once again, the TSX returns to its highs a full year behind its American counterparts.  But analysts say the Canadian stock market may not be doomed to repeat history as there are a lot of differences this time around.  ""We're a long way from what happened in 2008,"" said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""Right now, we're in a [monetary] easing cycle, and back then we were in a tightening cycle. Sure, stocks are expensive, but I don't think it's a fair comparison.""  Canadian stock valuations are now at a three-year high, which will certainly make some investors anxious. But, at the same time, the TSX has spent the past three years lagging its global peers, including American, Japanese and European stocks. For example, the S&P 500 churned out a blockbuster return of nearly 30% last year, while Canadian stock investors were left with a much less impressive 9.6% return.  Analysts have expected the TSX to catch up for some time. The resource-heavy index tends to peak late in the economic cycle, because that's when energy and industrial stocks generally take the baton from the types of companies that excel earlier in the economic cycle, such as consumer and financial stocks.  True to forecasts, the past couple of weeks have been a boon for energy stocks, which comprise roughly one-third of the Canadian stock market. The sector was up 5% in the past two weeks alone and is up 23.7% in 2014.  Unrest in Iraq, spurred by the capture of key towns by Al-Qaeda offshoot The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), drove oil prices to one-year highs this month. Iraq is considered one of the world's most important markets for future oil supply growth and having an extremist militant group threaten the country's capital has spooked traders.  The heightened geopolitical risk has helped the TSX, but analysts are quick to point out that it can be risky for investors to be too bullish on Canadian stocks when they trade at record levels.  ""You have to be careful, because when you've been at these levels before, it's not been pretty and major selloffs have come quickly,"" said Bill Strazzullo, partner and chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. ""The 14,000 to 15,000 range, as 2008 and 2011 showed us, has been a perilous place to have exposure to the TSX.""  Trading at highs has always been a risky proposition for Canadian stocks, since their peaks often come late in the economic cycle, but market watchers note there is still a lot of potential. Multiple expansion, which has helped drive gains south of the border, has yet to bloom here, and earnings are expected to continue improving as Canadian companies benefit from a weak loonie that is trading at roughly a 10% discount to the U.S. dollar.  ""Canadian stocks are not cheap, but they are not expensive from a historical context,"" said Greg Taylor, vice-president and portfolio manager at Aurion Capital Management Inc. ""What we need to see the market go higher is expansion. What makes this year different than other years is we finally have commodity prices kicking in; we've seen that with oil, and we now need to see earnings expansion.""  But with Canadian stocks finally outperforming their U.S. counterparts after three years of disappointing returns, the question is whether that outperformance can continue.  Mr. Kavcic at BMO Capital Markets said many economists are forecasting the U.S. economy to outpace the Canadian economy in the coming years, so the TSX might not get to enjoy its current outsized gains for very long.  ""I would probably lean toward both markets returning to lockstep returns in the coming years,"" he said. ""The TSX has made up quite a bit of ground in the past couple of months, and unless you get oil prices to continue to run up the way they have, I don't see Canada continuing to outperform.""  Mr. Taylor disagrees, predicting that if the market cycle is in fact currently in the middle phase and commodity prices continue to climb, the TSX should post better returns than its U.S. counterparts over the next 12 to 18 months. He does, however, identify one risk that could prevent that from happening: the U.S. Federal Reserve. ""The biggest risk is if Fed comes out and says they're behind the curve and start tightening sooner than expected,"" he said. ""That could throw off the market and halt the current rally.""  It's also worth noting that the TSX hasn't been above 15,000 for very long so the rally hasn't been stress tested. Mr. Strazzullo said he would wait until the TSX could stay above that level for more than a week before he became more bullish on the index.  ""I would feel a little better about it if we can hold another week here, hold at 15,000, because that would make me think the path of least resistance is higher,"" he said. ""If we can do that, then I would start talking about potential upside of 16,500. Not necessarily that it will reach that level, but we can start to see that kind of room on the upside.""  jshmuel@nationalpost.com  15,073.13 Previous TSX record close on June 18, 2008  15,109.25 New TSX record close on June 18, 2014 (A new record close was set June 19)",0,,,0.0,0

849,'Tension' as pension cuts divide the generations: Fears Osborne's reshaping of tax benefits could lead to strain between workers and those who are retired,"* Workers realise they are losing out to retired people, financial experts warn

* George Osborne considering radical changes to tax benefits on pensions
* Workers will ‘lose out’ under plans to cut amount of tax relief on pensions  Changes to pensions risk ‘inflaming inter-generation tensions’ as workers realise they are losing out to retired people, financial experts have warned.  The Chancellor George Osborne is considering radical changes to tax benefits on pensions which are expected to hit middle-class savers hardest.  But workers in their 40s or younger will also ‘lose out’ if he goes ahead with plans to cut the amount of tax relief the government gives on pension savings, financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown said.  It warned that today’s workers are already set to receive around a third less in retirement than current pensioners and any changes would worsen the generational wealth divide.  The average private pension wealth held by those aged around 60 is about £149,300, but those now in their 40s will only have around £112,000 when they reach the same age, it said.  Tom McPhail, head of Retirement Policy, said government financial support for retirement needed to remain equal for all generations or it would risk ‘exacerbating the inequalities which already exist’ between old and young.  He added: ‘Today’s pensioners have worked hard and are now enjoying the fruits of their labours; no one would seek to deny them that.  ‘However we are deeply concerned that the younger workers of today face an uphill battle to achieve the same levels of retirement prosperity.  ‘Younger workers look with understandable envy at the generous guaranteed pensions enjoyed by many of today’s retirees.  ‘By contrast, workers in their 20s, 30s and 40s today can look forward to later retirement, lower contributions and fewer guarantees.  ‘Any reduction to the support given by the government to pension savers risks inflaming intergeneration tension.’  Currently, basic rate taxpayers receive a £2 top-up of tax relief from the Government for every £8 they save into a pension, while higher rate taxpayers – those earning more than £42,385 - receive £4 for every £6 saved.  The Government is considering plans to replace this system with one where all savers receive the same top-up – possibly around £2.50 for every £7.50 saved – regardless of how much they earn. It may also scrap the system all together and allow pensions to be drawn tax-free in retirement instead, like an ISA.  Research carried out for the Mail by pensions provider Fidelity found a middle class worker now in their 40s stands to lose between £44,000 and £110,000 by the age of 65 if Mr Osborne limits the tax relief paid on pensions.  The same worker would miss out on as much as £175,000 from their total pot if he scraps it altogether and treats pensions like ISAs instead.  Research by Royal London, a pensions provider, published today revealed a flat rate of tax relief at 25 per cent would be worth just £2 per week extra to basic rate taxpayers but could deter middle income workers from saving altogether.  Former Pensions Minister Steve Webb, who now works for the firm, said tinkering with pension tax relief amounted to ‘daylight robbery’.  He added: ‘A pension ISA steals billions of pounds in tax revenues from the next generation who will need the money to fund the public services of an ageing society.  ‘And if the Chancellor opts for a low flat-rate of tax relief, he will be stealing billions of pounds today from the support we give to hard-pressed savers.’  He warned last week that the Chancellor was also considering scrapping the tax free lump sum, in a move which would raise £4billion for the Treasury but affect millions of savers.",1,,,1.0,1
861,Summer reading gets a musical boost,"Several community libraries in the mid-Willamette Valley will get musical boost to their respective Summer Reading programs next month.

Children's musician Rich Glauber has July gigs scheduled in Mt. Angel, Lyons and Jefferson, a feature provided through the Oregon College Savings Plan (OCSP). The shows, dubbed ""Music in Action!,"" are described as high-energy, interactive mixes of songs, movement and comedy for all ages, using guitar, accordion, percussion and voice, along with a variety of props.
Organizers said Glauber's performance focuses on building community spirit and fun through music.  ""My shows are mostly about fun, about finding the joy of moving to music, singing out, playing instruments and celebrating life,"" Glauber said. ""Kids don't get enough of that these days, and I like to give them the opportunity when I come to town.""  OCSP facilitated the incorporation of this element into the prolific Summer Reading Programs, which are implemented at numerous community libraries around the region. Program officials specified that the performance is part of this year's annual Summer Reading program's ""On Your Mark, Get Set, Save!,"" a statewide campaign that encourages kids and teens to participate in summer reading at their local library.  ""Summer reading allows kids to pursue their individual interests while maintaining and strengthening reading skills like comprehension and vocabulary,"" said Michael Parker, executive director of the Oregon 529 Savings Network. ""Those are skills that can prevent a child from struggling academically during the school year, and help better prepare them for higher education in the future.""  The summer reading campaign runs from May 1 through Aug. 26. Oregon State Library counts 206,425 youth, ranging from infancy through age 18, who signed up the program last year at public libraries throughout Oregon. Collectively, registrants read 144,643 books, while least 68,735 achieved their reading goal and completed the 2015 summer reading program.  OCSP officials encourage parents to pick up an entry form at the library for a chance to win a $529 Oregon College Savings Plan account, plus $500 for the winner's library. Up to 15 winners — three from each Oregon congressional district — will be selected in a random drawing at the conclusion of the program.

868,Student loan situation offers quandary,"It was a kind of mania. People got in too deep, way overleveraged. Why? The cost of being in the game kept going up - but so, it seemed, did the return on investment. You just had to get in, get out and find a nice landing spot, before the music stopped.

Yes, that description fits the financial crisis that sparked the Great Recession. But it also describes student loans, which at a total of $1.75 trillion surpass Americans' aggregate credit-card debt and have some politicians talking about broad forgiveness. Both cases highlight a special brand of moral hazard - the kind our government creates when it helps fuel a problem, and then proposes a solution that allows others to escape the consequences of their actions.
Moral hazard is often invoked to describe the effects of a given action. For example: ""If we give amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people will immigrate here illegally."" That kind of moral hazard is worth heeding.  But another aspect is likely at play with student loans: Even talking about an action will prompt some people to behave as it will happen eventually. Returning to the immigration example: ""Because highranking politicians say they want to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people already have immigrated here illegally.""  The mere possibility of being let offthe hook is enough for some desperate or just imprudent people to get themselves hooked in the first place - risking death or financial ruin.  Some actors in the financial crisis were probably (ahem) banking on a bailout if they got into trouble. There were plenty of examples within the memory of longtime executives: Penn Central Railroad, Lockheed, Franklin National Bank, Chrysler, Continental Illinois, various savings and loan institutions, even New York City - all between 1970 and 1990.  ""Too big to fail"" was almost 25 years old when it again became a common phrase in 2008. Too many lenders and investors had been spared the consequences of backing overly aggressive banks in the past.Were those banks indeed ""too big to fail""? Maybe. More to the point, the notion they might ever be allowed to fail came too late to prevent their bad behavior.  Back to student loans. No one believes for one second that a blanket forgiveness of student loans by the federal government - the lender in the vast majority of student loans - would be a one-time thing, any more than bank bailouts have been. If it is done once, it will become a permanent expectation.  But is it an expectation already?  Student debt certainly has increased in recent decades, by any measure. But short of thousands of borrowers admitting they took on debt thinking they'd get a bailout one day, it's hard to prove they acted on the expectation of loan forgiveness.  That said, the numbers tilt in that direction. The average cost for tuition and fees at a public university was about 5.1 times higher in 2020 than four decades earlier; for private universities, it was about 3.3 times higher.  The amount of debt per student was about 7.7 times higher. What's more, the share of enrolled students who took out loans also rose substantially.  Students' willingness to take on debt is growing out of proportion, even to the soaring cost of higher education. This, despite the increasing clarity that salaries for college graduates aren't keeping up with debt loads. (The debt-toincome ratio for college grads tripled between 1980 and 2020.)  Did politicians' promises to wipe out student debt spur these trends? We can't say for sure. But in a country divided 50-50 politically, with only two major parties, the eventual likelihood of leaders who favor loan forgiveness coming to power and finding a way to enact that policy surely is high enough for some people to believe their debts would be erased.  We're now navigating the hazards of that kind of thinking. The best way to reduce student borrowing may be to stop telling students they won't have to pay back their loans.

882,Ten Developments in the Retirement Plan Industry,"Executives from MassMutual and Voya Financial discussed trends driving the retirement plan industry.

Executives from Voya Financial and MassMutual discussed 10 developments in the retirement plan industry at the 2016 PLANADVISER National Conference’s panel, “Top Trends.”
First and foremost are new regulations and policies, led by the new fiduciary rule, said Charles Nelson, chief executive officer of retirement at Voya Financial. “Each company will approach it differently,” he said. “Some may utilize the best interest contract (BIC) exemption or retreat from offering certain services. At Voya, we will utilize the BIC where it is most appropriate.”  Another regulatory development is open multiple employer plans (MEPs), which have a chance of being “approved in Washington, and that could help us grow our industry,” Nelson said.  Second, is the growing recognition of the cost of employees not being retirement ready. “Many years ago, companies sought to limit their liabilities by freeing their defined benefit plans,” said Tina Wilson, senior vice president, head of retirement solutions innovation at MassMutual. “But that liability still exists if employees don’t have sufficient funds to retire and are financially trapped.”  Sponsors and their advisers need to ensure that participants are “funding their plan adequately,” Wilson said. “Typically, the CFO is not engaged in the plan. We looked at plans with 1,000 employees and found that, on average, it is costing them $2.7 million to $3 million a year in the liability of employees unable to retire. We must measure this cost” and call sponsors’ attention to it.  Third is the need to engineer a retirement plan for success. “401(k) plans were designed to be supplemental,” said Nelson, who then pointed to six ways advisers can help “DB-itize” defined contribution plans. Use automatic enrollment, he said, paired with qualified default investment alternatives (QDIAs) that place participants’ funds into appropriately diversified portfolios. “Optimize the match to ensure people are saving at the right levels. Use escalation, reenrollment and embrace income” options, he said.  NEXT: Outcomes  Fourth is the value of investments in driving outcomes. MassMutual has studied outcomes in detail and has learned for “savers early on, investments are irrelevant,” Wilson said. “Instead, it’s about how much you save. But at age 40, 45, investments become critical.” That’s why people at this age and older need to be invested in “target-date funds, managed accounts or custom portfolios that are a diversified default,” she said.  Fifth, it is important to apply behavioral science to retirement innovation. “Innovation is critical and we haven’t been that innovative with enrollment,” Nelson said. “We don’t think everything should be digital. Choose different platforms” for different touch points, he said.  Sixth, are data-driven asset allocation solutions. By this, Wilson said, the industry needs to embrace smart data platforms where demographics are tailored to “individualized circumstances to select [a certain] glidepath or custom allocation. It’s much more proscriptive on am individualized level.”  Seventh is weighing income replacement versus account balances. “Income is the new outcome,” Nelson said. “Plan sponsors are becoming increasingly focused on income, and that is how you are going to be measured going forward. But include all sources, including IRAs and Social Security.”  Eighth is finding solutions for income. “Income is also very personal,” Wilson said. “Solutions need to work for each individual. No one size fits all. It must be a set of solutions that are worked through an adviser, not a tool.”  Ninth is financial wellness that extends beyond the defined contribution plan. This means “holistic solutions to solve income stream needs. Income needs fluctuate in retirement, so solutions should be designed accordingly,” Nelson said.  Finally, participants need help navigating healthcare costs and building true financial wellness. “Because participants say healthcare costs prevent them from saving more for retirement, we need to talk about a benefits budget to optimize their spending and help them make better financial decisions,” Wilson said.",1,,,0.0,0
884,BPI Refutes Key Misconceptions in Response to CFPB Review of Bank Fees,"Washington, March 31 -- Bank Policy Institute issued the following news release:

The Bank Policy Institute responded today to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s review of fees charged by financial institutions. The Bureau is seeking information on fees related to deposit accounts, credit cards, remittances and payments, prepaid accounts, mortgages and other loans, but relies on four critical misconceptions as the basis for its review. BPI refutes these misconceptions in its response and highlights the many laws and regulations already in place to protect and inform consumers and foster competition.
What is BPI Saying: Greg Baer, BPI President and CEO, issued the following statement:  Banks compete aggressively for consumers’ business, and any fees they charge are disclosed consistent with a regime mandated by Congress and administered by the CFPB. The Bureau’s RFI cites no data and provides no empirical analysis to support its overwrought assertions about “junk” or “surprise” bank fees, and remarkably fails to acknowledge that those fees are fully disclosed under a regime that the Bureau administers. Nor does the RFI seek meaningful input from commenters or suggestions on how to improve its regulations, preferring instead simply to solicit complaints.  What the CFPB Got Wrong:  The Request for Information issued by the Bureau:  1. Assumes fees are not transparently disclosed to consumers in advance. Banks are broadly required by various congressional mandates and agency regulations, many of which are directly administered by the CFPB, to provide customers with detailed disclosures for virtually all consumer financial products and services, up-front, including about fees charged.  2. Charges that the financial services industry is non-competitive. The already competitive banking industry has seen a significant increase in competition from online banks, FinTechs and other consumer financial product and service providers. Recent research demonstrates that the U.S. banking industry is much less concentrated than other industries that serve U.S. households.  Further, the vast framework requiring disclosure of virtually all fees further promotes competition for banking products and services.  3. Fails to acknowledge the benefits of financial products and services for consumers. Consumers enjoy 24-hour-a-day access to payment services and FDIC insurance of up to $250,000 on checking and savings accounts. They also benefit from protection against fraudulent charges, assistance with merchant disputes, access to reward programs, and interest-free loans on credit card products when balances are fully repaid every month. Many of these products come with features such as branch access, online banking capabilities and other innovations with an underlying cost to banks that consumers are generally provided without a fee.  4. Inaccurately asserts that most revenue earned by banks is from fees. Banks generate most earnings from net interest income — earnings obtained from the fundamental banking function of funding loans through deposits.  Additional Background:  The Bureau issued its Request for Information in January 2022. In the Request, the Bureau sought to outline several broad examples of what it incorrectly characterizes as “junk fees” while also likening these fees to those found outside of the banking industry, such as resort fees and concert ticket fees. BPI issued a public statement in collaboration with a broad coalition of trade associations representing both banks and credit unions following the initial announcement.  Comments were originally due on March 31; however, the Bureau announced an extension until April 11, 2022.  About Bank Policy Institute.  The Bank Policy Institute (BPI) is a nonpartisan public policy, research and advocacy group, representing the nation’s leading banks and their customers.

A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to exempt property from the decedent's estate. On and after January 1, 2012, the dollar limit for exempt property to which a surviving spouse is entitled is increased from $26,000 to $78,000. On and after January 1, 2012, the dollar limit for the family allowance taken out of the estate for the maintenance of the family during the administration of the estate is increased from $24,000 to $72,000.

The bill suspends those cost of living adjustments for one year when the increase in the dollar amounts due to this bill takes effect.  Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:  SECTION 1. 15-11-403, Colorado Revised Statutes, is amended to read:  15-11-403. Exempt property.

If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent's dependent children are entitled jointly to the same exempt property. Rights to exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, except claims for the costs and expenses of administration, and reasonable funeral and burial, interment, or cremation expenses, which shall be paid in the priority and manner set forth in section 15-12-805. The right to exempt property shall abate as necessary to permit payment of the family allowance.

THE RIGHT TO EXEMPT PROPERTY SHALL ABATE AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PAYMENT OF THE FAMILY ALLOWANCE. THESE RIGHTS ARE IN ADDITION TO ANY BENEFIT OR SHARE PASSING TO THE SURVIVING SPOUSE OR DEPENDENT CHILDREN BY THE DECEDENT'S WILL, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED, BY INTESTATE SUCCESSION, OR BY WAY OF ELECTIVE-SHARE.  (2) The dollar amount stated in PARAGRAPH (a) OR (b) OF subsection (1) of this section shall be increased or decreased based on the cost of living adjustment as calculated and specified in section 15-10-112; EXCEPT THAT, WHEN THE INCREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNT STATED IN PARAGRAPH (b) OF SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION, AS ENACTED IN SENATE BILL 11-________, ENACTED IN 2011, TAKES EFFECT, THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR ONE YEAR.  SECTION 2. 15-11-405 (1), Colorado Revised Statutes, is amended to read:  15-11-405. Source, determination, and documentation. (1) (a) (I) If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised or disposed of by memorandum under section 15-11-513 to any person other than a person entitled to exempt property may not be used to satisfy rights to exempt property. Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, the guardians of minor children, or dependent children who are adults may select property of the estate as their exempt property. The personal representative may make these selections if the surviving spouse, the dependent children, or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time or there is no guardian of a minor child. The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as exempt property allowance. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2012, the personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum not exceeding twenty-four thousand dollars or periodic installments not exceeding two thousand dollars per month for one year and may disburse funds of the estate in payment of the family allowance. The personal representative or an interested person aggrieved by any selection, determination, payment, proposed payment, or failure to act under this section may petition the court for appropriate relief, which may provide a family allowance other than that which the personal representative determined or could have determined.  (II) IF THE ESTATE IS OTHERWISE SUFFICIENT, PROPERTY SPECIFICALLY DEVISED OR DISPOSED OF BY MEMORANDUM UNDER SECTION 15-11-513 TO ANY PERSON OTHER THAN A PERSON ENTITLED TO EXEMPT PROPERTY MAY NOT BE USED TO SATISFY RIGHTS TO EXEMPT PROPERTY.

(b) The dollar amount stated in SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OR (II) OF paragraph (a) of this subsection (1) shall be increased or decreased based on the cost of living adjustment as calculated and specified in section 15-10-112; EXCEPT THAT, WHEN THE INCREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNT STATED IN SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF PARAGRAPH (a) OF THIS SUBSECTION (1), AS ENACTED IN SENATE BILL 11-________, ENACTED IN 2011, TAKES EFFECT, THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR ONE YEAR.  SECTION 3. Act subject to petition - effective date - applicability.

901,"Fund supermarkets can turn into a harvest festival Why not shop for investments under one roof, asks Nina Montagu-Smith  ","YOU can save time and money by choosing the investment funds for your individual savings account (Isa) from a fund supermarket.  

Just like normal supermarkets, which stock products from many different brands, it is possible to buy funds from different providers at a fund supermarket and hold them in the same Isa.  
You can also re-register all your existing personal equity plan (Pep) and Isa holdings with the fund supermarket to keep them under one roof, without changing providers. This will mean you receive just one statement for your whole portfolio.    You can also switch funds more easily, much more cheaply and access online information about funds and sectors to help you make your choice.    It is also possible to buy funds without using an Isa tax wrapper and some supermarkets are starting to roll out other products, such as sharedealing, investment bonds and self-invested personal pensions (Sipps).    There are around eight fund supermarkets operating in the UK. The most popular are CoFunds, which is online and only accepts business through financial advisers, and Fidelity Funds Network ( www.fundsnetwork.co.uk ), both of which have in excess of pounds 7bn under management.    Hargreaves Lansdown, the independent financial adviser (IFA), operates its own supermarket called Vantage ( www.hargreaveslansdown . co.uk), which has pounds 5bn under management. Others include Skandia, Celestia, Transact, Seven, and Abbey Lifetime.    The concept has become so popular that IFAs say they now do most of their business via fund supermarkets.    Philippa Gee of IFA Torquil Clark said her firm does 90pc of its investment fund business on behalf of clients this way. Torquil Clark uses Fidelity Funds Network, which operates online and which investors can access directly.    The main benefit is reduced costs. Investors can get big discounts on initial charges of funds. If they want to switch, the cost of doing so is also greatly reduced.    Doug Naismith, managing director of European personal investment at Fidelity, said: ""We are dealing at 1.25pc to 1.5pc instead of the usual initial charge of around 5pc on most funds. We charge just 0.25pc for a switch and there are no exit charges. We offer nearly 1,000 funds from over 50 fund managers and all the household names are there.''    Ms Gee said: ""It typically costs 0.25pc to carry out a switch, which is much cheaper than the 5pc-plus you might otherwise have had to pay.''    Mr Naismith said Fidelity Funds Network offers an online questionnaire to help investors choose their funds. It assesses their level of risk before making suggestions and provides an electronic ""assistant''. Around three-quarters of investors come via IFAs, however, so have already received advice.    Mr Naismith said: ""This is a really flexible system. You get a consolidated statement and you can deal at midnight if you want to.''    Mark Jones, marketing and product development director at CoFunds, said the supermarket offers nearly 900 funds from 53 fund managers. He said: ""In the old days you would have to ring around all your providers for a valuation and that could take days. Now you can get an instant valuation at the press of one button.''    Ms Gee added: ""You can also make the investment online so that you do not have to rely on postal applications. This is particularly useful when your time is limited or the end of the tax year is approaching.''    Vantage offers access to more than 700 funds with no initial charge and around 100 more at about 0.5pc initial charge. Vantage also offers discounts on annual management charges plus no charge for switching funds.    Mark Dampier, from Hargreaves Lansdown, which operates Vantage, said: ""If you have done Peps and Isas every year since they were introduced, you would now have about 20 pieces of paper coming through the door every six months to update you on their progress. You won't move your funds when you probably should because it is too much trouble.    ""If you had got in early to Invesco Perpetual European, for example, and invested pounds 6,000, you would have seen it rise to about pounds 35,000 in four years. That's great, but you are now overweight in Europe. In a supermarket, you can take pounds 20,000 of that and invest it in the Far East with any fund manager you like. If you just have an Invesco Perpetual Isa, however, you could only switch to another Invesco Perpetual fund.''    Before you choose your supermarket, check the charges on offer, and check that you will have access to the investment choices you need. If you have to use more than one supermarket, that will defeat the purpose.    Ms Gee said: ""It is far better to stick with one super-market, as the whole concept is based on accessing your assets in one place only, rather than different sources.''

905,Hungary - Life Insurance - Competitive Landscape,"The life insurance market will be analyzed taking insurance companies as players. The key buyers will be taken as consumers (both individual as well as corporate), and ICT manufacturers, software houses and reinsurance companies as the key suppliers.

The Hungarian life insurance market recovered this year from a recent contraction in value; however, despite the increase in growth the degree of rivalry is measured as strong.
Buyer power is moderate overall as is the ability of new players in entering the market place with supplier power remaining strong. Despite savings and investments being among the alternative methods of insuring one’s self, substitutes possess a weak force in the market, due to the expertise and capital required for investment.  The demand for life insurance is determined by various factors: i.e. gross domestic product, average length of life expectancy, inflation and interest rates. Additionally, in developing countries, factors such as market structure, the presence of foreign investors and financial development of economies should be taken into consideration. There are also various reasons for getting a life insurance policy. Such a policy guarantees a replacement income for one’s dependents in case of death or major illness. Some types of life insurance create a cash value that, if not paid out as a death benefit, can be borrowed or withdrawn on the owner’s request, which makes it an important element of sound financial planning and investment.  Since most people consider paying their life insurance policy premiums a high priority, buying a cash-value type policy can create a kind of “forced” savings plan. Various companies can also use group life insurance to cover their employees or corporate-owned life insurance (COLI). COLI was originally purchased by companies to hedge against the financial cost of losing key employees to unexpected death, the risk of recruiting and training replacements of necessary or highly-trained personnel, or to fund corporate obligations to redeem stock upon the death of an owner.  A point to consider in the current economic climate is the drop in real income during 2009. Followed by slow growth in 2010 this may limit the demand for insurance products, which are unlikely to be considered a priority by households at present.  Due to the nature of the market and importance of the product offered, there are many individual consumers, diminishing buyer power, as the impact of losing an individual customer is rather marginal. Large corporate clients have a lot more bargaining power with insurance companies as they usually pay millions of dollars a year in premiums and losing such high-margin corporate clients can negatively affect a player's revenues. This increases buyer power to some extent. Customers in this market are not particularly loyal to one specific company and are willing to shop round for the best deal. Online comparison sites allow customers to choose policies that meet their individual insurance needs, further boosting buyer power.  However buyer power is weakened by the existence of switching costs, as for individuals, switching from one player to another will often involve surrendering a policy early (an exception is where a term policy reaches its end and the buyer chooses a different company for their next policy). The payout on a surrendered policy may be taxable, whereas the payout on the death of the insured person is tax-free; also early surrender of an index-linked plan may mean that the policyholder misses out on some interest payments. Buyer power is assessed as moderate overall.  Suppliers in the life insurance market include ICT manufacturers and software houses. Certain insurance companies require specialized computer systems, tailored towards their unique range of products or services. Underwriters, for instance, use computer applications known as ""smart systems"" to manage risks. These types of systems are complex and are often linked up to an internet databases. A secure and reliable ICT infrastructure is essential and companies are often reliant on one supplier. This is normally a large and reputable company, such as IBM. Such suppliers may have their own unique and patented systems. This creates a disincentive for insurance companies to switch suppliers as many employers are reluctant to spend the money training staff on new systems, which increases supplier power. Despite many insurance companies maintaining their own IT departments, there is little likelihood of significant backward integration, which further strengthens suppliers (although it is equally unlikely that suppliers would attempt to integrate forwards into insurance services). Life insurers also require the services of reinsurance companies, in order to reduce their own exposure to insured risks. Overall supplier power is strong in the life insurance market.  During much of Communist era, the only insurer operating in Hungary was Állami Biztosító Rt (ÁB Rt), (State Insurance Company). In 1986, as the government began the initial move toward full economic transition, ÁB Rt was split into two, to encourage competition, and following the change of political system both were officially registered in 1990 as the public companies ÁB Rt and Hungária Biztosító Rt. In 1992, the transition to a privately-owned insurance system was completed with the sale of ÁB to Dutch giant Aegon and Hungária to German insurer Allianz, opening the market for foreign competition.  Barriers to entry into life insurance market are often described as low; however new players entering the market must decide whether to initially enter on a large or small scale, with each holding varying benefits and risks. The opportunity to enter the market on a small scale boosts the threat of new entrants. Entry into the market for well developed insurance companies is capital intensive and players need to ensure some level of integration if market entry is to be a success. Leading incumbents have strong reputations and consumer recognition and they usually offer a vast range of services with which new entrants must compete. Most of the threat from new entrants lies within the insurance industry itself. Repeat business is difficult to attain in this market, since consumers will typically replace their life insurance policies at infrequent intervals only. This means that finding new custom is vital, and access to distribution networks is a key criterion for successful market entry. Some companies have carved out niche areas in which they underwrite insurance. These insurance companies are fearful of being squeezed out by the bigger players. Another threat for many insurance companies is other financial services companies entering the market. Indeed some banks and investment banks have started to offer insurance products, while certain financial commitments, such as mortgages, have life policies attached to them. In some countries however, regulations are in place to prevent banks and other financial firms from entering the market. Government regulation is generally stringent, with the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA) - Pénzügyi Szervezetek Állami Felügyelete (PSZÁF) - responsible for overseeing companies in this market and other financial institutions, thus limiting market entries by imposing capital adequacy and other requirements on players. The likelihood of new entrants is assessed as moderate.  There are a number of alternatives to taking out an insurance policy, i.e. in form of other financial products, such as savings and investments. Savings and investments include deposits, mutual funds and direct investments in equities and bonds. Wills are also a way of accounting for risk and protecting family members after death. These options could be a cheaper alternative to life insurance, but savings do not guarantee protection in the same way as life insurance, which reduces the benefit of this option. Consumers can adopt risk management strategies, such as 'Self-Insurance', whereby an eligible risk is retained, but a calculated amount of money is set aside. An organization could choose to operate its own 'captive' structure and form its own insurance company subsidiary. Although these are viable substitutes they require a certain amount of expertise and capital. The threat of substitutes with respect to the non-life insurance market is therefore assessed as weak.  There is now a unified insurance market in the European Union, as a result of the EU's Insurance Mediation Directive. This acts as a single ""passport"" for entities selling insurance within the EU. The life insurance market is fairly fragmented, with several smaller companies in business alongside the majors. Players within the life insurance market offer similar services but some are diversified, and pursue a number of non-life insurance lines, which tends to ease rivalry to some extent. The leading players are large companies offering similar life products, although there are a number of different plans including temporary, permanent and various subclasses. Because of the homogenous nature of the leading players insurance has become more like a commodity - an area in which an insurance company with a low cost structure, greater efficiency and better customer service will beat out competitors. Entry barriers, though not insignificant, are lower than exit barriers. For example, the regulatory system, through the imposition of such measures as capital adequacy, is designed to prevent insurers from going out of business, as this would be to the detriment of policyholders. When exit barriers in a market are high, players may weather poor market conditions where necessary - but this tends to boost rivalry. Insurance companies also use higher investment returns and a variety of insurance investment products to try to lure in customers. This leads to greater consolidation within the market. Larger companies prefer to take over or merge with other companies rather than spend the money to market and advertise to people. Overall, there is moderate rivalry in the market.  This section contains brief overviews of the leading companies in the Hungarian life insurance market.

923,THE CREDIT SPIES MAKING MILLIONS OUT OF WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE,"PETER and Judith Lewis have never had any money troubles. They've paid off their mortgage, promptly meet any bills, and never run up debts.

So, when they decided to switch to a better current account deal last month, they expected the move to be plain sailing.
But the couple were left humiliated when Nationwide called and said they had been turned down: their custom was not welcome. They were told a bad debt was to blame.  Mr Lewis, 70, a retired flight engineer, says: 'We had never been turned down for anything before. I couldn't understand what had happened.'  They pleaded with Nationwide to find out what had gone wrong. Finally, they were advised to check their credit report. When it arrived, it showed they had failed to repay £336 on a Nationwide credit card in 2008.  Mr Lewis say: 'The record was simply not right. We'd been victims of fraud while on holiday in Australia and the card had been cancelled. I rang the credit reference company and said: ""You've libelled me."" We were so angry with them.  'Had we needed a mortgage, we couldn't have got one. We felt we were blamed for something that wasn't our fault.'  Credit reports, and the agencies that compile these records, have taken over our lives. They hold data on every adult in the UK and use this information to rack up vast profits. So powerful are these firms, it is impossible to move home, change mobile phone or switch current account without their say so.  But when the information held by the credit agencies is wrong, the effects can be devastating. What's more, the information can prove almost impossible to change.  THE BIG NAMES THAT RULE YOUR LIFE  The three main credit reference agencies in Britain are Experian, Callcredit and Equifax, who put together huge databases of information supplied by banks, energy companies and mobile phone firms.  On top of this, they add details such as where you live, which they take from the electoral roll. The idea is that this gives a complete picture of how you spend your money, what your habits are and how good you are at repaying debts.  Firms pay the agencies to see this data. They can then use it, along with their own information, to make decisions about whether to accept you as a customer.  Your details are worth a fortune.  Experian is a FTSE 100 company with headquarters in Dublin and offices in Nottingham. Last year, it took revenues of £539 million in the UK (up from £479 million in 2011). It had no UK corporation tax bill, and instead got a credit of £159 million from the Treasury. It said the tax credit related to losses racked up in previous years.  Equifax, which is based in the U.S., in Atlanta, Georgia, reported that revenues from the UK increased by 6 pc last year to £87 million.  Callcredit, which was founded by Skipton Building Society but is now owned by a private equity firm, saw its operating profits jump by 40 pc last year to £17.3 million.  A real money-spinner for the firms is the masses of information they hold on you: everything from whether you have claimed on your insurance policies to the kind of savings account you use.  Callcredit boasts it holds the personal details of 43 million people. This includes 26 million residential addresses, 20 million landline numbers and 15 million mobile numbers.  Among the data it may know about you are the ages of your children, the angle of your garden (useful information for firms that sell solar panels or satellite dishes), whether you have a burglar alarm fitted, the make and mileage of your car, how much you spend on wine, sports and vitamins, if you gamble, where you go on holiday and what you read.  These details aren't on your credit file but are collected because they're a gold mine for any company that wants to sell you something.  These personal details are then sold to marketing companies by middle-men called data resellers. Callcredit says that 95 pc of all data resellers use its service. A further chunk of profits comes from selling complex computer programs to businesses, allowing them to interpret the details in your credit report. These programs are what bank staff use when you apply for a loan.  Not only do they allow them to decide whether to lend to you, but they can also indicate whether you will be a profitable customer.  Experian sells a program that alerts your bank if you are likely to need more credit in the near future. Based on this, the banks will be able to flog you a new credit card or loan.  Equifax uses your data to allow insurers to see if you may be a risky customer. It has a similar service for energy suppliers — allowing them to highlight anyone whose record shows that they had failed to repay a bill. All three firms run tracing services to track down people who have defaulted on bills.  A final money-making ploy is to get you to subscribe to see your file. By law, credit reference firms must give you your credit report for £2 by post, or £4 over the phone. The agencies say they don't make money from these reports.  They show just a very basic list of your current address, any financial agreements you have, your credit limits, and whether you have repaid on time dating back over the past six years.  But the agencies also encourage you to sign up to services that claim to let you analyse your file and improve it by taking out certain types of loans and credit cards.  Experian charges £9.99 a month, and Equifax £9.99. Callcredit offers a free service called Noddle. However, with Experian's service, for example, anyone who signs up is pointed to a list of credit cards they could apply for.  WHO WATCHes THE CREDIT spIES?  Michael Cole, 65, a businessman from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, had never checked his credit report until last year. He was planning to buy a new buy-to-let property and became worried when the bank he had applied to for a mortgage started asking increasingly detailed personal questions.  So, he checked his credit file with Equifax and uncovered a list of errors.  It said he had lived at a previous address for three years, when it was in fact 25, and it incorrectly claimed he owed BT £89.  His current credit card wasn't listed but lists of credit and store cards that he had closed years ago were.  It took Mr Cole five months to resolve the errors. The dispute forced him to put the buy-to-let project on hold. He says: 'I have asked where Equifax got the information from. They never told me.  'The whole system appears to be out of control and unregulated. There are no penalties for damage caused by the errors of these companies, yet the impact they can have on people's lives is devastating.'  Correcting wrong information on your credit file can be hugely inconvenient, and leave you struggling financially. The system is weighted in favour of the banks. It is up to you to spot errors and fight them.  The agencies say they constantly check information. They argue they make very few errors compared with the amount of data they process  However, a survey by consumer group Which? found that as many as one in eight credit reports is incorrect.  Britain's biggest High Street names treat your credit report as gospel, and however much you protest they won't budge until it is corrected at source.  But you can't change your credit file yourself . The only alteration you can make is to put a note of no more than 200 words next to the black mark.  Only the bank, insurance company or mobile phone provider that filed the incorrect record can change it, so you must take up the dispute with them through the credit reference agencies.  Banks have 28 days to investigate. If they fail to resolve your problem, your record will remain incorrect — though it may be marked as disputed.  After this you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.  The Information Commissioner's Office also checks whether the credit agencies and the banks are complying with the Data Protection Act.  the shop staff who can see your file  There are no official rules over who can see your data. The only proviso is that they are part of a firm that has subscribed to the credit reference agency database and that there is a legitimate reason why they would need to see it.  Any staff who can access your file must abide by the Data Protection Act. However, they do not have to undergo training or hold any qualifications before they can see your file — though many big banks and insurance companies do insist on this.  You must give permission for your report to be accessed — but it is possible you can do this unwittingly as it often forms part of an application for a loan, credit card or mobile phone.  In reality, most of the time an organisation does a credit check on you, the person viewing your file cannot see your specific personal details.  What they are looking at will be a rating given to you by that company's computer systems, which have analysed your details. This may be as simple as 'accept' or 'reject'.  This is the practice with most High Street names. However, the growth of credit files has raised concerns over how smaller firms can use your details, and whether anyone from a secretary to a director can see your record.  All the credit agencies stress that they make every effort to protect the personal information. A spokesman from Experian says: 'Our work is closely regulated and we  * Public information, such as your address, or electoral roll details  * Credit card and loan borrowing and repayments  * Some mobile phone bills  * Some water and energy bills  * Payday loans  * Court records  * Details of debts owed at previous addresses  * Fraud allegations  © Daily Mail",1,,,0.0,0
926,Why is an RRSP a good idea?,"rrsPs are relatively easy to set up. you can make arrangements through financial advisors, financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, or have investment brokers or financial planners help you find the right plan for you and assist you with the paperwork. you can let an advisor choose and manage your investments, or you can take a more active role by setting up a self-directed rrsP.

""an rrsP helps you save for retirement and gives you an immediate tax benefit when you make a contribution to it,"" says Bruce Barran, cPa, ca, a partner with davis martin-dale llP in london. ""That tax deduction helps you reduce your taxable income for the year in question. it's a key benefit for people who contribute to rrsPs. Plus, the income you earn in the rrsP is only taxed when you withdraw the funds at a later date. ideally, you make rrsP contributions when you are in a higher tax bracket and withdrawals when you are in a lower one.""
a few things to note when considering an rrsP, you must have a social insurance number and earned income to start an rrsP. Why is that? your previous year's employment income is used to determine contribution room for the current tax year. For 2014, each taxpayer's annual contribution room is calculated as 18 per cent of their 2013 earned income, to a max imum of $24,270, less any required pension adjustments. The contribution limit increases to $24,930 for the 2015 taxation year. also, any unused contribution room from previous years is carried for-ward, so the amount that you can contribute may be even higher.  ""your rrsP can include many kinds of investments, such as Gics, stocks, bonds and mutual funds,"" Barran explains. ""Government pensions are not enough to retire on. you need to plan ahead for retirement and rrsPs are a good retirement savings vehicle.""  To decide whether or not an rrsP is right for you, consider your age, your current income level, the time you're likely to need to withdraw the funds for retirement, and what your tax rate is expected to be when the funds will be withdrawn. you should also consider if other options, such as a Tax-Free savings account or and registered education savings Plan, make more sense for your savings at this stage of your life.  To make an rrsP contribution and include the deduction on your 2014 personal tax return, you must make your contribution by march 2, 2015.  - - -  RRsP checklist  A social insurance number and earned income is needed to start an RRSP.  Contribute to an RRSP by March 2, 2015.Why? To qualify as a 2014 deduction, contributions to your personal or spousal RRSPs must be made by this date.  How much should you contribute? To determine your RRSP contribution limit for 2014, refer to your previous year's Notice of Assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), or visit the CRA website at www.cra-arc.gc.ca.  Note: For 2014, each taxpayer's annual contribution room is calculated as 18 per cent of their 2013 earned income, to a maximum of $24,270, less any required pension adjustments.  Determine what amount, if any, you have already contributed to your RRSP for 2014.You may have made contributions throughout the year, or have unused contribution room from previous years that you can use, up to your 2014 RRSP contribution limit.  Remember to consider group RRSPs. You will receive a 2014 tax deduction for this amount as long as the contribution is made by the deadline.  Watch the mail for your receipts. If you're filing a paper income tax return, you must attach receipts for all amounts contributed from March 4, 2014 to March 2, 2015 inclusive. This includes any amounts you are not deducting on your income tax and benefit return for 2014, and those you are designating as Home Buyers'Plan or Lifelong Learning Plan repayments.",1,,,1.0,1
933,Bill could cause increased water pollution,"INDIANAPOLIS – A bill making its way through the statehouse would simplify regulations for developers, but critics say it's at the cost of Indiana's water quality.

HB 1266 would prohibit cities and other government entities that approve construction projects from requiring erosion control measures ""more stringent"" than what is required by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management.
That will likely save construction companies money but result in more pollution — including sediment, fertilizer and construction chemicals — flowing untreated from construction sites through stormwater systems and straight into Indiana waterways.  ""These sites are gaping wounds of pollution,"" said Jill Hoffman, executive director of the White River Alliance. ""I just don't understand why we're not on the same page about this. People want to buy places that were thoughtfully developed and have a sustainable future.""  How the stormwater system works  The stormwater systems used by many cities and towns across the state contribute to the problem.  The so-called municipal separate storm sewer systems, or MS4s, are needed to whisk stormwater from urbanized areas, where impermeable pavement increases the risk of flooding. But the underground pipes also wash whatever they contact — cigarette butts, oil slicks and trash — directly into Indiana streams, rivers and lakes.  Sediment gets washed away, too, and sediment from construction sites is particularly troublesome. The degree of disturbance on the sites loosens the dirt in such a way that, with the right amount of rain and lack of prevention, sediment washes into stormwater systems at a rate 10-20 times the rate it would leave a farm field.  So the Environmental Protection Agency requires cities and towns with such systemsto develop and enforce best management practices to reduce pollutants and runoff.  The EPA and the IDEM require site plan review of construction sites where an acre of land or more will be disturbed. And some of the more than 150 Indiana communities with such stormwater systems require reviews of smaller sites.  A rule in Hamilton County, for example, requires stormwater protection plans for sites smaller than one acre as long as the site is part of a larger development. So if a subdivision is being developed lot by lot, the contractor will still have to produce plans for those smaller plots. That's because, while smaller sites might not introduce a large amount of sediment pollution into surrounding waterways, the cumulative runoff can be significant.  Developers and contractors say the varied array of rules across the state is a burden. It forces them to navigate several dozen different entities all with their own rules and processes, said Rick Wajda, chief executive officer of the Indiana Builders Association.  ""A lot of these MS4s have taken Rule5 (which governs construction runoff in Indiana) and added additional requirements that add costs,"" he said.  Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, authored the bill, but did not respond to multiple interview requests. Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Syracuse, is sponsoring the bill in the state Senate. He declined to be interviewed through a Senate press contact.  Some groups argue that home rule allows local operators to make decisions that best fit their unique waterways and landscapes, which vary greatly across the state.  ""What happens is that the locals might have a local resource they're trying to protect,"" said Lori Gates, chair of the board of directors for Indiana Association for Floodplain and Stormwater Management.  One thing many Hoosiers may not realize, Gates said, is that sediment is the main pollutant of concern from construction sites. It's the top pollutant by volume, flowing off of construction sites at a rate up to 2,000 times that of forest lands.  The sediment can carry harmful pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and construction chemicals, but it can also cause damage all on its own.  ""Too much sediment can suffocate the life out of our waterways,"" Gates said.  Real life example: Indian Lake  Mark Rumreich knows this issue first hand. He's been the president of the Indian Lake Improvement Association in northeast Marion County for several years. The organization consists of local residents, who pay an average of $1,000 every year to maintain the lake.  Most of that money goes toward dredging the lake, which receives runoff from a 25-square-mile watershed. Some of the sedimentation is natural, but over the years, increased development in the area has dramatically increased the amount of silt in the lake.  If Rumreich's association didn't dredge the lake, ""it would turn into a marsh or a swamp,"" he said. ""That's not what we signed up for.""  Dredging became so costly that the association bought its own dredging equipment to keep costs low. Rumreich said they began sending members out as ""watershed watchdogs"" to monitor construction sites and take photos of violations. He said that they'd try to work with developers to bring them into compliance, but in some cases they resorted to legal action.  They filed their first lawsuit in 2006 against the Indiana Department of Transportation and its subcontractors for failing to take proper erosion control measures while working on an expansion of Pendleton Pike. A soil scientist hired by the Indian Lake Improvement Association said lax erosion control measures sent 3,280 tons of sediment into the lake, forming what locals called ""INDOT Island."" A contractor quoted the cost of removing the sediment at more than $270,000.  The state ultimately settled the case for about $254,000.  A confusing system for developers  More than 150 communities in Indiana have these types of systems, each with the authority to set its own rules. Even forms and stop work processes could be different from town to town.  That causes confusion and ultimately costs Hoosier homeowners and developers, said Wajda of the Indiana Builders Association.  ""Roughly 25 percent of the cost of a house can be tied back to regulations, so that's regulations,"" he said. ""So we're cognizant of that. Certainly in Indiana and across the country there is a challenge to providing affordable housing. We want to make sure we keep Indiana at a competitive advantage.""  In addition to restricting home rule, Rep. Miller's bill would also require local entities to make decisions on construction plans within five business days. Currently, IDEM has 28 days to review similar construction plans.  The bill would require 72-hour written notice of a stop work order in the case of an alleged violation so that developers have a chance to address the issue without shutting down.  Finally, the bill would require plans to be reviewed by an individual that is a civil engineer, architect, or has been otherwise trained to oversee MS4 system.  Hoffman of the White River Alliance agreed that there is work to be done to standardize parts of the process for developers, but that restricting home rule is not the way to do it. Likewise, she said the bill's other provisions do little to address developers' concerns without taking power away from local authorities.  ""I think we can make some strides helping home builders have some expectations,"" she said, including standardizing forms and stop work processes. But there's a reason different communities have different rules. ""We can't ignore that this is a significant pollution problem,"" she said.  HB 1266 is a version of a 2018 bill that would have prohibited MS4 communities from imposing construction site erosion regulations more stringent than what is laid out in the Clean Water Act. That bill passed out of the House but died in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee.  This year's version was passed by the House an now headed to the Senate.

936,Connecticut Law Strengthens Mortgage Lock-in Requirements  ,"HARTFORD, CT -- Prior to leaving office, former Connecticut Gov. John Rowland, signed a Senate bill into law regarding mortgage rate lock-ins.  

The bill strengthens and updates mortgage rate lock-in requirements to reflect current industry practices, according to the Washington law firm Lotstein Buckman LLP.  
The legislation repeals and amends existing statutes and creates a new section prohibiting mortgage brokers from collecting rate lock-in fees under certain circumstances.    Among other changes, this bill includes first mortgage correspondent lenders in the definition of a ""mortgage lender"" and includes lines of credit in the definition of a ""loan,"" for the purposes of the mortgage rate lock-in statutes.    The bill also explicitly allows a mortgage rate lock-in to include electronically transmitted confirmations stating mortgage rates and allows the applicant's representative, in addition to the applicant himself, to receive such a confirmation.    Connecticut law previously prohibited mortgage lenders from entering into a mortgage rate lock-in agreement unless the agreement was in writing. The Senate bill eliminates this requirement by also allowing for electronically transmitted confirmations.    The bill also prohibits a lender from committing to a first mortgage loan applicant or his representative that the lender will make a loan at a specified rate if the loan is closed by the expiration of a specified period of time except by issuing a mortgage rate lock-in.    The law adds a new provision to the Connecticut statutes, prohibiting a mortgage broker from collecting a rate lock-in fee, except where a governmental agency requires the broker to collect the fee directly.    It prevents them from issuing a mortgage rate lock-in or otherwise representing to a first mortgage loan applicant or his representative that the loan will be made at a specified rate if it is closed by a certain time.    But the legislation does specify that a mortgage broker may provide a mortgage lender's mortgage rate lock-in to an applicant or his representative on the lender's behalf and collect a rate lock-in fee, payable to the lender, on the lender's behalf.

Americans will be able to save just a little bit more in some of their retirement accounts in 2020.
The Internal Revenue Service announced it is increasing its 401(k), 403(b) and most Thrift Savings Plans deferred contribution limit to $19,500 next year, up from $19,000 in 2019. Catch up contributions are also jumping $500, to $6,500 in 2020. That means Americans 50 years and older can contribute a total of $26,000 in 2020.  The maximum contribution for individual retirement accounts will remain at $6,000, as will the catch-up contribution for those accounts (at $1,000). SIMPLE plans are going up to $13,500 next year, from $13,000 in 2019.  The IRS has also adjusted the income limits for eligible deductions of IRA contributions. The phase-out range determines if a taxpayer can claim a deduction on their federal income tax return for their IRA contributions — someone who earns between the range would be limited in what they can claim, whereas someone earning past the range would not be able to claim a deduction. Taxpayers who are not covered by an employer-sponsored plan can deduct their contributions in full, according to the IRS.  The new limits, beginning Jan. 1, 2020, are as follows:  The phaseout range for single account holders of traditional IRAs and heads of household who are active participants of a plan is $65,000 to $75,000;  For married couples filing jointly, where the spouse who makes the IRA contribution is an active participant in a qualified account, the phase-out range is between $104,000 and $124,000;  For an IRA contributor who is not an active participant but is married to someone who is, the range is $196,000 and $206,000;  And for married individuals filing separately, the phase-out range for an active participant remains at $0 to $10,000.  See:It’s going to be easier to make early 401(k) withdrawals, but should you do it?  Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars, have separate income limits and no deductions, and are held to these phase-out ranges for making contributions:  In 2020, singles and heads of households have an adjusted gross income range between $124,000 and $139,000;  Married taxpayers filing jointly have a phase-out range between $196,000 and $206,000;  And for married individuals filing separately, the phase-out remains at $0 to $10,000.  The total contribution limit to 401(k) and similar plans increased to $57,000, up from $56,000, and would include employee contributions as well as employer contributions.  Many Americans don’t max out their 401(k) plans. Only 13% of participants did so in 2017, when the limit was $18,000, according to a 2018 Vanguard report about its investors, and they were typically participants who had higher incomes, were older and had a longer tenure at their employers. Comparatively, 9.1% of Fidelity investors with a 401(k) plan had maxed out their accounts in 2018, up from 9% in 2017 and 8.1% at the end of 2013.

941,"WSJ: US States, Facing Budget Deficits, Look To Hybrid Pensions","State governments, the last bastion of guaranteed pensions, are increasingly looking to the 401(k)-style plans that dominate the private sector.

Some new state workers in Michigan and Utah will soon begin to receive part of their retirement benefits from a 401(k)-type plan, after lawmakers there recently voted to adopt plans that combine a 401(k) component with a guaranteed benefit.
These hybrid plans are a cost-cutting measure for states seeking to pare back the guaranteed retirement payments considered a bedrock benefit for government workers. In down markets, the plans could mean less-generous benefits for these workers, who have sidestepped the market volatility many of their private-sector counterparts endured in recent years.  Utah and Michigan join six other states that have some form of hybrid plans for public workers. Most of those states, including Oregon and Washington, set up hybrid plans within the past 15 years.  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)  A number of other states, facing looming pension-fund liabilities, have expressed interest in hybrid plans, industry participants say. Some officials in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, for instance, are contemplating a move to a hybrid plan.  ""Reality is not negotiable,"" said Utah state Sen. Dan Liljenquist, a Republican who was instrumental in crafting the legislation for the pension changes in that state. ""The fact is somebody bears the risk. Ultimately, the state is bearing more risk than it can.""  Total unfunded public-pension liabilities in the U.S. increased to $457.8 billion in fiscal year 2008 from $368.5 billion in 2007, according to a June report by Standard & Poor's, citing the most complete data available. States have taken various measures to bridge that funding gap, including scaling back cost-of-living adjustments, increasing monthly contributions from employees toward their pensions or extending the retirement age. Often the changes affect only new hires.  In the search for other ways to tackle the problem, these hybrid plans can represent a middle ground. Since they maintain a defined-benefit plan for workers, the hybrid plans can help lawmakers skirt the political backlash that could accompany any threat to a defined-benefit plan, while they move some of the investment risk to employees.  Though it isn't a booming trend, ""hybrids are being looked at now more than ever before,"" said Cathie Eitelberg, senior vice president and public-sector practice leader at Segal Co., whose clients include government pension funds.  ""The opponents of defined-benefit plans have been out there for a long time"" and, given recent market losses, ""the agenda is just ripe for downsizing,"" she added.  In Utah, where state employers were facing rising contribution rates, new workers as of July 1, 2011, can choose to enroll in a defined-contribution plan--such as a 401(k)--or a hybrid plan. In the hybrid plan, workers can invest in a 401(k)-type fund. State and employee contributions to the defined-benefit portion of the hybrid plan fluctuate based on the financing of the pension fund. The state contribution is capped at 10% in both plans.  In Michigan, new school employees as of July 1 will contribute 2% of monthly income to a 401(k)-type fund, with state employers matching up to 1% of pay. Employees are automatically enrolled in the fund, but can choose to opt out or choose to contribute more.  There is still a defined benefit component, but it will cost the state less: Public employers will contribute on average 2.5% of an employee's monthly income toward retirement, down from an average base of 4%. There is no longer a cost-of-living adjustment.  Retirement officials think that change may encourage new workers to remain in the 401(k)-type fund in order to try to make up for the lost annual bump.  ""We hope to create a culture of savings"" with the defined-contribution component, said Phil Stoddard, director of Michigan's Office of Retirement Services. The 401(k) component makes the benefit plan attractive for younger workers who are unlikely to remain in one job for 30 years, Stoddard said.  Some workers aren't enthralled. ""It's less benefit overall because of the variability of that 401(k) component,"" said Doug Pratt, director of communications for the Michigan Education Association, a union representing 130,000 school employees.  The reduced benefits mean ""we're going to lose some good people"" who will find the benefits package less attractive, Pratt said. But a hybrid plan is ""certainly a better alternative than ditching pensions all together.""  The vast majority of public-sector employees have a defined-benefit plan--79% in 2008, according to the most recent data available from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit research institute in Washington. In comparison, 33% of private-sector employees were enrolled in a defined-benefit plan in the same period.  In 2008, 18% of state workers had a defined-contribution plan, compared with 55% of private-sector workers enrolled in a defined-contribution plan.  The heightened interest in hybrid plans doesn't appear to foreshadow a swift change toward defined-contribution plans. Though defined-contribution plans are often on legislative agendas, they rarely have been adopted in the public sector, said Ron Snell, director of the state-services division for the National Conference of State Legislatures.  Only Alaska and the District of Columbia have mandatory defined-contribution plans for all workers, according to a June report by Snell.  -By Jeannette Neumann, The Wall Street Journal; jeannette.neumann@wsj.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  July 09, 2010 17:58 ET (21:58 GMT)",1,,,0.0,0
943,How to foot the bill for a college education,"When it comes to paying for your children's college, the best advice is to start saving early and often.

""The earlier you start, the easier it is to achieve your goal,"" said Jud Powell, a financial advisor with Edward Jones in Abilene. ""That's exactly right. If you have a goal in mind, there are so many tools available to you.""
Powell said there are websites available that can estimate how much money you'll need by plugging in the name of the school and the year the child will be attending. A word of caution, however, about how high that figure could be.  ""I was talking to some grandparents about it and they said their grandkids wanted to go to Clemson because they live in South Carolina,"" said Powell. ""We looked at the cost and they said, 'There's no way.' I said, 'Yes, there is, because we've always had inflation.""  If people start early, Powell said one of the best tools is a college 529 plan, which allows you to put the money in the child's name and withdraw it tax free when the time comes.  If, for whatever reason, the child doesn't need the money for college, the plan can be put in another child's name with no penalty. Also, if the child is in college, the money doesn't have to go toward tuition. It can also be used for any other expenses associated with college.  For people who haven't started saving early for their children's college education and find it looming in front of them, Powell said it would be a mistake to borrow from a retirement account to pay for college, regardless of how attractive that may look at the time.  ""That's a bad idea for two reasons,"" he said. ""You have to pay taxes on it. And, if you're under 59 and a half, you have to pay an extra 10 percent penalty. You end up only getting about 75 cents for every dollar.""  There's another reason why Powell advises against that. You can borrow money for college. You can't borrow money for retirement.  Taking out of the retirement fund to pay for college could change your retirement plans by forcing you to work longer or by changing your standard of living in your retirement.  With the cost of a college education, one would think that most people would try to plan for it.  ""You'd be surprised at the number of people who don't,"" said Powell. ""A young person doesn't think 18 years is ever going to get here and they think they have plenty of time. It's like buying insurance for assisted living. We know we need to do it, but we put it off.""  For people who find themselves unprepared for the cost of college, there are some other options, said Lori Herrick, Director of Financial Aid at McMurry University.  ""How a student does in high school is important, not just their GPA, but extra curriculars and community service. They need to begin looking at scholarships that are available to them aggressively during their senior year.""  There are other ways that students can defray the cost of their college education. One is by taking dual credit courses while in high school. However, Herrick offered a caveat to that plan.  ""One thing to understand is that the child is going to be in an upper-level class and is still just 18 years old,"" she said. ""If they can handle that, dual credit is a great idea.""  Another option is for a student to attend a junior college for the first year to get those courses out of the way without incurring a huge debt.  A student also needs to be prepared to get through college in four years by taking advantage of block tuition, which most colleges charge.  Under block tuition, said Herrick, 12 hours cost as much as 18 hours.  ""We want students to be successful,"" said Herrick.",1,,,0.0,1
944,Long quest for small sum,"THE CRUSADER

READER Mr T Affleck, of Poole, Dorset, was concerned for some years about a sum of just under £200 in his pension fund. He first wrote to Scottish Widows about it in May 1998. ""I regret that our contract is with the trustees and I cannot enter into correspondence with individual members, "" an assistant wrote back.
Mr Affleck contacted the trustees and wrote to them again when he retired in December 2002 but received no reply on either occasion. In February this year he wrote again to Scottish Widows. No reply again. ""It is only a small pension, "" he told The Crusader, ""but it would be nice to know when, or if, I am going to receive it.""  We tried to contact the trustees but had as little success as Mr Affleck, so we got in touch with Scottish Widows.  Its customer relations manager replied promptly with a copy of a letter he was sending to Mr Affleck. ""The last contact we had with them [the trustees] was in 2002, "" he admitted, ""since when all correspondence has been returned marked 'gone away'. We do not therefore know their whereabouts or what the position is regarding their circumstances.  ""However, a decision has been taken that, in the apparent absence of the trustees, we will deal directly with the individual members of the scheme.""  This week, we heard from Mr Affleck again. ""Scottish Widows has offered me £231.81. You have achieved in a few weeks what I have tried to do for 18 months.

Yorkshire Building Society have released first-time buyer super deals that will help those who are desperate to get a foothold into the property ladder.
It's been an increasing issue for younger generations who have seen higher rent and lower wages.  Yet now, even for those with a small deposits, there are more opportunities and benefits.  To get the latest email updates from Yorkshire Live,  click here  .  The Yorkshire Building Society has now launched two new mortgages exclusively for those taking their first step on the property ladder.  The society will now be giving the option for new fee-free mortgages at 90% loan to value LTV.  Both mortgages come with free standard valuation and £1,000 cashback.  Ben Merritt, senior mortgage manager at Yorkshire Building Society, said: “First-time buyers are the lifeblood of the housing market and we’re committed to supporting them to help people realise their homeownership ambitions.  “These new mortgages have been designed for first-time buyers looking for low upfront costs and who would value £1,000 cashback.  Search for houses for sale or rent near you  ""Buying your first house is a thrilling but expensive milestone, so we’ve included a significant cashback on completion incentive to help people make their first house a home.  “We’ve also made changes to benefit all borrowers requiring 90% LTV, and are offering a number of competitive rates, incentives and completion fees to give people more options and allow them to tailor their mortgage to meet their needs.”  Yorkshire Building Society's two-year fixed rate mortgage for first-time buyers comes with a rate of 3.54%, while those looking for a longer term deal can choose a five-year fixed rate of 3.64%.

970,New loans provide a different property option  ,"HOMEBUYERS are about to be offered loans worth more than the property they intend to buy.  

Borrowers who opt for a Head Start Shared Equity loan from Mobius Financial Services will be offered loans worth between 2 and 5 per cent more than the property they want to buy, in return for sharing any capital gains with the lender.  
Mobius Financial Services is a subsidiary of Wizard Home Loans and the loan will be made available at Wizard Home Loans from late November.    The loan, available to owner-occupiers only, will help homebuyers pay for transaction costs such as legal fees, stamp duty and mortgage insurance as well as the property.    The funds for transaction costs do not need to be repaid until the loan is discharged.    But borrowers will have to share between 20 and 50 per cent of any capital gain with the lender the proportion will depend on how much is borrowed to pay for transaction costs.    Borrowers will be charged a variable rate of 7.69 per cent on the amount they borrow to pay for the property (not the money borrowed to pay for transaction costs).    It is likely the new loans will appeal to first-home buyers and recently divorced people.    Wizard Home Loans executive chairman Mark Bouris said the new loan would allow more people to enjoy the benefits of home ownership.    ""We've done analysis that shows that in a property market with steady price growth, unlike what we've seen in the past five years, a person who borrows 102 per cent of the purchase price comes out ahead of a renter who waits to save up a deposit and buy in three years time,"" Mr Bouris said.

984,Barron's Mailbag: No Relief in Debt  ,"To the Editor:  

The Editorial Commentary of Dec. 5, ""Indebted to Debt,"" concludes that the bloated credit-card balances of America's families are ""a necessary evil"" that enable people to ""survive financial mishaps."" With all due respect, that is like saying another hit of heroin will enable an addict to have a good day. To rationalize credit-card debt as necessary misses the bigger problem: Average Americans are consuming way beyond their means. They spend because they believe they need a car that makes them adventurous, jewelry that makes them attractive, and that a 42-inch high-definition plasma television is a necessity. Americans spend because they buy what advertisers are selling, and they want it now.  
Don Allen Wilks    Euless, Texas    To the Editor:    Thanks for pointing out that the overwhelming majority of borrowers use debt responsibly and for important purchases, not just whimsical consumption. The commentary also brought to mind a statement by the late real-estate developer William Zeckendorf who, when asked about credit limits accompanied by lower interest rates, said something like: ""Better to be alive at 18% than dead at 12%"".

998,NHS staff opting out of pensions,"CONCERNS have been raised over an ""epidemic"" of workers opting out of the NHS pension scheme.

Workers who opt out could be giving up pensions worth around nine times what they save, Royal London warned.
It said a recent Freedom of Information (FOI) request by the Health Service Journal found nearly a quarter of a million (245,561) NHS staff had opted out of the NHS pension scheme in the past three years.  A nurse earning £25,000 annually who opted out for a year could save £1,420 by doing so. But it would cost a lump sum of around £13,000 - roughly nine times the £1,420 saving - to fill the pension hole caused by that one year of lost pension in retirement, Royal London said.  When people opt out they also give up large employer contributions into their pension pot.  Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now director of policy at Royal London, said: ""The NHS as an employer needs to take urgent action to tackle this epidemic of pension opt-outs.  ""All public sector workers have faced a squeeze on their takehome pay in recent years, but it is in the NHS where this has translated into shockingly high numbers of people leaving the pension scheme.""",1,,,1.0,1
1012,"Compensation scheme 'let down 82,000 pensioners'","Government rules punish many whose old employers went bust. Ruth Emery reports

THOUSANDS of workers whose final salary pensions fell into a government-backed compensation scheme have had their payments frozen for life — even though younger members are enjoying annual increases.
A Sunday Times investigation has discovered that due to a quirk in the compensation rules, more than 82,000 pensioners are being denied a full annual rise, with almost half suffering completely frozen payments in retirement.  Peter Sellers from Saddleworth in Oldham, Greater Manchester, worked for the construction group Dew Pitchmastic (formerly G Dew & Co) for 46 years. It was written into the terms of his pension scheme that he would receive 3% annual uplifts when he retired, to help keep pace with inflation. But after his scheme tipped into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) in 2010, he was shocked to find he would not receive any increases.""This freezing of the annual rise is unfairly and unjustly directed at older and the most vulnerable members only,"" he said. The 82-year-old called the rules, which are imposed on the PPF by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), ""draconian"" and ""distressing"".  The PPF was set up in 2005 to offer protection to members of generous defined-benefit schemes — which include final salary and career average plans — that are underfunded and whose employers are facing insolvency. So far, 754 schemes have been transferred to the PPF; some of the largest include UK Coal (July 2013) and Monarch Airlines (October 2014). Scheme members who are already receiving a pension typically enjoy 100% compensation from the PPF, with no upper limit. Those who have not yet retired, or who retired before reaching their scheme's normal pension age when their employer went bust, generally receive 90% of their pension. This is subject to a cap — currently £36,401 a year at the age of 65 (£32,761 when the 90% level is applied).  However, while pensioners continue to enjoy the same payments they received before their old employer went bust, they also suffer from a rule that means their pension may not increase each year.  Pension benefits built up from employment before April 1997 are not raised annually. This is because, before this date, schemes were not required by law to make inflation-related increases to pensions in payment, and, says the government, applying the same criterion to the PPF helps ensure that compensation does not exceed what the scheme would have originally provided.  According to a response to a Freedom of Information request, 82,201 PPF members have pre-1997 service, of whom 37,903 have pensions that were accrued only before April 1997. Their payments are frozen; those with a mix of pre and post-1997 work will have their annual uplifts reduced.  The uplift for pensionable service from April 2007 is based on inflation, subject to a maximum of 2.5% a year. For example, if a member received £12,000 a year from the PPF in 2010 and was not allowed annual increases, they would have lost more than £300 a year since then if the full 2.5% rise had been applied, and a total loss to date of £1,254.  Sellers is fighting to get the PPF rules changed. ""I recently heard of a quarry manager with my old company who, prior to his death at 87 in 2013, was upset at his treatment after many years of loyal service and concerned about the reduced and frozen pension he was leaving for his wife,"" he said.  Sellers took his pension from Dew in 1994 and, after setting up his own company, only fully retired in 2013. Over the past three years he has written to the PPF, the pensions minister Steve Webb, his own MP, Debbie Abrahams, as well as Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, to highlight ""blatant age discrimination"".  Faith Dickson, a partner at the pensions law firm Sackers, said: ""I always thought the PPF could be age discriminatory because the compensation system affects different age groups disproportionately. The PPF thinks it is protecting older members as they get 100% of their pensions if they are already retired, but many don't get annual increases.""  The DWP said: ""PPF compensation is increased in line with the legislation that applied to a member's original pension. Entitlement to indexation of compensation is not based on someone's age.""  Webb announced last summer that PPF members, who have not yet retired and belonged to a pension scheme for more than 20 years, would see annual limits increase 3% for every year of service after this landmark, up to a maximum of £63,000. The change has not yet come into effect.  The PPF has a surplus of £2.4bn. It is funded by a levy on pension schemes but hopes to be self-sufficient by 2030.",0,,,0.0,0
1026,Pa. voters to be asked: Is 70=plus too old fora judge?,"HARRISBURG - Would judges in their early 70s be too old? That question is now headed to Pennsylvania voters.

Having just elected three justices to the state's highest court this month, they will be asked to approve or reject a proposed constitutional amendment to raise the mandatory judicial retirement age from 70 to 75.
The Senate approved the measure Monday, joining the House in passing it in two consecutive legislative sessions - a requirement for a constitutional amendment. Voters are expected to consider the proposal in a referendum next year.  If passed, the retirement age would apply to all of the state's approximately 1,000 judges.  ""This is an issue that is happening not just in Pennsylvania, but around the country,"" said Lynn Marks, executive director of Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, a nonpartisan advocacy group that supports the amendment. ""More and more states are considering extending their age, and some states have eliminated their retirement age altogether.""  The referendum could have immediate implications. Three current Supreme Court justices - J. Michael Eakin, Thomas Saylor, and Max Baer - turn 70 in the next three years. A change in mandatory retirement age could extend their tenures or open the door for them to seek reelection.  Marks said recent scandals involving some Pennsylvania judges might persuade voters to vote against extending the age limit. Eakin, for example, is embroiled in a controversy over sending or receiving offensive emails.  ""It is important to have a strong discipline system to remove unfit judges of any age,"" Marks said.  Extending the retirement age to 75 reflects the reality that people work and live longer while continuing to allow opportunities for younger judges to bring ""ideas and energy"" with some regularity, she said.  The U.S. Supreme Court has no mandatory retirement age. Of its nine justices, four are older than 75.  mnussbaum@philly.com  610-313-8114  @MatthewNussbaum  electnext",0,,,1.0,1
1030,Money saving expert Martin Lewis reveals he's still ‘deeply scarred’ by his mother’s death 35 years on – and says he struggles to ‘remember anything but the pain’,"* Martin Lewis, 46, from Manchester, sadly lost his mother aged 11 years old

* The MoneySavingExpert claims his childhood 'died' when he lost his parent
* He found nobody spoke about the incident when he returned to school next day  * He's partnered with Grief Encounter to launch hotline for grieving children  Martin Lewis has revealed he still struggles to cope with his late mother's death and is 'deeply scarred' by the loss.  The MoneySavingExpert, 46, from Manchester, appeared on Loose Women today to discuss how he tragically lost his mum just before his 12th birthday, after she was involved in a horrific accident while horse riding with his sister.  In an emotional interview, Martin admitted he found it difficult to open up about the ordeal for decades, but after teaming up with the charity Grief Encounter, he hopes people will be able deal with grief better than he did.  'I am still now 35 years later deeply scarred,' he told the panel. 'It was a defining point in my life. It changed the way I act and behave. It was devastating. 'We didn’t know what to do. It was the mid 80s you didn’t do that type of thing. My father, my sister and I were incredibly wounded for such a long time.'  And his honesty touched a lot of hearts, with many viewers insisting his late mother would be 'proud' of him.  'Loose Women was a hard watch today,' penned one social media user. 'Martin Lewis you are truly fantastic. Your mom would be so proud.'  Today, the charity has launched a grief talk helpline to encourage children or parents to open up about their loss and to receive guidance in return - something close to Martin's heart.  Martin, who often gives advice on This Morning, revealed what made the death harder to come to terms with was that nobody at school even acknowledged the ordeal.  Speaking honestly on Loose Women today, he said: 'When I walked back to the classroom nobody said anything to me, and it was like it didn’t happen. It was as if I never had a mother who I had just lost.'  The expert is now a patron for Grief Encounter, but he admits he was reluctant at first.  'A few years ago Grief Encounter charity asked me to become a patron...initially I said no because I didn’t want to expose why I was relevant to be a patron,' he said.  'But I then agreed to be a patron, and then last year on Mother's day was the only time I agreed to talk about [on Radio 5 Live].  He continued: 'It was cathartic. I had a romantic break away with my wife, and I had tens and thousands of messages. It was like coming out of the grief closet. Talking about it is helpful. I am better at it now.  'I couldn’t even tell anyone what I had been through, but I can now admit it. When Grief Encounter had told me they wanted to set up a helpline I said, 'Let's do it. I'll pay for it.'  'It's free, it's confidential and it’s not just phones - it's online, chat and texts. We would like them to do it with parental permission, but you can pick it up and call and there will be someone to offer advice and guidance.'  And social media was flooded with messages in support of Martin Lewis - and many viewers commended him for opening up on such a sensitive topic.  'Felt very sad for Martin Lewis on #LooseWomen today,' wrote one. 'He is doing a great thing with the help line for others going through the loss of a parent as he did. The panel were visibly affected by his emotion and it was so sad.'  Another penned: 'This conversation with Martin Lewis, talking about losing his mum at age eleven is so moving. His devastation is palpable. It is so difficult for him to talk about and almost painful to watch. Brave man.'  A separate viewer empathised: '#Martin Lewis, very brave and heartfelt interview. I can totally understand all that you said as I lost my mum 27 years ago very suddenly when I was a teenager. I didn't really have anyone to talk to and I had to grow up overnight.'  Martin also admitted he found it hard to speak about his mother's death with his family, and it is only in recent years that he has been more open about it.  'I didn't talk to my father or sister about it because none of us could cope with this sudden change to our lives,' he explained. 'The next day she was gone.'  However, Martin - who has six-year-old daughter Sapphire with his wife Lara Lewington - is trying to teach himself to remember his 'wonderful' parent, rather than the pain he felt at a young age.  'I struggle to remember anything other than the pain,' he said. 'I am trying to remember the wonderful person I lost, not remember that I lost a wonderful person.'  'One of the lessons I learnt is that you feel guilty about feeling happy. Actually my philosophy now is you grab every moment of happiness you can possibly have.  He added: 'My mum was 35, she was so much younger than I am now when she went. I think God forbid something happens to me. The last thing I would want is the people who you love to be constantly upset and miserable and sad.'  'What we have to remember when we go through grief is how we want someone to remember us, we want them to miss us, and want them to care, but we wouldn't want them to be miserable and upset. They are things you can't see when the horrible fog of blackness is around you.'  Martin hopes his latest partnership and the new talk helpline will help others who have loved and lost.  'My message here is that I hope someone in my position in 35 years time, although you can't cure grief, won't have scars of the depth I do.'  Martin was touched by the positive response to his appearance on the daytime show.  He tweeted: 'Thank you for all the kind words about my appearance on #loosewomen. I can't respond to them all but they are touching.  'Still a little bit shaken. So taking a little bit of time out. Hopefully my @itvmlshow team won't be too annoyed if I'm a little late for our meet.'",0,,,0.0,0
1031,"Bush admits intel on Iraq `turned out to be wrong'; While taking responsibility, he maintains war was the right call","WASHINGTON - In an admission ahead of today's elections in Iraq, President Bush on Wednesday took responsibility for deciding to invade the country based on intelligence that later proved to be flawed. But he said he still believes ousting Saddam Hussein was justified.

""It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong,"" Bush said in the last of four speeches before today's Iraqi parliamentary elections. ""As president, I'm responsible for the decision to go into Iraq, and I'm also responsible for fixing what went wrong by reforming our intelligence capabilities.""
Declaring that Saddam was a threat the world is better off without, Bush said, ""We are in Iraq today because our goal has always been more than the removal of a brutal dictator; it is to leave a free and democratic Iraq in its place.""  Before a largely friendly audience at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Bush reviewed the reasons behind the 2003 invasion and presented a case for staying the course in Iraq until, he said, ""victory is achieved.""  ""When the history of these days is written, it will tell how America once again defended its own freedom by using liberty to transform nations from bitter foes to strong allies,"" Bush said.  Much is at stake for the president in today's balloting. While his own public approval ratings have recently seen slight improvements, overall support for the war remains at an all-time low.  Installing a fully functional, representative government amid continued violence and instability is a critical test of Iraq's fledging democracy.  In recent weeks, Bush has salted his speeches with acknowledgments of the setbacks and challenges of stabilizing Iraq, while sticking to a largely rosy assessment of progress.  He called today's vote a major turning point for the region.  ""We are living through a watershed moment in the story of freedom,"" Bush said. ""Iraqis will go to the polls to choose a government that will be the only constitutional democracy in the Arab world.""  Bush conceded during last year's presidential election that it appeared Saddam did not have the weapons of mass destruction originally cited by the administration as the primary justification for the war.  He argued Thursday that even putting that issue aside, there were plenty of reasons to wish Saddam out of power: for the good of the Iraqi people, for the future of the region and for national security at home.  ""The United States did not choose war. The choice was Saddam Hussein's,"" Bush said. ""Given Saddam's history and the lessons of September the 11th, my decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision.""  For some Democrats, Bush's revisiting of the reasons behind the invasion reopened the debate on how the war was justified at a time when many are calling for a timetable for a troop pullout. Forty Senate Democrats and an independent sent him a letter demanding he provide a plan and a schedule for withdrawal.  ""The president's speech today failed to provide the American people with any insight into his strategy for completing the mission,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said.  Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., whose criticism of Bush's handling of the war largely galvanized his party's opposition, expressed irritation at the president's continued linking of Sept. 11 and the war in Iraq, and his citing of Iraq's emerging democracy as a justification for the war.  ""We go to war because of our national security interests. We don't go to war to start democracy in another country,"" Murtha said. ""We go to war for one reason, and they keep mischaracterizing why we went to war by telling a history that turns out not to be true.""  Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said he hopes 2006 will prove a year of transition in Iraq, with security and other functions transferred back to that country, ""the sooner, the better.""",0,,,0.0,0

Chicago Exchange to Quote
Stock Prices in Sixteenths
","
CHICAGO -- Adding to the momentum to narrow stock spreads, the Chicago
Stock Exchange says it will quote New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks
in sixteenths of a dollar.



The Chicago Stock Exchange said yesterday it would narrow the minimum
increment at which it would quote stock prices to 1/16 from 1/8 as soon
as the necessary technological changes are made, expected by June 30.

 The Philadelphia Stock Exchange and Pacific Exchange have already said they plan to quote stocks in sixteenths. However, all three of the regional markets said they are waiting for enhancements to the Intermarket Trading System, which electronically links the country's stock exchanges, enabling brokers and specialists to access the best price for a stock regardless of where it is displayed.    The ITS agreed to make the technological enhancements to permit quotation of stocks in sixteenths last week. However, simply having the capability doesn't compel exchanges to quote or brokers or investors to trade in sixteenths. The New York Stock Exchange is studying the issue but as yet has no plans to move to sixteenths, a spokesman said. ",0,,,0.0,0
1045,City - HEDGE FUNDS - Should you hedge your bets? Sophisticated Investing They're not just for the rich ...,"City - HEDGE FUNDS - Should you hedge your bets? Sophisticated Investing They're not just for the rich but, says Paul Farrow, hedge funds have yet to catch on. 


	

Hedge funds were traditionally the preserve of institutional investors and super-rich individuals. But several recent entrants to the market offer ordinary investors a home for their #7,000 Isa allowance.  The companies that launched the funds - Deutsche Bank, Morley Fund Management, HSBC and Hendersons - all pointed out that hedge funds could deliver absolute returns when markets were falling - as they were at the time of launch.  But several months on, the signs are that hedge funds have yet to capture the private investor's imagination.  It is understood that Deutsche Bank's Xavex hedge fund, launched in February, has raised just #55m of its #200m target and HSBC European Absolute Return just #45m of its hoped-for #250m.  Other fund managers, who had been looking to join the hedge fund crowd, have decided to hold off because the UK investor is not yet considered to be ready for the concept.  Marketing efforts to lure investors were not helped by the Financial Services Authority which, in March, described hedge funds as ""exotic investments"" and warned that they were unregulated financial products.  ""The retail market has been disappointing,"" says Jacob Schmidt of Allenbridge, an independent financial adviser.  ""Deutsche and HSBC failed to get anywhere near their target. Pretty well every investment company was looking at hedge funds, but now they're holding back."" ",0,,,0.0,0

1052,Repossessions up  ,"The number of homes repossessed by banks and building societies last year rose to 17,000 says the Council of Mortgage Lenders who expect the 2007 figure to top the 19,000 mark following the further rounds of interest rate rises by the Bank of England. Last year 235,000 homebuyers admitted that they struggle to meet home loan repayments. The CML fears that the number of homeowners at least three months behind on mortgage payments is expected to go up by 23 per cent to 130,000.  

Costly DIY  
Essex homeowners who carry out their own do-it-yourself jobs in the home and end up botching are only costing themselves money when it comes to selling their property says the National Association of Estate Agents. Amateur workmanship not done properly could cost a homeowner as much as £5,000 for every room where they have unsuccessfully tried DIY says the association which also warns against owners carrying out so-called home improvement work, such as an extension, without first gaining the appropriate planning permisison from the local authority,    New loans for country homes    With mortgage lenders now re-launching a range of new loans following the recent surprise quarter-point rise in interest rates, the finance arm of Savills Estate Agents is now offering a an offset mortgage for City workers with huge bonuses who are looking to borrow a large amount of cash to buy a big country home. The rate is at 0.40 per cent under the base interest rate which means it works out at 4.85 per cent. It's available for up to 85 per cent LTV with a minimum loan of £200,000 whilst the maximum is £5m. The Savills Private Finance deal only charges for early repayment.

1053,18 States Eye New Retirement Plans For Private-Sector Workers,"Are you failing to save enough for retirement because you simply don't have access to a workplace retirement account? Two states -- California and Connecticut -- have moved ahead with preliminary plans to force employers to either set up one of the retirement plans that already exist -- such as a 401(k) -- or to adopt a proposed new type of plan, an automatic-enrollment IRA. And 18 states in total are studying such initiatives, but have not moved as far as California and Connecticut.

That head count of states mulling action that would force employers to act comes from a new study by the Center for Retirement Research (CRR) at Boston College.
The impetus for state action comes from the fact that about half of private sector workers are not covered by any employer-sponsored retirement plan, the CRR says.  Those workers not only lack access to a traditional pension plan -- which are becoming increasingly rare in the private sector -- but they also lack access to something like a 401(k).  ""Both states recognized that the key to the success of their programs -- both in terms of increasing retirement security and in terms of feasibility -- is achieving a large pool of participating employees,"" the CRR report said. In other words, to make such mandatory plans easy and cost-efficient for employers, the plans must attract lots of worker participants, to create economies of scale.  The Investment Company Institute, a trade group for mutual fund families, last week sent a letter to the California Legislature, urging the body to go slowly. The ICI advised the state not to overlook costs that would end up being foisted on workers or businesses. The ICI also advised against haste that could lead the state to ""(fail) to consider workforce demographics and other factors that could reduce the program's ability to expand retirement plan coverage.""  Also, the ICI cautioned against action that could lead to a patchwork of separate state programs. Instead, the group urged California and other states to ""build upon the national, voluntary private-sector system of tax-deferred employer plans"" like 401(k)s that already exist. ""Simple reforms on a national level can make retirement plans less costly and more attractive to employers, particularly smaller businesses, that don't offer plans today,"" the letter from ICI general counsel David W. Blass said.  In January the ICI sent a similar letter to the Department of Labor (DOL), criticizing its proposal for helping states create retirement plans for private-sector workers. The DOL proposal -- which would give legal authorization to the state plans -- would create ""a fragmented, state-by-state system of retirement plans.""  That approach would create confusion for workers and businesses. And it would lack the strict federal protections for existing plans like 401(k)s, the ICI said.",0,,,0.0,0
1054,Cash point,"The true cost of the new pension freedoms is that thousands of people are missing out on thousands of pounds worth of income. In the six months since the changes kicked in, 60% of those who bought an annuity (lifetime income) from savings didn't compare the market, and simply accepted the income from the pension firm they had saved with.

From an average annuity of £53,300, the best standard yearly income is £3,083. The lowest is £2,824 - that's £214 a year less or £4,280 over a 20-year retirement.
The freedoms are meant to prevent people from getting a duff deal on their hard-earned cash. Instead, they have led to confusion and inertia. Most people can boost incomes by 10% by simply shopping around, while those with health and lifestyle factors can get even more.  Andrew Tully, of Retirement Advantage, said: ""Despite measures to try and encourage better practice, the situation is getting worse, and the market is failing consumers.""",1,,,0.0,1
1060,finance -Three Reasons For Financial Worry -Try To Foresee The Unforseen.  ,"If you want some sleepless nights, here are 3 money dangers to worry about.  

1. Bad Ideas. As you decide how much to save each month and how to invest those dollars, you have to make assumptions about the future. For instance, lots of people presume stocks are sure to beat bonds, real estate always appreciates, saving 10% a year is enough, they will have steady employment until retirement and stocks will deliver 10% a year over the long run.But how solid are these assumptions? The fact is, the unthinkable happens all the time. The lesson: DonÕt bank too heavily on any one assumption, or your entire financial strategy could come unstuck.  
2. Monthly Mentality. ItÕs great to receive a regular wage. It isnÕt so great when your wages arrive and the entire sum is already spoken for. Unfortunately, this seems to be increasingly common, with families taking on a bewildering array of monthly commitments.With fixed costs consuming so much of peopleÕs wages, it is hard to find money to save. Second, things could quickly turn ugly if people are laid off or get hit with hefty home-repair costs. Sure, if necessary, they could ditch some of their monthly obligations. But once people get used to a certain standard of living, it is painful to cut back.    3. Debtors?Prison. Suppose you own a $250,000 house and you have $200,000 stashed in stocks and bonds. But you also have a $200,000 mortgage and $30,000 in car loans and credit-card debt. Add it up, and you have $450,000 in total assets and $230,000 in total debts, giving you a net worth of $220,000. Normally this wouldnÕt seem very risky.    But imagine you lost your job during a weak housing market. After some scrambling, you find a new job, but it is on the other side of the country. This means you have to sell your current home, relocate your family and buy another home, while continuing to cover living expenses and service debts. With any luck, thanks to your new job, you wonÕt have any problem qualifying for another mortgage. But you still have to find a deposit for the new house.    DonÕt be dissuaded from ever taking on debt. But bad things happen, so you need to give yourself some financial breathing room. This means limiting your debts, holding down monthly financial obligations and having some savings in a regular account.    But most of all, you need to think ahead. You need to build unlikely possibilities into your financial plan before something goes wrong and itÕs too late for planning.  ",0,,,0.0,0
1066,Converting a 401(k) into a Roth IRA  ,"Q. I am 74 and would like to convert all or part of my 401(k) to a Roth IRA. How is that done?  

A.  
It's a two-step process. First, the 401(k) would be rolled over into a traditional IRA. Then that IRA would be converted to a Roth.    Any brokerage or mutual fund company can provide the forms for rolling the 401(k) into an IRA and then converting the IRA to a Roth. So long as the money is moved directly from the 401(k) to the IRA — without stopping in an ordinary bank account along the way, for instance — there won't be any tax charged, as 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are treated the same for tax purposes.    For the Roth, all the money you convert will be subject to income tax. That's the tax normally paid on withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs. It is charged on conversions because once your money is in a Roth, both the original sum and future investment gains will be tax-free.    There are a number of things to consider:    Shifting from a 401(k) to a traditional IRA can make sense even if you don't take the next step to the Roth, as IRAs offer more investment choices.    Roth investors are never required to make withdrawals, while investors with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs have to begin minimum annual withdrawals after turning 70½. This is important if you want the money to compound longer, or if you'd like to leave the account to heirs, who would get a Roth free of any income tax. (A Roth can be subject to estate tax if your estate is larger than $2 million.)    If you switched to a Roth, you'd have to leave your money to grow in the account for some time to make the move pay. The benefit comes from the tax-free growth that starts once the money is in the Roth.    Generally, a Roth conversion makes sense if you expect your income tax rate to be higher in the future, since paying tax on today's conversion saves you the higher tax you'd have made later on the 401(k) or traditional IRA.    To be sure of benefiting from a Roth conversion, all of the money originally in the 401(k) should go into the Roth. In other words, don't take money from the 401(k) to pay the tax due on conversion. The tax should be paid from other funds.    Since you are in your mid-70s, the clearest benefit of moving from a 401(k) to a Roth is the ability to pass future investment gains to heirs tax-free.    But even that benefit is not certain if you are in a high tax bracket and your heirs are in a low one. The net sum left to your heirs might be higher if they paid a small tax on a 401(k) rather than having you pay a large tax on a conversion.    Try playing with a Roth-conversion calculator, such as the one at  www.calctools  .com/RothConversion.htm.    Q.    My 21-year-old son has repeatedly been denied a credit card because he does not have a credit history. What should he do?    A.    The simplest solution is for your son to get a secured credit card. Unlike the common unsecured card, the secured card requires the holder to deposit money with the issuer before using the card — typically $300 to $500, but sometimes less. The cardholder then has a credit limit equal to the amount on deposit.    After making on-time card payments for a year, he should be able to get a regular credit card.    Search for secured cards at  www.bankrate.com , and watch out for high fees.    Contact Jeff Brown at brownj@phillynews.com.  ",1,,,0.0,0
1067,Temporary relief on high water bills on way; Residents say spike isn't warranted,"SAN DIEGO

Council President Pro Tem Barbara Bry has called for temporary relief for San Diegans who continue to say the city has charged them for water they didn't use.
Customers fighting high bills should continue to have access to water as long as they pay an amount equal to their average usage or what they were charged in the previous year during the same time period.  In the last two months, Bry said her office has been flooded with calls from frustrated ratepayers.  ""We are hearing from San Diego residents who have complained about inexplicably high water bills and are now at risk of losing service if they do not pay their bills within the normal billing timeline,"" Bry wrote in a press statement Tuesday. ""We must ensure that San Diegans retain access to water during this investigation.""  The grace period should last until a recently announced internal audit of the Public Utilities Department is completed this June.  City Auditor Eduardo Luna said that he will prioritize the issue and will update the public as the investigation unfolds.  The water department has already implemented similar guidelines, said spokesman Jerry McCormick. ""We don't automatically shut off people's water. We always try to work with them.""  San Diegans all over the city have expressed concern about unusually high water bills - surging from hundreds to sometimes thousands of dollars.  Officials with the water department have said that often the increase in water use is due to leaky pipes and toilet or overwatering.  However, before paying for a plumber, residents should check the reading on their meters against any unusually high bill. In a number of cases, outrageous charges have been traced by to meter reads.  Customers wishing to contest a bill should call the water department (619) 515-3500 or email at water@sandiego.gov.  In a number of instances, smart meters - known as Advanced Metering Infrastructure, or AMI - have been used by the department to pinpoint usage by date and time of day, locating sources of increased water consumption, officials said.  The city has installed close to 90,000 smart meters, with a full roll-out of the program expected by 2020. Only about 15,000 such meters are currently being read remotely.  The water department makes several thousand bill adjustments a month for a wide variety of reasons, according to a 2013 audit of the department. The department issues roughly 1.8 million bills a year to about 285,000 customers.  joshua.smith@sduniontribune.com (619) 293-2234 Twitter: @jemersmith",0,,,0.0,0
1075,£100 SPEEDING FINES — FROM YOUR INSURER; AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY CATCH TO NEW 'BLACK BOX' CAR COVER THAT'S MEANT TO BE CHEAPER,"DRIVERS who sign up for black box car cover can be hit with a £100 fine from their insurer if they speed, a Money Mail investigation has found.

Black box technology, which monitors the safety of your driving, is supposed to be the new way to get discounts on your insurance.
Drivers are told they will be rewarded with lower premiums if they have good habits.  But people are discovering that reductions are impossible to get and are being eroded by other fees. Sell your car, switch policy or breach the smallprint, and you could be hit with hefty penalties.  With most insurers you'll receive warnings if you break rules such as regularly driving at 40mph in a 30mph zone. If you ignore these alerts and carry on driving poorly, the insurer can fine you on a case-by-case basis.  In some instances, Money Mail understands, the fines can be as much as £100. In the worst cases it will cancel your policy.  iKube charges £100 a night if you drive outside of its curfew hours of 11pm to 5am.  Admiral, which provides cover through its Bell subsidiary, also only knocks more money off if you can drive more safely than rival policyholders. But this can make it difficult to grab a discount because many black box customers already tend to drive more cautiously.  Mike Powell, insurance analyst at research company Defaqto, says: 'Black box insurance carries so many fees and charges, they need to be made much, much clearer.  'It's very easy for drivers to be taken in by the technology, along with the promised drop in premiums, but they can end up paying out a lot more than they thought.'  Young, newly qualified motorists are increasingly faced with quotes of £2,500 or more for standard insurance. Black box cover is sold as the way to cut their costs.  It works a bit like the black box flight recorders in planes. A device about the size of a mobile phone is attached to your dashboard or under the steering wheel. A computer then uses satellite signals to monitor your driving. This includes how you brake and accelerate, speed, distance covered, time of day — even road position.  There are about a dozen companies offering black box cover. Four years ago, only 12,000 people had a policy, now the figure has soared to 290,000. Insurers claim that if you can prove yourself to be a low-risk driver the policies will reduce the cost of your cover. Research from comparison website Moneysupermarket suggests good motorists who used black box technology — also known as telematics — could have £212 knocked off their insurance.  But their premiums would start at £1,280 a year. This reflects the fact that nearly half of all policyholders are between 17 and 19 years old.  According to the Association of British Insurers, 18-year-old drivers are three times more likely to be involved in an accident than a 48-year-old. Young female drivers used to benefit from reduced premiums because they are so much less likely to have a serious accident. Today, insurers are barred from basing tariffs on sex, so black box technology is thought to be particularly attractive to women as a way of reducing costs.  But what many are discovering is that black box policies come with expensive traps to snag the unwary. They start from the day you sign up. All insurers hit you with fines of between £30 to £100 if you miss your appointment to have the box fitted. If you don't have the right documents to get it done — a driving licence, MoT and proof of ownership — there's another £30-£45 penalty.  If you buy a new car during the year, you'll have to pay to have your black box reinstalled. The Co-op charges £90, while the AA levies £120.  Shop around for a cheaper black box policy after a year, and you'll usually have to pay again. David Neave, director of black box software provider Wunelli, says: 'It's something insurers are working on — it's not ideal at all, but it will change.'  If you go back to ordinary car cover, then you'll pay up to £120 to have the box removed.  Although many policies carry clear fines, insurers also look at individual instances of bad driving. This is where fines for repeated poor behaviour can be levied.  Critically, you may not even be rewarded if you do drive well. Buried in Admiral's terms for Bell's policies, it says: 'We compare your driving with that of other customers and calculate a score based on how you drive — and how your driving compares to other customers. At renewal, we will use this score and performance group to determine if your renewal price should be discounted or increased.'  An Admiral spokesman says: 'Drivers' scores are compared against other driver scores and the best scores result in a higher discount.'  Not all policies reward a rapid improvement in driving. While some review your habits every month — and update how much you have to pay — others only do it once a year.  Graeme Trudgill, of the British Insurance Brokers' Association, says: 'Black box is still relatively new so many insurers are still exploring the options.  'Some insurers are waiting to see if it is simply only those drivers predisposed to driving cautiously anyway that will use it or if it will significantly change those less cautious drivers' behaviour too.'  s.dunn@dailymail.co.uk  © Daily Mail",0,,,0.0,0
1078,"Balancing retirement savings, paying for college","Most people want to help their children pay for a quality college education, but it can be difficult to balance personal financial goals and funding your kids' educational aspirations. When retirement savings is sacrificed for college costs, it can be a disservice to the entire family.

To help guide you in determining the best way to pay for your kids' college while still funding your retirement savings, personal finance expert and host of the So Money podcast Farnoosh Torabi offers several smart tips.
Don't put retirement on the back burner.  While funding your children's college education is important, your retirement savings should take priority. Strive to contribute 10 to 15 percent of your take-home pay toward retirement savings. The reality is college is four years and retirement can be 30+ years. Plus, there's no scholarship for retirement like there is for college!  Take the free money.  If your workplace retirement plan comes with a match, take it. Contribute the minimum to receive your employer match. At the end of the day, it's free money and that's the best kind.  Involve your children in the college cost discussion.  College is expensive, so make sure you're discussing with your kids overall costs and what you're willing to contribute. Have them help research financial aid and scholarship opportunities, too. Remember, you want to find a school that's the best fit - so don't let the initial ""sticker price"" scare your children from applying. Some private colleges may give the best aid packages, but other times they may not. Don't make assumptions and always keep your options open. The goal is to find the college with the best value.  Don't take on more than you can afford.  While involving your children in the discussion, it's also important to make sure you're not setting them up for failure when they graduate. As they research student loan possibilities, make sure they'll be able to comfortably afford payments once they graduate, and that they're not taking on too much debt.  An easy way to start researching together is to visit College Ave Student Loans and use the configure-it-out tool. Answer a short series of questions regarding how much you'll borrow, how many years of schooling are left, whether you want to make payments during school or not, etc. This shows your child what repayment will look like under each option so you can both be clear on the details and agree on a game plan.  Consider the college savings plan that's best for you.  Consider opening a 529 that allows flexible spending toward higher education. Should your child choose to forgo traditional college education or not require the funds set aside, you can easily change the beneficiary to another child or relative.  If you're skeptical of a 529, consider a Roth IRA if your income limits allow. Although typically used for retirement, the Roth IRA has an exception where you can withdraw your contributions from the account at any time tax- and penalty-free for qualified education expenses. The remaining money can be collected in your retirement.  Starting late? Play catch-up.  If saving for retirement has not been a priority, it's time to get aggressive. Pare down costs where possible and take advantage of catch-up contributions. People who are 50 or older can contribute an extra $6,000 to their 401(k) or an extra $1,000 to an IRA this tax year.  Don't become the ""bank of Mom and Dad.""  You want to help your kids, but once you set the precedent that it's OK for your children to ask for money (or a contribution toward college), they may feel they can frequently approach you later in life for funds. Don't set the tone that you'll always be there to financially support them. You want them to grow wings so they can fly independently (and so you can happily enter retirement and enjoy those golden years).  While you should talk with your child about potential majors and career paths, it's important also to add financial conversations into the mix.

1087,The Law of Unintended Consequences: The Case of Proxy Advisory Firms,"The SEC requires all institutional investors to vote on all matters put forth in proxy statements, or the measures voted on during shareholder meetings. For most institutional investors, keeping up with all of these issues is not feasible, so they turn to proxy advisory firms.

Proxy advisory firms help institutional investors wade through the overwhelming numbers of measures, and two proxy advisory firms, ISS (an arm of Genstar, a private equity firm) and Glass Lewis (an arm of the Ontario Teacher’s Pension Plan Board and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation) control 97 percent of the proxy advisory market.
The rule was supposed to protect shareholders’ interests but, as the SEC roundtable scheduled for today recognizes, the growing clout of proxy advisory firms has raised concerns that unintended, and adverse, consequences have resulted. The advice proxy advisory firms provide regarding environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) programs exemplifies the problems. The goal of ESG programs is to explicitly account for issues that some people believe are important and want to promote, which sometimes comes at the expense of financial returns.  Both ISS and Glass Lewis sponsor ESG programs; consequently, the firms have a preordained belief that pro-ESG proxy statements should be supported. Thus, their advice has clear bias on ESG issues that is not adequately disclosed. ESG criteria also raises fiduciary responsibility questions for institutional investors that the proxy advisory firms fail to fully appreciate.  From the perspective of the individual investor, voting in favor of specific ESG programs can make sense. Perhaps the ESG program will enhance profits, perhaps it won’t. Either way, individual investors know the constraints they are imposing, and bear the consequences from their actions.  This nexus does not hold for institutional investors, particularly public pension funds because pensioners typically have no other investment options – if you are a teacher in California, CalSTRS will manage your pension, you have no choice. Since public pension funds represent many individuals, it is inevitable that ESG policies and investing preferences will clash. For example, there is a growing push for CalPERS to divest from fossil fuel companies even though 67 percent of members surveyed by Spectrem Group in 2018 stated that the sector “is an essential element of a balanced, diversified portfolio”.  Further, many studies that have examined ESG (see here or here) have found that automatically screening out investment options, or imposing uneconomic constraints, harms financial results. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce expressed these concerns at the 2018 Annual SEC Conference stating that: “the problems arise when those making the investment decisions are doing so on behalf of others who do not share their ESG objectives.…When a pension fund manager is making the decision to pursue her moral goals at the risk of financial return, the manager is putting other people’s retirements at risk.”  The large unfunded liabilities of public sector pension funds worsen these costs.  Take California as an example. As newly-elected CalPERS Board member Jason Perez estimated, the CalPERS ESG program toward tobacco cost the retirement fund $8 billion, which is sizable relative to California’s current unfunded liabilities of nearly $170 billion according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. The problem may even be worse than that. As I recently reported in my chart-book on California’s pension crisis, total public employee pension debt is really closer to $1 trillion using a more realistic market estimate.  The large fiscal hole leaves Californians with few good choices. If the state raises taxes, it would reduce overall economic prosperity, but if it fails to fully fund their pension obligations, then future public sector retirees will suffer greater economic insecurity. Given these difficult trade-offs, any policy that limits the public pension systems’ investment options, and costs potential returns, worsens California’s pension crisis.  Combining the potential investment losses with the diversity of opinions regarding contentious social issues, it is clear that ESG investing is inappropriate for public pension funds. However, it is unclear that either ISS or Glass Lewis account for the specific needs of public pension funds when advising institutional investors about ESG proxy statements. In fact, based on their own ESG programs, it is reasonable to conclude that both firms are biased toward supporting such programs despite the clear negative impact these policies have on public pension funds.  Without reforms that better align the interests of the proxy advisory firms and the interests of fund shareholders, these unnecessary costs will persist. To address the problems, several reforms are necessary.  For example, instead of assuming that the analyses of proxy advisory firms are objective, or allowing the proxy advisory firms to rely on their “general conflict of interest” statements, the SEC should require conflict of interest disclosures that are specific to the issue under evaluation. More relevant conflict of interest disclosures will help ensure that the investors relying on the proxy firms’ recommendations are aware of the proxy firm’s specific biases and potential conflicts of interest as it relates to the specific issue under consideration.  The SEC should also consider eliminating the requirement that institutional investors vote on all items on corporate proxy statements. Enabling institutional investors to focus on only those corporate proxy statements they deem material would reduce the artificial demand for the proxy advisory services, and therefore improve the competitive environment.  Without such reforms, while unintentional, the current proxy process will continue to create additional, and unnecessary, risks for investors.",0,,,0.0,0

With unemployment at levels unseen for decades and the bearish stock market giving back all of its 2019 gains, financial professionals say it's a time for people to stay focused on long-term goals, take advantage of changes in the tax laws, keep good records, and be prepared to pay income taxes on the unemployment checks you've received.
""Now's the time to be conserving cash,"" said Michael Turturro, managing partner of RBT CPAs, of Poughkeepsie and Newburgh. ""Spend only where you need to spend. Consider consolidating your debt, and getting rid of high-interest credit cards. We don't know what it's going to look like months from now.""  The economic downturn has proved unsettling for those saving for retirement, with their 401(k) nest-eggs shrunk by the sell-off on Wall Street. Jerry Terwilleger, a financial advisor with Edward Jones in New Windsor said it's important to keep your eye on your long-term goals and not overreact to the wild swings in the volatile market in the spring of 2020.  ""You need to try to avoid making emotional decisions, which I know can be difficult,"" he said. ""But you don't want to be swayed by short-term headlines. You don't want them to influence your long-term decisions.""  The COVID-19 pandemic hit here in mid-March, up just as the April 15 deadline neared for federal and state income tax filings. Those deadlines were pushed back to July 15, So were first-quarter tax payments for some businesses and individuals were required to make.  However, the deadline for the second quarter – June 15 – was not changed, leaving second-quarter payments due before the first-quarter payments, said Rob Winton, a partner with Citrin Cooperman in White Plains.  Tapping your 401(k)  Changes in federal tax law, passed by Congress in response to the pandemic, could help households pressed for cash in 2020. In the past, it was costly to make a withdrawal from your tax-deferred retirement account if you did so before you were age 591/2, with a penalty of 10% assessed on the withdrawal. The new law allows those who suffered hardships from the pandemic to make withdrawals of up to $100,000, without the 10% penalty, said Rob Winton, a partner at Citrin Cooperman in White Plains.  You don't have to pay taxes on the withdrawal if you pay it back to your 401(k) account within three years.  But until the three years is up, you are required to pay taxes on the income – either all of it in the first year, or at least one-third of the taxes each year. If you repay the withdrawal to your 401(k) by the third year, then you would have to amend your filings for 2020 and 2021 to receive a refund on what you had paid.  ""It's not the easiest thing to do,"" Winton said. ""It's not a straight-forward as it appeared.""  Taxes on government checks  How federal and state financial aid to individuals in the COVID-19 era is taxed depends on which program provided the funding. The federal stimulus checks were tax-free because they were structured as federal tax credits.  But unemployment payments from New York state are taxable, said James DeMinno, founder and president of the DeMinno CPA Firm in New City.  ""It's always taxable,"" said DeMinno. ""But you have to put food on the table. You need to feed the kids.""  PPP deadlines  DeMinno said several of his clients obtained loans under the federal Payroll Protection Program, which came with the provision that the loan would be forgiven if the employer used at least 75% of the loan proceeds to pay workers during an eight-week period. He said it's important for employers to keep track of payroll spending, with payments made with checks.  Those businesses that took loans, such as restaurants, which have remained closed, are in a bind because their established has yet to reopen, and employees have not been called back to work. He said there's discussion in Washington about extending the period in which spending on payroll expenses can take place.  ""I have a couple of clients with loans of over $1 million who are still closed,"" he said. ""The clock is ticking. They are hoping for an extension. We are keeping our fingers crossed.""

1098,Oak Bay police officer's bid to work past 60 denied twice,"The Oak Bay Police Board has twice rejected an officer's desire to work past the age of 60.

The police board denied the officer's request to work beyond age 60 because of a contractual mandatory age of retirement.
After the officer filed a grievance, the Oak Bay police union took the issue back to the department, which again put it before the police board.  For a second time, the board, which acts as the employer, denied the officer's request.  ""The board's position on retirement at age 60 is in keeping with the negotiated terms of the collective agreement,"" Oak Bay Mayor Nils Jensen, a board member, said in an email.  Oak Bay Police Chief Andrew Brinton said he can't speak to specifics because of privacy concerns, but confirmed a personnel matter related to retirement as set out in the collective agreement was discussed by the police board at in-camera meetings April through June.  The mandatory age of retirement was upheld by the department and board, said Brinton.  There have been no retirements at the department since last summer, he said.  ""The board simply felt it is part of the collective agreement and it would be inappropriate to step away form it,"" said Brinton.  He said the board's decision was based in part on a B.C. Human Rights Tribunal decision last year related to a Vancouver firefighter who claimed age discrimination.  ""That's confirmed in the minds of many there is a contractual arrangement that all parties have agreed to going into their employment,"" said Brinton.  On June 26, the Human Rights Tribunal dismissed an age discrimination complaint by John Yaremy, a firefighter employed by the City of Vancouver and a member of the Vancouver Fire Fighters' Union, Local 18.  Yaremy lost his job when he turned 60. The collective agreement between the City of Vancouver and the union requires all firefighters regardless of classification, gender, or department of service to retire at age 60.  The city and union said that the actuarially based supplemental pension system that confirmed the early retirement of firefighters at age 60 dates to arrangements dating to the early 1900s.  Stephanie Gutierrez, a labour and human rights lawyer in Vancouver, said there have been challenges of the retirement at 60 requirement, but they have been unsuccessful. ""Essentially under our human rights legislation, which is not too dissimilar from human rights legislation across the country, we have a provision that a person must not discriminate in employment on various grounds including age, except that prohibition does not apply with age and other grounds for the operation of bona fide retirement, superannuation or pension plan or bona fide employee insurance plan,"" Gutierrez said.  B.C. Police Association president Tom Stamatakis said most police officers with 25 to 30 years on the job are ready to retire. ""Most retire before age 60,"" said Stamatakis. ""Most benefits and pension plans are structured around age 60.""  Stamatakis points to the increased costs to benefits and pension plan premiums that come with people working longer and the physical toll that the job itself and shift work takes. ""You are allowed to discriminate based on age where there is a bona fide employment requirement - for a firefighter, paramedic and police officer,"" said Stamatakis.  He said firefighters have challenged the collective agreement but he's not aware of police officers doing so.  In Victoria, at least one officer wanted to work beyond age 60 and an exception was made. Victoria police spokesman Const. Matt Rutherford said the retirement age for Victoria police officers is subject to their collective agreement, arrived at through negotiations between the Victoria Police Department and the Victoria police union. That negotiated retirement age is 60.  However, ""the department and the police union may agree on exceptions from time to time,"" said Rutherford.  ""There are many factors that are considered during these types of discussions,"" said Rutherford. ""At present, the department has one officer over the age of 60."" Details are confidential, said Rutherford.  Brinton said he couldn't talk about what other departments do around the issue of mandatory age retirements. ""That's up to each police board how they want to manage it,"" said Brinton. ""In the case of Oak Bay all I can say is they chose to stay in line with the collective agreement and there have been recent decisions in the province to support that.""  ceharnett@timescolonist.com( mailto:ceharnett@timescolonist.com )",0,,,1.0,1
1100,FINANCIAL FOCUS; How does Social Security fit into your retirement income strategy?,"It might not be on your calendar, but Aug. 14 is Social Security Day. Since it was enacted on Aug. 14, 1935, Social Security has provided some financial support for millions of Americans during their retirement years. While Social Security benefits, by themselves, probably aren't enough to enable you to retire comfortably, they can be a key part of your overall retirement income strategy - if you use them wisely.

To help you make decisions about Social Security, you will need to answer these questions:
When should I start taking my benefits? You can take Social Security once you reach 62, but if you wait until your full retirement age, which will probably be between 66 and 67, you'll get much bigger monthly checks, and if you wait until 70, you'll get the biggest possible payments. Before deciding when to begin receiving your benefits, you'll need to weigh a few factors, including your estimated longevity and your other sources of income.  How should I consider potential spousal benefits? If you are married, or if you're divorced but were married for at least 10 years, you could receive up to half of your spouse's full retirement benefit (offset by your own benefit, and reduced if you claim early). If you outlive your spouse, you could claim survivor benefits, which can provide either your own benefits or 100% of your deceased spouse's, whichever is larger. Consequently, the higher-earning spouse might want to postpone taking benefits for as long as possible to maximize the survivor benefit.  How much can I earn without reducing my Social Security benefits? If you are younger than your full retirement age and you are receiving Social Security, the Social Security Administration will withhold $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn over a certain threshold (which, in 2019, is $17,640). For the year you reach your full retirement age, your benefits could be withheld by $1 for every $3 you earn over $46,920. But once you reach your full retirement age, you can earn as much as you want without your benefits being withheld, although your benefits could still be taxed, depending on your income.  How much of my pre-retirement income will Social Security replace? Generally speaking, you should expect Social Security to replace slightly more than a third of your pre-retirement income. However, the higher your income during your working years, the lower the replacement value of Social Security will be.  What other sources of retirement income should I develop?Contribute as much as you can afford to your IRA and your 401(k) or similar employer-sponsored retirement plan. You may want to consult with a financial professional, who can look at your entire retirement income picture and recommend moves to help you achieve the lifestyle you've envisioned for your later years.  Keep in mind that your decisions about Social Security filing strategies should always be based on your specific needs and health considerations. For more information, visit the Social Security Administration website at socialsecurity.gov.  One final word: You may have concerns about the stability of Social Security. While no one can predict the future, many potential solutions exist to put the program on more solid footing. Consequently, try to focus on the actions you can control.

1103,Troubleshooter,"Pension problems

I am approaching 60 and have a pension pot of about £125,000 in a defined contribution scheme from my time with an organisation called Home Group. The scheme is administered by Friends Life.
I was told by Friends Life in June last year that, as a result of the government's pensions reforms, from this April I would be able to take all of the pot out as cash without having to buy an annuity. But on two subsequent occasions, the most recent this month, I was told that it cannot confirm this as ""we are waiting for details from the government"" and that I ""should phone back in March when we hope things will be clearer"".  Given that these reforms are supposed to take effect in less than three months' time, I find it frustrating that I cannot obtain any definitive answers on which to base critical financial decisions.  LEN DAVIES, VIA EMAIL  From April, anyone aged over 55 should be able to do what they like with their pension pot. But the ""freedom and choice"" pension reforms could leave 5.9 million people at risk of poor decisions, the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) warned this week. ""There is very little time until freedoms start but there's still a great deal of uncertainty about what people should do to make best use of the new pension reforms,"" says Graham Vidler, of the NAPF. It doesn't help if people such as Len can't get basic answers to their questions from their pension provider.  Another reader, Paul Harrison from Nottingham, says he phoned Scottish Widows in January to inquire about taking advantage of the new pension rules. He says: ""I was amazed to be told that Scottish Widows had no systems or procedure to register my inquiry. I then said I would like to draw down my pension over a period of time to avoid 40 per cent tax but Scottish Widows stated I would have to draw the whole pension or leave it where it is.""  Both Friends Life and Scottish Widows were apologetic but argued that they have systems in place. A spokesman for Friends Life says: ""We are sorry to hear that Mr Davies did not receive the support he required. We are now arranging for a retirement specialist to call him to discuss his questions. We have a dedicated team of people who can provide customers with information and answer questions about the new options available to people approaching retirement. However, we are unable to action an instruction from a customer wanting to take advantage of the pension freedoms until they come into force on April 6. We also suggest customers seek independent financial advice in order to make informed decisions about their retirement income needs.""  A Scottish Widows spokesman says: ""We are very sorry that the incorrect information was provided to Mr Harrison and have contacted him to ensure his request is dealt with properly. Scottish Widows can take instructions now which will be processed as soon as the legislation becomes effective. We have also been contacting customers nearing retirement since October last year to help make sure they understand the changes.""  Elderly targets  My 98-year-old mother, who has dementia, was not using her landline phone so I removed it from her in July 2014. The bill from her provider, TalkTalk, was then £26.59, so I rang up to pay this and terminate the contract but got nowhere. I wrote a letter on July 10 asking to cancel Mother's phone line and stressing that I would not be paying anything above the amount due. Since then I have written four more times, the last being on November 27. There has not been a meaningful response to any of my letters. TalkTalk even asked her for her password, which is a Joke as she cannot possibly remember it.  Meanwhile Mother's account continues to accrue charges — it is now at £162.39.  PAUL TILZEY, NORTH CORNWALL  On this page we today report the story of an 81-year-old woman with dementia who had hundreds of pounds stolen via a cold call on her landline phone. Courier fraud is a crime so despicable that perpetrators who are caught by the police beg to have the fact that they fleeced elderly people kept a secret from other jailed prisoners, reports the Hampstead & Highgate Express newspaper in London.  Landline companies can help to prevent crime against those with dementia. Ofcom has encouraged telephone providers to cut the time a phone line remains open after someone hangs up to just a couple of seconds. This stops fraudsters staying on the line to impersonate a victim's bank or the police, the key to making a caller sound convincing. It would also help if phone companies terminated contracts promptly when the children of those with dementia ask them to. TalkTalk says it made a mistake in failing to act on Paul's request and has apologised, waived the charges and deactivated his mother's phone line.",1,,,0.0,0
1112,"Mum had drugs, utensils in family home","A NEWTOWN mother of three has taken a hit to the household budget by way of a hefty fine after she was found with cannabis, smoking utensils and a syringe during a police search.

Rebecca Ellen Beazley had become agitated when police arrived at her Newtown home with a search warrant on June 11, Toowoomba Magistrates Court heard.
When it appeared she was about to move something in the kitchen, a policeman stood in her path and she had taken a swing at him, which missed, police prosecutor Bettina Trenear told the court.  The police search turned up a total 17.4g of cannabis found in various clip seal bags and a bowl in the kitchen and lounge room, a homemade bong and two other pipes for smoking the drug, and scissors and an electric grinder used for chopping up cannabis leaf, the court heard.  Ms Trenear said police also found a used syringe inside a wallet carrying Beazley’s identification under a lounge chair.  The 33-year-old told police she had found the syringe while cleaning up and put it in the wallet for safe keeping, she said.  Beazley pleaded guilty to four offences including failing to take reasonable care and precaution in respect of a syringe or needle, possessing a dangerous drug, possessing drug utensils and possessing property suspected of having been used in connection with a drug offence.  Duty solicitor Phil Stainton, of Queensland Legal Aid’s Toowoomba office, told the court his client had since re-engaged with Lives Lived Well and was receiving counselling.  Mr Stainton submitted a fine as penalty.Magistrate Howard Osborne convicted and fined Beazley $750 and ordered all drug and related items found be forfeited to the Crown for destruction.",1,,,0.0,0
1121,Tax-deferred accounts get (temporary) boost from CARES Act,"You need to primarily rely on yourself to protect your health during the coronavirus. But from a financial standpoint, you may have gotten some relief – or at least some flexibility from the recently passed $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Retirement account holders, including owners of IRAs and 401(k)s are usually required to start taking distributions from these accounts once they reach age 72. The CARES Act waives these required minimum distributions (RMDs) for all employer plans and IRAs in 2020, with the exception of defined benefit plans. If you've already taken your distribution for 2020, you can put the funds back in your retirement account if you meet certain requirements.
Of course, if you needed – or will need – the money from the RMD for your cash flow needs, you won't have to return it. But if you don't really need the money, avoiding an RMD in 2020 or returning an RMD to your retirement account will give the funds more time to grow on a tax-deferred basis before the RMDs are once again required in 2021.  Another CARES Act provision allows for the 10% early withdrawal penalty to be waived for withdrawals up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k)s, for individuals who qualify for COVID-19 relief. Qualifying individuals include those who are diagnosed with COVID-19, have a spouse or dependent who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or experience adverse financial consequences as a result of COVID-19, including quarantines, layoffs, business closures or child care responsibilities. Income tax on the distribution would still be owed but could be paid over a three-year period. Employer plan participants also may increase the amount that can be taken as a loan from a qualified retirement plan from $50,000 to $100,000 for 2020. While the CARES Act allows these penalty-free withdrawals and increased plan loan amounts, you will need to contact your plan administrator to determine whether these options are available in your plan.  Even though you may be able to access these funds penalty-free, it doesn't necessarily mean you should do so. Try to exhaust some of the other provisions in the CARES Act first, such as the mortgage or student loan relief, or using the direct payment to bridge the gap on current expenses before taking a distribution or loan from your retirement account. If you decide to take a withdrawal or loan, work with your financial advisor to consider developing strategies to contribute/pay back these funds over time to reduce any long-term impact to your retirement goals.  Please consult with your tax professional before making any CARES Act-related moves with your retirement accounts. Partnering with your tax and financial professionals can help in the decision-making process. In the meantime, stay safe, stay healthy and keep looking forward to brighter days ahead.

1125,Universal Credit shake-up will affect 500 people from Monday -what you need to know,"Old-style legacy benefits are being phased out, with the “migration” process of switching people over to Universal Credit restarting on Monday, May 9. Only around 500 people will be invited to move over at first

The so-called “migration” process of moving legacy benefit claimants to Universal Credit will restart next week, in a move that will ultimately affect millions of Brits.
There are around 2.6million people still claiming old-style benefits in the UK.  This includes tax credits, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance JSA, Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance ESA and Housing Benefit.  These benefits are eventually being phased out, with the “migration” process of switching people over to Universal Credit restarting on Monday, May 9.  This process had been temporarily paused during the Covid pandemic.  Only around 500 people will be invited to move over at first, but the Department for Work and Pensions DWP will increase the numbers of people it processes over the next few months.  Everyone will eventually be moved from the older welfare system to Universal Credit by December 2024.  Anyone who applies for new benefits right now gets Universal Credit automatically.  When it is your turn to be moved over to the new system, you will receive a “migration notice” in the post which will give you a three-month deadline to claim Universal Credit.  Have you been told you are moving to Universal Credit Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  If you don't start a claim for Universal Credit within this time, your current benefits will automatically stop after this deadline.  Some people may be moved across to Universal Credit early if they see a change in circumstances -for example, if they move home or change their working hours.  As we've mentioned above, everyone will be migrated over eventually -but you can also choose to transfer over sooner if you think you'd be better off.  Not everyone will get more money on Universal Credit. The DWP claims 1.4million legacy claimants 55% are set to be better off under the new system, and 900,000 35% would be worse off.  The other 300,000 benefit claimants will see no change.  We've got a guide here on how to check if you'll be better off on Universal Credit.  Once you make a Universal Credit claim, your old benefits will be stopped -you will then have to wait five weeks for your first Universal Credit payment to arrive.  Some legacy benefits will ""run on"" for two weeks to help bridge some of that gap.  This includes Housing Benefit, Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance and income-based Jobseeker's Allowance.  With both types of tax credits, payments will stop as soon as you claim Universal Credit.  Which benefits are being replaced  Universal Credit is replacing the following six benefits:  * Working Tax Credit  * Child Tax Credit  * income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance JSA  * Income Support  * income-related Employment and Support Allowance ESA  * Housing Benefit  Most of those being moved over to Universal Credit are on ESA 1.2million or Tax Credits 1million.  200,000 are on Income Support and 100,000 on each of Housing Benefit and JSA.",1,,,0.0,1
1135,PersonalFinance: Making sense of the housing market,"(Linda Stern is a freelance writer. Any opinions in the column are hers. You can follow Linda Stern's financial notes on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/lindastern)

By Linda Stern
WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters Life!) - Buying or selling a home might be the biggest single financial transaction of your life. You want to get it right but how do you do that at a time when even professionals don't fully understand what's going on in the housing market?  Is it a good time to buy a home or sell a home? Here are some thoughts about how to approach the housing market now.  -- Don't rush. Probably the one housing market observation that everyone agrees on is this: It's not going to take off in a hurry. Analysts expect it to be several years before home prices return to the levels they reached in 2005-2007. And they don't expect mortgage rates to skyrocket, either.  -- Research your own market. Some areas still seem to be in free fall, with high foreclosures and no real recovery in sight. Other areas that weren't so bubbly in the first place have been doing all right. Check with local real estate agents and Websites like trulia.com, (http://www.trulia.com) homegain.com (http://www.homegain.com) or the Standard & Poor's Case Shiller index (http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-case-shiller-home-price-indices/en/us/?indexId=SPUSA-CASHPIDFF--P-US----) to see what's actually happening in your chosen neighborhood.  -- Expect prices to fall further. There's a disconnect between what sellers think their homes are worth and what buyers are willing to pay, according to a new survey from HomeGain. Some 79 percent of homeowners believe their homes are worth more than the recommended agent listing price, and 69 percent of agents and brokers think homes are overpriced. If owners really want to sell their home, they'll drop the price to a level that will attract offers; it's rarely worth carrying a home for months or years while you wait for the price to get to your desired level. That means that homebuyers may find some better deals ahead.  -- Look for a retirement or vacation home now. If you've been thinking you'd like a second home now or a future home in the traditional retirement Sunbelt, go shopping. You'll be able to get a good deal. But beware: You may lack neighbors for years to come. That doesn't just mean you'll be lonely; it means you could be paying out-sized condo and clubhouse fees to compensate.  -- Plan a seasonal approach. If you need to sell now, price your house low enough to engage a buyer before snow falls. In cold-weather areas, winter is often a long and lackluster time for real estate. If you're buying, start looking now, but expect that by winter you may get even more for your money.  -- Keep it about your own budget. If you want to buy a home and can afford the payments, don't worry so much about the macro-economic forecast for housing.  -- Keep maintenance in mind. The recession has dampened the market for contractors and for energy commodities. Once the economic recovery strengthens, you can expect to pay a lot more for any repair work your home requires, and for your heating and cooling bills going forward. Look for the lot and the house that will fit your family, but keep an eye on those practical considerations, too.  (Editing by Gunna Dickson and Patricia Reaney)",1,,,0.0,0
1138,"Obama, Romney seek to stop doubling of student loan interest rate","WASHINGTON (AP) - President Barack Obama and his likely GOP opponent, Mitt Romney, agree on an issue of importance to college students: Keeping the interest rate low on a popular federally subsidized student loan issued to low-and middle-income students.

The interest rate is scheduled to double on July 1 from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent on subsidized Stafford loans unless Congress acts. About 7 million undergraduates would be affected, raising costs by an average of $1,000 each, according to the White House.
Obama embarked on Tuesday on a tour through college campuses in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa to discuss the rate increase. Before he left, however, Romney stole a little wind from his sails by saying he, too, agreed with the need to stop the rate from doubling.  Some questions and answers about student loan debt and the scheduled interest rate hike:  Q: How big of a problem is student loan debt?  A: U.S. student loan debt has surpassed credit card and auto-loan debt, with some estimates putting it at $1 trillion. This debt jeopardizes the fragile recovery and increases the burden on taxpayers. About two-thirds of student loan debt is held by people under 30, according to the New York Fed. Borrowers owe a median $12,800, an amount even advocates for student borrowers acknowledge is usually manageable and more than worthwhile factoring in the economic benefits of a college degree. However, not all borrowers complete a degree -- and the average balance is considerably higher than the median: about $23,000. That reflects a relatively small number of borrowers with very large balances.  Q: Are there signs of improvement?  A: Unlike other forms of consumer debt, student loan debt is growing. The most recent figures show new college graduates with loans owed more than $25,000 when they left school, up 5 percent from the year before. Mark Kantrowitz of the website Finaid.org estimates that 85 percent of student loan debt is owed to the federal government, and those loans typically carry lower rates and borrower protections such as income-based repayment maximums.  However, the number of borrowers defaulting on federal loans has jumped sharply recently. Of 3.6 million borrowers who entered repayment in fiscal 2009, nearly 9 percent defaulted with two years, up from 7 percent for the previous year's cohort. Meanwhile, the College Board said last fall that the average in-state tuition and fees at four-year public colleges rose an additional $631, or about 8 percent, compared with a year ago. The cost of a full credit load has passed $8,000 -- an all-time high.  Q: Why is the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans expected to double?  A: Acting on a Democratic campaign promise in 2006, Democrats in 2007 crafted the law to progressively lower the interest rate from 6.8 percent to the 3.4 percent rate -- where it is this school year -- and then return to the original 6.8 percent in 2012. Republican President George W. Bush signed the deal into law after it was approved by bipartisan but Democratic-heavy majorities in both chambers. Congress wrote the law this way for one simple reason, says Jason Delisle, director of the federal education budget project at the New America Foundation: cost. It would cost an additional $6 billion annually to keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent.  Q: Are there people who aren't affected by the rate increase?  A: Students issued loans before July 1 won't be hit with the higher rate. It also doesn't affect the interest rates on unsubsidized Stafford loans (now at 6.8 percent) and PLUS loans for parents (now at 7.9 percent). Unlike subsidized Stafford loans, unsubsidized Stafford loans are not based on financial need.  Q: What is the reaction from Congress?  A: Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, has said he and his Republican colleagues are exploring options ""in hopes of finding a responsible solution that serves borrowers and taxpayers equally well."" He said lofty campaign promises put them in an ""untenable situation"" and they now must choose between allowing interest rates to rise or ""piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers."" In the Senate, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said this week he intends to introduce legislation that would extend the interest rate for another year. Then, next year, Harkin said when the Higher Education Act is up for reauthorization, a longer term fix could be reached. He said they are looking at funding options.  ----------  AP Education Writer Justin Pope contributed to this report.",0,,,0.0,0

1148,"Sen. Grassley, our overtaxed sanity is a bigger problem than overtaxed estates","U.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley's recent remarks on the estate tax are getting lots of attention. Just Google 'booze.""

""I think not having the estate tax recognizes the people that are investing,"" Grassley, R-Iowa, said, according to The Des Moines Register, ""as opposed to those that are just spending every darn penny they have, whether it's on booze or women or movies."" The story featuring his quotes appeared over the weekend, and drew plenty of you-know-what from his critics.
For people inheriting multimillion estates, a tidy tax break. For us bleacher bums, a stern lecture from the luxury box of American politics. For women, yet another moment when you can, in the phrasing of a famous Grassley tweet, assume man clueless.  This also strikes me as cruel, and not because the senator neatly divided us up into a prudent, industrious investor class, worthy of reward, and a drunken rabble blowing its dough on hedonistic whim, worthy of senatorial scorn. It's cruel because a leader of the Republican Party, which gleefully served us the spirit-breaking, mendacity-smothered presidency of Donald Trump, now is deriding even our meager means of momentary escape. Seriously?  Imagine these many months without booze, entertainment and, if you'll allow me to make a substitution on the senator's list, free and fully consensual canoodling. The extra scratch these fleeting comforts might costs us is what I call a sanity tax. And it may very well be we're now paying the highest sanity tax in American history. Higher than the estate tax.  Grassley and his Senate colleagues are in a unique position to cut the sanity tax. But that would require standing up to Trumpian insanity. Not likely, sports fans. In fact, Grassley would rather use his Judiciary Committee to fill the federal bench with young disciples of Don.  See? Now you're going to need another bottle. And, somewhere, Bruce Braley is raising a tall glass of I-told-you-so.  On Monday Grassley sought to clarify, insisting he'd been ""taken out of context."" He then basically repeated his flawed core argument, sans the handy list of questionable purchases keeping us from becoming millionaires.  Truth is, the vast majority of Iowans, including folks who never buy a bottle, a movie ticket or a weekend at Mar-a-Lago, will not pass on an estate large enough — $5.4 million for individuals, $11 million for couples — to be subject to the estate tax. This is a top-shelf, single-malt tax cut for folks inheriting serious wealth. Federal debt covers the tab.  And really, the most important investments in this equation were made by very wealthy GOP campaign donors. These are folks who include ""senators"" on their shopping lists.  The 2014 U.S. Senate race in Iowa cost more than $60 million, speaking of throwing away pennies. The winner promised to ""make 'em squeal,"" and this tax bill no doubt is eliciting squeals of delight from those donors.  Amid trying times like these, I'll turn to my Lutheran heritage for guidance.  ""Who loves not woman, wine, and song, remains a fool his whole life long,"" said the original Lutheran, Martin Luther, according to many sources. Sure, there's also precious little evidence he ever actually said it. But why doubt? Have a little faith. And some wine, while we suffer fools.  .

1151,"Mass legislators approve bill to protect renters, mortgage payers","State legislators have approved a temporary statewide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

The Massachusetts House and Senate Friday approved the measure, which awaits the signature of Gov. Charlie Baker, who in March declared a state of emergency because of the virus.
The legislation would provide protections to renters, small businesses and homeowners experiencing financial hardships.  Because of the emergency situation, the bill will take effect once the governor signs it.  For renters, it would prohibit ""non-essential evictions"" but would allow landlords to initiate an eviction action due to criminal activity or lease violations that are detrimental to the health and safety of others.  The protections would also apply to for-profit and non-profit small businesses with less than 150 full-time equivalent employees, provided they are not publicly traded and do not operate in multiple states or multi-nationally.  While the moratorium is in effect, landlords would also be prohibited from imposing a late fee on tenants or notifying a consumer reporting agency for non-payment of rent, as long as the tenant provides notice and documentation to the landlord their inability to pay on time is due to the financial impacts of COVID-19. Tenants will have 30 days from the date rent is due to provide the information, but will still be obligated to make up any missed payments at a later date.  Additional language inserted in the bill would allow landlords to use their tenants' pre-paid ""last month's rent"" as an advance rent payment to cover mortgage payments, utilities, repairs and required upkeep of the rental property. Landlords are required to notify tenants if they take such action, and would remain obligated to apply advance rent for its intended application for the last month of tenancy.  For homeowners, the legislation prohibits mortgagees and creditors from publishing notice of a foreclosure sale, exercising a power of sale, exercising a right of entry, initiating a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure process, or filing a complaint to determine the military status of a mortgagor under the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.  House Bill 4647 also requires mortgagees and creditors to grant forbearance for homeowners who request one due to the financial impact of the virus. The forbearance cannot exceed 180 days, during which time no penalties, fees or interest will accrue. Any payments subject to the forbearance will be added to the end of the term of the loan unless otherwise agreed to by the mortgagor and mortgagee.  The bill also allows homeowners applying for a reverse mortgage to receive statutorily mandated counseling through video conferencing, rather than face-to-face.  The legislation reflects compromise language negotiated by a six-member conference committee made up of representatives and senators.  The protections provided to homeowners and renters will remain in effect for 120 days after the bill's effective date, or 45 days after the state of emergency is lifted, whichever is sooner. The bill also allows Baker to postpone the scheduled sunset dates in increments of not more than 90 days, as long as the postponement does not extend later than 45 days after the state of emergency is lifted.",0,,,0.0,0
1152,Gawker Media founder files for personal bankruptcy,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Gawker Media Chief Executive Nick Denton filed for personal bankruptcy protection on Monday, according to court documents that name his largest creditor as Hulk Hogan, a former professional wrestler who won a $140 million court judgment against the news website over a sex tape it posted.

Denton listed assets of $10 million to $50 million and liabilities of $100 million to $500 million in his Chapter 11 petition filed at the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
Earlier on Monday, he tweeted that he wanted to protect colleagues from a ""vendetta"" by tech billionaire Peter Thiel, who funded Hogan's Florida lawsuit.  Gawker Media filed for bankruptcy in June after Hogan won the judgment. The wrestler had accused the site of violating his privacy by posting a sex tape featuring Hogan having sex with the wife of his then-best friend, the radio shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge Clem.  According to court documents, Denton is personally liable for $125 million of the $140 million judgment won by Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea.  Thiel is an early backer and board member of Facebook who was angry over Gawker's writings about him and his friends in Silicon Valley. Gawker had published an article in 2007 about Thiel's homosexuality.  Thiel's involvement has raised alarm bells in U.S. media circles over whether wealthy individuals are trying to muzzle the press.  David Houston, Hogan's attorney, issued a statement saying Denton's bankruptcy ""has nothing to do with who paid (Hogan's) legal bills, and everything to do with Denton's own choices and accountability. If even one person has been spared the humiliation that (Hogan) suffered, this is a victory.""  When Gawker filed for bankruptcy, the U.S. internet publisher automatically received the shield against Hogan's judgment that Denton had been seeking from both a New York bankruptcy court and Florida courts. Denton had said in court pleadings that without protection, Hogan would immediately begin to seize his assets.  On Twitter, Denton said on Monday ""On this bitter day for me, I am consoled by the fact that my colleagues will soon be freed from this tech billionaire' s vendetta.""  Thiel did not immediately return a request for comment. A spokeswoman for Denton declined to comment further.  Gawker filed for bankruptcy with a plan to sell itself to media company Ziff Davis LLC for $90 million. That offer sets the floor for bids in a court-supervised auction scheduled for later this summer.  Reuters reported earlier that Denton would file for bankruptcy as soon as Monday. ",0,,,0.0,0
1155,Entrepreneurial inspiration,"Becoming an entrepreneur takes creativity, determination and passion. Just throw in good luck and a truckload of money, and you've got it made. Or do you?

For most entrepreneurs, passion for something is king. Consider Barbara Crews, who loves antique cookie jars so much, she's made a business out of selling them at antique shows.
For some, the key is inventiveness, as it was for the woman who wanted to become a lawyer but failed her LSAT exam. In a rush one day, she cut the feet off her panty hose and threw them on to create a smooth silhouette under her pants. Forget law. She now owns a multibillion-dollar underwear business.  Being an entrepreneur usually starts with a dream, an accidental vision, a wish to be the king or queen of your own kingdom. It requires a desire to play the rules of work your way — to do the daily business just as Frank Sinatra sang in ""My Way.""  But how do you get there?  First, it requires personal characteristics that subscribe to a principle of hard, diligent, informed and dedicated work. You will need operating capital — a loan from your bank, family or a hefty credit line on a plastic credit card. You may need some staff. You will need an efficient and congenial place to work for you and however many staff members you'll need.  You also will need physical, mental and emotional stamina to weather the financial and emotional ups and downs of being an entrepreneur.  Your pathway to entrepreneurship will require emotional and professional support from your staff. But the rewards: It's your kingdom. You are in charge. You are your own boss.  The Oklahoman talked to entrepreneurs, ranging in age from the late 20s to the late 70s, to find out what they loved most about being an entrepreneur, and what were the obstacles they had to overcome.  Each story, each motivation, recalls a singular moment in the entrepreneur's life when he chose to make his business life a work of his own choosing.  Joy Reed Belt  ""Did you want to start with the lemonade stand?"" Joy Reed Belt said with a laugh. ""I really had one. I also had a book-leasing company in grade school, where I would lease books to students for a nickel or a dime. Or were you more interested in my time in graduate school when I was the landlord of an old mansion in Arkansas, where I rented out rooms to female graduate students?""  That was a very successful venture, Belt said, so successful she didn't have to borrow money to attend graduate school.  She officially became an entrepreneur in 1979, working out of a bedroom she converted to her office, and began her executive search company. By 1992, her business was so successful, she bought a large two-story building on Grand Boulevard and Western that is often called ""the pink building with the purple door, next door to Flip's.""  The interiors are filled with antiques and fine art, a library, a full kitchen and rooms where people looking for executive positions can work on their resumes, often with personal advice from Belt, based on her immense experience and expertise.  ""I like the act of creating,"" Belt said. ""That always has been fascinating to me. When you're starting something you've never done before, friends want a template they can follow, too. I'm hooked on this creative business. I love the process of figuring out how to do something I've never done before. This business as an executive search consultant is really my child.""  Belt balances two businesses. In 2001, Belt's husband, attorney John Belt, bought her some painting lessons to encourage her to relax. The gift didn't quite work out the way John planned. She found making collages more creative than painting, but she learned about art while taking those lessons.  In 2001, she became part owner of a gallery in The Paseo. In 2005, she and John bought the former home of Nan Sheets, founder of the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, and restored its position in the community as a fine art gallery.  Today, JRB Art at the Elms is known for its unusual monthly shows that feature a variety of art mediums. In May, she will move both of her businesses to the Paseo gallery, leaving behind the pink building she has called her business home for 16 years. Chesapeake Energy has bought that building.  Her advice to budding entrepreneurs?  ""You have to have a high tolerance for risk. You have to promote yourself and your business. Know your clients' background so you know how to help them. Be competitive and adaptable. As an entrepreneur, there's no guarantee you're going to get a regular paycheck. You have to believe you can do it. Believe in yourself and follow your dream.""  Cher Bumps  ""I didn't plan to be an entrepreneur,"" Cher Bumps said. ""It was accidental. I didn't grow up to own a company. I was a sociology major in college with a minor in French.""  There's not much French being spoken on the 10th floor of The Oil Center, where Bumps operates her insurance business. But if you like to talk about employee benefits, she'll listen.  She started her career as a merchandising manager with J.C. Penney Co. Inc., and her husband was then a young executive with Wilson Foods. Then, she was approached to sell insurance for Connecticut Mutual Life and handle its employee benefits program.  ""There was a salary, no risk, and it seemed worth a shot,"" she remembers.  On April Fools Day 1985, Bumps took the leap and went out on her own and formed CABA, an acronym for Cher A. Bumps Associates, and she seldom looks back. In 1987, she incorporated the company. By 2002, she had 125 employees and offered every type of self-funded insurance to a variety of individuals and companies, serving a multitude of needs for her large clientele.  She helps employers work with benefits that make a business environment user-friendly, not only to executives but to all the support personnel and clients.  While she has trimmed her staff to 14 and sold off some aspects of the company, she is proud of the fact that many of her clients have been with her since she opened the business.  ""We have a philosophy here that asks, 'How hard can that be?' or 'We can do this, can't we?'"" she says.  Bumps deals daily with such life-changing issues as long-term care, disability, life insurance and retirement planning options.  There's a side to Bumps probably known only by her employees and closest friends. She has five therapists on the staff to help employees deal with issues such as divorce and depression, credit problems, wayward children and aging parents. She encourages her employees to take paid time off to attend school functions with their children.  ""We are a very close-knit family,"" she says. ""I consider it a compliment that when I walk in an employee's office, they don't stop talking to their co-workers.  Lisa Shambour  Lisa Shambour was 12 years old when she had her first facial, and it hooked her for life. This year, she is celebrating her 10th anniversary as owner of Lisa's Belle de Jour, a spa boutique at 4410 N Western. For eight years, the spa was on Britton Road.  When she opened her spa, there were plenty of hair salons that offered pedicures and manicures, but very few spas devoted to skin care.  A graduate of the University of Central Oklahoma with a degree in fashion merchandising, she always wanted to own a clothing store. Her boutique does sell some jewelry, but Shambour's main mission is to sell skin-care products.  As a full-service spa, she offers manicures, pedicures, hair styling, massages, exfoliation and pigmentation treatments, micro-dermabrasion, and lash and brow tinting. ""We take care of our clients from head to toe,"" she said.  She brings to the spa her experience of being trained in German and French skin-care techniques in Paris.  ""Skin care is a big part of the European lifestyle,"" Shambour said. ""In France, it's a necessity. French people like to feel good inside and out, and they are very conscious of proper skin care. It seems to me the French age very gracefully.""  What Shambour also provides to her clients is a delightful atmosphere, based on her love for Paris. The decor is feminine, with a pink-and-black color scheme, accented by red. Several of the rooms are dressed in a soft light green to provide some contrast to the pink and black. The eye-catching pink velvet love seat stars in the main reception area, accented with accessories that Shambour calls ""modern-day Paris.""  While she loves the setting she has created for her clients, Shambour said, ""Meeting people and helping them feel good about themselves is the best part of owning the spa.""  Dr. Bobby Roberson  Bobby Roberson has a favorite line about life — his life as an entrepreneur. The author is unknown but the quote reads, ""Live so that when you are old, you can look back on your life without regret.""  Roberson is 77, agile, quick-witted, a snappy dresser, a gentleman, a marathon runner and an entrepreneur respected by the employees of the company he founded, BMI Systems Corp., 913 N Broadway in Oklahoma City. He looks back without regret.  Roberson's enterprise began in his garage, where he repaired typewriters. Even when he was in the military, as officers discovered his talent, he would be moved from more dangerous positions to the safety of a shelter where he could repair typewriters. It seems a singular skill to Roberson.  Over the years, he worked for most of the major typewriter companies such as Underwood and Royal, and local companies.  Although he turned over the reins of the company to his son Shannon, Roberson still keeps close ties with the company. He recently received his master's degree in business from a Kentucky university. ""I wanted the degree to hang on my wall,"" he said.  His two children and grandchildren all have college degrees, and Roberson thought it was time to join the ranks of the family's degree holders. He also has an honorary doctorate from Oklahoma Christian College.  He grew up rather impoverished in Texas and New Mexico and couldn't afford college, yet he is close friends with six presidents of regional universities, including David Boren of the University of Oklahoma.  He compares his success as an entrepreneur to boxing. He was a Golden Gloves champion for six years, and he says boxing and business have much in common.  ""In both, you get knocked down,"" he said, ""but you have to get up, again and again.""",0,,,0.0,0
1159,Slump means it's time to look at spreading risk: Review of asset allocation can ease anxiety  ,"There have been trying times lately for investors and their digestive systems as the Toronto stock market staged a correction as a lengthy unbroken string of advances on the backs of commodity stocks started to flame out in May.  

By late June, the Toronto market's main index was down 12 per cent from its peak April 19.  
The temptation is to flee the market and head for the hills during times like these but analysts say that could be a big mistake.    ""It's a good time to take a good, hard look at asset allocation,"" said Patricia Lovett-Reid, vice-president TD Waterhouse.    ""And buy into some of these good quality equities that they tend to hold for the long term. And I'm talking blue chip, dividend-paying, real earning companies that have been taken down with the tide.""    Asset allocation is an extremely important exercise. It spreads out risk by spreading your money out between bonds, stocks and cash.    And it can become unbalanced during strong periods in the stock markets when investors find themselves putting too much money in one area.    Likewise, these same people can be found upping their fixed income component to an unhealthy degree at a time when equities are slipping.    ""For the average investor out there, with a reasonable time horizon, a conservatively balanced portfolio will be 50-50 (stocks versus fixed income- cash),"" said Reid.    ""And it does make sense even when the markets are on a tear.""    However, portfolio makeup is a very personal decision based on risk -- and the recent shakeup may convince some investors that the stock market is not where they want to be -- period.    ""For the person who is risk averse, and can't stand the ups and downs, that person really shouldn't be in too much of a equity side,"" said Adrian Mastracci at KCM Wealth Management in Vancouver.    ""Maybe at best, be in something with a dividend attached to it. They're going to fluctuate but they're not going to be falling out of bed.""    But while you're sleeping better, you will have a tough time making big gains with too much fixed income.    ""You will have to take on some corporate risk,"" said Mastracci.    ""Maybe you can have a diversified portfolio, some shorter term stuff, maybe some Canada, some provincials, some corporate, where the average might be 4.5 per cent, let's say, that's probably reasonable, realistic.""    Analysts also point out that the Toronto market is down about 12 per cent from its peak in April -- which is fairly shallow as far as corrections go. But necessary since commodities and resource stocks had run up far too much, too fast.    ""Historically, we get a 10 to 15 per cent correction every four or five years and the odd five per cent correction in between,"" said financial planner Richard Yasinskin of Financially Sound in Stittsville, Ont.    ""So I think we need to go to 15 per cent and then take a look. I'm saying we haven't had a 15 per cent correction since the market dropped, since the tech wreck in 2003. We could easily see a 15 per cent correction from peak to trough.""  ",0,,,0.0,0

1165,"'Terrible, mean and wicked': Byker daughter cruelly conned her own mum out of £86,000","Susan King, of Byker, caused the victim to go from living a comfortable life to sharing meals for one with her

Wicked Susan King has been jailed after cruelly conning her own mum out of £86,000 to fund her gambling and alcohol habits.
The 46-year-old fraudster emptied her mother's bank account, built up debts in her name and released equity from her home without her knowledge.  King, who lived with her mum, hid mail to conceal bills and statements from her, set up a secret account to divert her pensions into and pressured her to sign documents while refusing to reveal what they were for.  Newcastle Crown Court  heard the victim went from living a comfortable life to having to share meals for one with King.  Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw told the court the victim was at an emotional low due to the recent loss of her husband and was in poor health at the time of the offending.  The court heard it was when King, who was hooked on drink and online gambling, jetted off on holiday to Tenerife in October 2018 that discarded debt letters were found in her bedroom and the police became involved.  She was arrested at the airport when she got back to the UK and initially claimed her mum had told her the money was ""ours"".  King, of St. Anne's Close, Byker , Newcastle, later admitted fraud.  Mr Wardlaw said: ""From the time the defendant took over managing her mother's affairs, the mother never saw a bank statement, telling her all banking was done online and there were no paper statements.  ""Due to a health condition, her mother couldn't use a keyboard or go on the internet.""  The court heard by the time the truth was revealed, King had put her mother's bank account up to its £2,000 overdraft limit, ran up over £13,000 in credit card bills and left £6,323 of utility bills unpaid.  Mr Wardlaw said: ""The total amount obtained by the defendant was £86,493.""  But Mr Wardlaw said the Virgin Media package was cut off at the house after the bill was unpaid and added: ""Carers noted the complainant and the defendant sharing meals for one.""  Recorder Jennifer Carter-Manning jailed King for three years.  The judge issued a five year restraining order which prevents King being left alone with her mother and means any contact between the mum and daughter must be supervised by a family member or carer.  The judge told King: ""This is a considerable fraud which would be bad in any circumstances. The particular sadness of this is that the victim is your own mother.  ""There has been a serious detrimental impact on your mother, both financially, in that you have deprived her of equity in her home and run up debts that now sit against her name, and emotionally, in that she has clearly and understandably suffered at your hands.  ""There is no doubt in my mind your mother was particularly vulnerable , in particular because of her physical condition but also because of your joint recent bereavement.""  Prosecutors have launched proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act to get the money back but Mr Wardlaw said her assets will be ""nominal"" and that the process is to ensure that any future wealth, such as a lottery win, can be seized.  David Lamb, defending, handed in ""powerful"" references to King's previous positive character and said she accepts what she did was ""terrible, mean and wicked"".  Mr Lamb said King, who now has no contact with her mother and has been ""disowned"" by her family, led an industrious life and reached management level in her career.  He said she left work in 2014 to look after her parents when her father became ill and her life ""spiralled out of control"".  He added: ""She consumed excessive amounts of alcohol when alone at night. She began to abuse online gambling sites, as a source of solace, seeking escape from the demands of the regime of caring for both of her parents.  Mr Lamb said King was ""seduced by the bright lights and easy winnings"" offered by online gambling sites but soon ended up ""chasing her losses"".  The court heard King has sought professional help and is now sober and no longer using the gambling sites.",0,,,0.0,0
1166,Double the pain for savers as punishing inflation pushes prices up while rates fall,"Savers face a double whammy of punishing inflation and paltry savings rates.

Inflation jumped to 3.1 per cent in November, its highest level since March 2012.
It means there are no savings accounts that even match the rate of inflation, let alone outpace it.  The rate you can earn on some accounts has risen slightly since Bank of England base rate went up from 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent last month.  But overall, the average savings rate has actually fallen over the past 15 months.  When base rate last stood at 0.5 per cent in August last year, the average easy-access savings rate was 0.55 per cent, says data analyst Moneyfacts. Inflation was then running at 0.6 per cent.  Today, the average rate is a lower 0.47 per cent and inflation is up at 3.1 per cent.  Rising inflation and low interest rates reduces the spending power of your savings pot.  Even earning the top 1.3 per cent in the best easy-access account, its value drops by 1.8 per cent a year (3.1 per cent minus 1.3 per cent) after interest has been added.  This means that over a year, £10,000 will devalue to £9,820.  And if your cash is sitting in the average account, you’ll lose 2.63 per cent a year, with £10,000 worth £9,737 after 12 months.  sy.morris@dailymail.co.uk",1,,,0.0,0

It may be time to take it on the chin and move on.
","
FOR a country with a population only one-third of the UK's, Australia has
had a significant impact on our way of life. In the media, who can doubt the
collective impact of Clive James, Germaine Greer and Dame Edna Everidge? In
sports, not satisfied with showing us how it's done in cricket, rugby and
tennis, we now have the likes of Harry Kewell improving the English Premier
League. And as if things couldn't get any worse, adopted Aussie Mel Gibson
ends up as Braveheart.



But they haven't faired so well when it comes to money. Their foray into UK
banking has been unspectacular and their attempt to breathe new life into
the pensions and life assurance industry has ended up in tatters. Even the
Aussies in the shape of AMP have failed to breathe new life into a Victorian
savings product. AMP announced last week what it called a radical
restructuring involving the with-profits policyholders of NPI, Pearl and
London Life. And we all know what radical restructuring means, don't we?

 It was also rumoured these companies' with-profits funds would not accept new business from now and the investment fund would get rid of its equity holdings, leaving it with only gilts, fixed interest or property in the fund in future. So just when the industry seemed to have weathered the worst financial storms for more than 70 years, the Aussies are throwing in the towel.    But is there a future for the with-profits policy? In my view, the writing has been on the wall for these products for 30 years.    In the very early 70s, the with-profits concept worked fairly well, providing decent long-term returns to endowment and pension investors. But economic circumstances and our way of life were different then. Savers had much longer-term horizons. People worked in the same career to 65 or later and often worked with the same employer throughout a working lifetime.    Back then, we had come through a period of low inflation, low interest rates and little opposition to the with-profits concept.    Typical terms for policies in these days were 35 years or longer and it was common for severe penalties to apply for those who cashed in early. And inside pension policies, there were Draconian penalties for those who were unfortunate enough to die before retirement.    So thanks to a combination of investor patience, long-term horizons, benign economic circumstances and the ability of the fund managers to massage investment returns by being able to penalise early leavers and early deaths, returns were reasonable for those lucky enough to keep the plans over the term. But they were inflexible and would not cope with short-term horizons.    They would also find it difficult to cope with rapidly-changing tax legislation, demographic pressures and developments within the investment world, all of which added up to a need for greater flexibility. This is not a word to describe old with-profits plans.    So as the careers and needs of investors changed the old with-profits Victorian model was losing the battle. In a vain attempt to compete, the wise succumbed to sales and marketing visions and common sense went out the window. With-profits performances looked better because they plundered the kitty.    The purpose of the kitty was to provide bonuses in all the years, even the bad ones. As everybody knows, you get good years and bad years and with-profits were supposed to keep a healthy kitty to make up for the bad years.    Things were made worse by simultaneously continuing to back equities at the wrong time. They're not the only ones who got it wrong. But once the equity markets start looking positive again, the worst thing that could happen to with-profits funds is you chuck in the towel at the wrong time.    If I had been the Aussies, I wouldn't have had anything to do with with-profits in the first place because the damage had been done a long time ago.    But what do you do if you're left with one of these plans? I would be prepared to take it on the chin in most cases, swallow the penalties now and redirect savings into better-managed, tax-efficient investment plans sitting inside the best modern structure, not some rehash of another Victorian folly.

1170,Buy-to-let: Landlords' agony could be contagious   ,"Buy-to-let risks being the brick that knocks the housing market down as the one-time can't-lose route to millionaire status unravels. Amateur landlords are facing big jumps in mortgage repayments - assuming they can find a loan as the credit crunch forces lenders out of the market.   

Many will give up and hand in the keys - especially those who bought newly built flats in the past two years, some of which have halved in value.   
And the great unknown is whether longer-standing investors will cash in as the capital gains tax rate falls for housing investments from up to 40% to 18% from April 6. Some estimates put the number of properties to be sold as high as 20%. The downturn in buy-to-let is expected to have an impact beyond the pounds 15bn two-bedroom-flat market on to the rest of the housing market, according to research published this week.     ""The buy-to-let market is simply not large enough to cause a general downturn all by itself,"" says Fitch, the credit ratings agency, in its report Demystify ing UK Buy to Let. ""But the high concentration of buy-to-let in the crucial London market, and ill-judged media speculation, could trigger a domino effect that impacts the wider market.""     The report also cites the rapid construction of flats as fuelling fears of over-supply. Thousands of newly built flats in cities such as Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham, as well as London, remain empty or let at rents that do not cover mortgages.     ""Funding is now severely limited,"" says banking analyst Alex Potter at stockbrokers Collins Stewart. ""Several lenders are buy-to-let dependent and buy-to-let has never been tested in a market downturn.""     Moneyfacts, the data provider, calculates that 3,662 buy-to-let mortgages were available last August. Now there are only 926 and this week alone three major buy-to-let lenders have pulled out of significant market sectors.     Birmingham Midshires, the buy-to-let specialist in the  HBOS empire, withdrew its ""110% rental cover"" loans, where it would lend if the mortgage was covered 110% by the expected rent, and now requires at least 125% cover from new borrowers. Wave, part of  Merrill Lynch, stopped offering ""almost prime"" buy-to-let loans. ""Almost prime"" means the borrower has one or two black credit-record marks.     And buy-to-let specialist Paragon, which has run out of money for new loans with the ending of a funding facility, has withdrawn its range. It is now limited to topping up existing borrowers depending on the amount it redeems from those re-mortgaging or paying off their loans.     Paragon has a pounds 12bn mortgage book and although its typical loan-to-value is 65%, many customers borrowed far greater percentages to buy new-build flats. Its shares have fallen 85% to 103p since buy-to-let lending hit its peak in the middle of 2006.     In June 2006, the most attractive buy-to-let pounds 200,000 loan cost 4.49% fixed for two years with a 1.5% fee, amounting to pounds 832.90 a month. Now the best value is 5.34% fixed for two years plus a 2.5% fee - pounds 906.85 a month, according to Moneyfacts.     But these are the best loans. Those who bought flats that have fallen in value are forced on to standard variable rates that can be as high as 8.75% - the rate charged by specialist lender GMAC.     GMAC has customers whose repayments per property could rise by more than pounds 500 a month - an amount that is almost impossible to recoup from tenants. But as GMAC sold on its loans, no one really knows who will pick up the losses for the bad debts. Much of the buy-to-let market is characterised by packaging and selling on of loans.     For example, Chris Miller, from Bedford, bought 31 flats valued by surveyors at pounds 7.5m late last summer for pounds 6.4m. He borrowed pounds 6.4m, much of it from GMAC. But when nearly all were repossessed this year as he could not rent them, he found that many of the loans had been sold on to the likes of  Bradford & Bingley and  Morgan Stanley. His port folio is unlikely to fetch more than pounds 3m at auction, a pounds 3.4m loss to lenders.     Fitch argues that even when flats have tenants, the typical gross rental yield of about 5% falls to 3% once empty periods and maintenance are factored in. This compares with returns of 6% or more from savings accounts.     ""A first test of the sector's impact will follow the introduction of the lower capital gains rate,"" Fitch adds. ""Our view is that buy-to-let constitutes a segment of the housing market which is more likely to accelerate, rather than dampen, a downturn environment.""     Potter, at Collins Stewart, agrees: ""No one knows the concentration risk - how much is in overpriced new-build flats - or just how well the typical two-year mortgage duration is suited to buy-to-let. Lenders believed the benign conditions would go on for ever. But if building slows, the Polish construction workers so many landlords need will go back home. And then the buy-to-let tail could wag the property dog.""     Battersea Reach flats on the river Thames. There is a fear of oversupply in London and elsewhere   ",0,,,0.0,0
1171,"Money in America: Stay focused, remember priorities for a fulfilling retirement","Editor’s note : We reached out to executives who work in financial planning for their thoughts on what people should be thinking about at various life stages for wealth management. Here are comments as conveyed by Joe Vietri, branch network leader at Charles Schwab.

In Your 20s
While it might seem far-off, your 20s is the prime time to start saving and planning for retirement — thanks to the power of compound interest.  * Start saving for retirement early. It's a long way off, but put retirement on your list of goals. If your employer offers a 401(k) or a Roth 401(k), aim to contribute 10 percent to 15 percent of your income. The longer you wait to start, the larger the percentage you’ll need to save. If you don’t have a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, open a Roth IRA. A Roth is a good choice for a young person because, while you don’t get the tax advantage up front, withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, when you’ll likely be in a higher tax bracket.  * Don’t leave “free money” on the table. Most companies will match a portion of your 401(k) contributions. Sign up and contribute at least enough to qualify for the max. Some employers also may make annual contributions to your tax-advantaged health savings accounts or offer the option to buy company stock at a discount. Familiarize yourself with these benefits and take advantage.  * Invest for growth. While you’re young, invest in a growth strategy since you’ve got time on your side to recover from a potential down market. Be diversified and think about your risk tolerance, but at this stage, you should focus on asset growth.  * Start a rainy-day fund. Schwab’s Modern Wealth Index (MWI) found that only 28 percent of millennials have an emergency fund to cover three months of expenses. Be sure to prepare for emergencies, such as job loss, with three to six months’ worth of living expenses.  * Pay down debt. MWI found only 33 percent of millennials make all loan payments and 31 percent pay their credit cards in full each month. Student loans and credit card debt can add up, and missing payments can hurt your credit score, which matters for rent and loan assessments.  In Your 30s  As you enter your 30s, there are competing demands on your time and money. Whether it be saving for your kids’ education or contributing toward your retirement, here are key things to keep in mind for these years.  * Keep saving. If you’re just starting, aim to save 15 percent to 20 percent of your income. If you've been saving 10 percent to 15 percent for retirement since your 20s, good work, and keep it up!  * Get a financial plan. Planning is one of the most critical factors to successful investing, but Schwab’s research reveals that less than a quarter of Americans have a written financial plan. A comprehensive financial plan is your road map to help you stay on track with your financial goals and manage wealth, particularly as your life evolves and finances become more complicated.  * Remember your old 401(k) when changing jobs. Your 30s are a time of professional advancement, so if you are changing jobs, don’t blindly leave your 401(k) savings in the rear view. When you switch jobs, you can leave your money where it is, roll it over into your new employer's 401(k) plan, or roll it over into an individual retirement account. You can also cash it out, but that’s almost never a good idea. To decide which is best for you, consider how your fees, taxes and investment options may be impacted.  * Start saving early for kids' college. If you begin investing $300 per month as soon as your child is born, with a 6 percent rate of return, you could have $115,000 by the time he/she reaches age 18. Yet, if you don’t start saving until your child is 10 years old, the final amount will be roughly $37,000.  * Create an estate plan. At the very minimum, you should establish a will that names a guardian for your children (if you have any). You also should make sure you name beneficiaries for all retirement accounts, as these designations will take precedence over your will.  In Your 40s  You’re likely earning more as your career advances, but you’re also facing more financial pressures. It’s easy to get distracted, so here are some tips to stay focused.  * Double down on savings. Keep retirement at the top of your priorities. If you haven’t started saving, set aside 25 percent of your salary. You are probably contributing enough to take advantage of your employer’s 401(k) match, but consider maximizing your annual contribution: $18,000 for 2017 for workers under age 50. For both traditional and Roth IRAs, the maximum you can contribute is $5,500 for workers under the age of 50.  * Update your financial plan. You should get in the habit of reviewing your financial plan annually and at major life events to make sure it’s current and that your investment portfolio is aligned with your short- and long-term goals, as well as your risk tolerance. At this stage, you may think about a second home or early retirement, so it’s important to crunch the numbers to see what it will take to reach them.  * Protect yourself and your family. Now that you have more money working for you, make sure you’re protected. Look into disability insurance and consider life insurance if you have dependents.  * Don’t be too conservative. While you shouldn’t take the same risks you did in your 20s, you still have 20+ years to reap potential gains from investments. Being cautious now could mean coming up short later, so consider having a large portion of your portfolio in equities.  * Know your tax profile. Understand how taxes fit into your financial picture, now and in the future.  In Your 50s  As you approach peak earning years in your 50s, it makes sense to start thinking more specifically about retirement planning; it may be only 15 years away. Consider these priorities to make sure you are on track.  * Estimate your retirement expenses. Begin thinking about when you want to retire, where you want to live and what you want to do. Will you travel or work part-time, or move to a different city? Once you know your vision, you can determine how much your retirement is going to cost and how you are going to pay for it.  * Stay on top of your financial plan and your portfolio. Review and update your financial plan and your investment portfolio and consider when it makes sense to begin shifting to a more conservative asset allocation as you near retirement.  * Consider long-term-care insurance. Now’s a practical time to think about it.  * Consider boosting your savings level. As your salary increases, so should your retirement contributions. Starting at age 50, investors can contribute an extra $6,000 to their 401(k) for an annual contribution of $24,000, and an extra $1,000 to their IRA for an annual contribution of $6,500, per current IRS rules.  * Update your estate plan. Make sure that your will and beneficiaries are up to date and that your assets are appropriately titled.  In Your 60s  With retirement nearing, it’s imperative that people in their 60s focus on preparations for life after work.  * Understand your real spending. While many guess how much they spend, it’s important to be accurate — so dig up bank statements and look at what the real outflow is.  * Tackle debt and major expenses. Fifty seven percent of Americans can’t make loan payments on time and 63 percent hold credit card debt (according to recent Schwab research), so this is the time to pay down “bad” debt before it becomes a burden in retirement.  * Decide when to take Social Security. Many people file for Social Security too early, leaving thousands of dollars on the table. You should keep in mind, the longer you wait up to age 70, the bigger your check once you begin collecting.  * Sign up for Medicare: Unless you’re still working, you must sign up by age 65 or face a penalty. As medical costs can be a big part of retirement expenses, be sure to look into a supplemental policy, too.  * Fine-tune your retirement income plan. Review your projected expenses, add up your reliable sources of income and figure out how your portfolio will cover the gap. Consider gradually moving to a more conservative asset allocation, but don’t walk away from growth: Retirement can last a long time — approximately 20 years or more.  In Your Retirement  With Americans living longer than ever, retirement is increasingly becoming its own journey rather than a destination. For a lengthy, fulfilling retirement, start with this checklist.  * Review your situation. Project what you’ll need to cover one month’s and one year’s costs, divvying expenses into essential (housing, health care) and discretionary (trips) categories.  * Explore retirement income strategies. A few common approaches include relying upon 1) interest and dividends only, 2) a “total return” strategy, which uses a combination of interest, dividends and withdrawals from principal, and 3) a “total return” with an annuity that incorporates annuity income into a ""total return"" approach.  * Match your investments to your goals and needs. While it’s a crucial factor to consider in creating your retirement income plan, it’s unlikely that savings will ever outpace long-term inflation. One way to counteract this is keeping a segment of savings in growth-oriented stock investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs). Balancing funds – in any distribution – between fixed income, cash investments and stocks is essential to long-term success.  * Rebalance annually and stay flexible. Annual retirement portfolio rebalancing is especially important when you're retired, as a portfolio that's out of balance can leave you with more risk or less growth potential than you want. You should periodically revisit your retirement portfolio asset allocation to stay aligned with your investment goals and expected time horizon.  Did you find this article useful?

1185,HOW THE NEW Â£10 NOTE MEASURES UP,"Just over one billion polymer £10 notes featuring Pride And Prejudice author Jane Austen have been printed ready for issue. Here are some facts and figures about the new tenner:

:: There are 3.7 billion Bank of England banknotes in circulation, of which around 801 million are tenners.
:: The new £10 note is the first Bank of England banknote with a tactile feature to help blind and partially sighted users - a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner.  :: According to the Bank, the first tenner was issued in 1759, printed only on one side and in black and white.  :: Florence Nightingale was the first character to be portrayed on the back of a £10 Bank of England note, in 1975.  :: Security features on the new banknote include a see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait, a quill which changes from purple to orange and a hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted.  :: Winchester Cathedral, where Austen is buried, also features on the new note. It is shown in gold foil on the front and silver on the back.  :: The new note features a portrait of Jane Austen. An engraving was commissioned by her family and based on an original sketch of Austen drawn by her sister, Cassandra Austen. The choice of the portrait has drawn controversy, with some claiming it gives Austen a ""makeover"" compared with her sister's original sketch.  :: The selection of Austen removed the possibility of a long-term absence of women on Bank of England notes, apart from the Queen, after it was announced that Sir Winston Churchill would replace social reformer Elizabeth Fry on the £5 note. The prospect of a lack of female faces on banknotes caused an outcry.  :: The new Austen note joins the £5 note featuring Sir Winston as the Bank of England's first ""family"" of banknotes to be made from polymer.  :: Polymer banknotes last around two-and-a-half times longer than paper ones and are also said to be able to survive a spin in the washing machine.  :: You may also spot Austen on coins - she features on a new £2 coin issued by the Royal Mint.  :: Researchers Consumer Intelligence found more than half (51%) of people say they prefer polymer notes to the old paper money, with many people believing it is more modern and robust.",0,,,0.0,0
1186,"'Produced water' bill interests ag, oil and gas industries","A state bill that will make it easier for oil and gas companies to use ""produced,"" or recycled, water for their operations won the unanimous approval of the House of Representatives Friday and has a few days to be considered by the New Mexico Senate before the 2019 session closes.

The ""Produced Water Act"" is being watched closely by oil and gas producers and agricultural industry members as the Senate Judiciary Committee considers amendments. This year's session ends Saturday afternoon.
""We are monitoring it now because it may be amended,"" said Jim Winchester, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Producers of New Mexico, ""but conceptually, we supported it as it was passed by the House.""  A few provisions of the bill, sponsored by Reps. Nathan Small (D-District 36) and Rod Montoya (R-District 1), include the invalidation of any contract after July 1 that prohibits the use of produced water by oil-and-gas well operators and the clarification of which state agencies have jurisdiction over produced water on various sites.  The current version of the bill gives the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department authority over produced water on oil and gas sites, while the New Mexico Environment Department would regulate produced water used in other industries or for other purposes.  Winchester estimated that 40 percent of southeastern New Mexico oil and gas operators already use produced water, but he said the House bill creates clear ""pathways"" regarding the use and ownership of produced water and likely would encourage more facilities to be developed to distribute or recycle produced water.  Matthew Gonzales, government affairs director for the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, said the group, as well as some related agricultural and conservation groups he has talked with, supported the House version of the bill because it would provide more fresh water to agricultural producers.  ""We see it as an opportunity, one, to clean up produced water in that area, which we see as being a benefit to the state,"" he said. ""A lot of our ranchers and farmers rely on fresh water to put on their crops, so if you have these oil and gas companies that are using more of the produced water, that will free up more of the fresh water for crops.""  He added that at some point in the future, if technology and infrastructure regarding produced water improves, then agricultural lands might be able to use the water for farming and ranching purposes, something he said is not possible now due to both lack of pipelines or storage and distribution facilities and because treatment of the water has not reached the point where produced water is a viable option for agriculture in New Mexico.  Both the Energy Department and the Environment Department reported to the Legislative Finance Committee that the bill would create considerably more demands on their agencies, with more employees or budgetary resources needed in coming years if the bill passes. However, the Fiscal Impact Report produced by the Legislative Finance Committee did not quantify what the state budget implications might be.  A couple of other bills also have been introduced in the Senate, although they have not yet reached the Senate floor by press time, that would give the state Environment Department authority over most aspects of produced water.
