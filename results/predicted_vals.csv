0,Intervention was the right thing to do,"News Intervention was the right thing to do FINANCE  The Bank of England's extraordinary intervention in the UK Government bond market was absolutely necessary. Despite representing an embarrassing U-turn on its recently announced plans to sell £80bn of gilts into the markets, its emergency purchases helped restore stability to UK financial markets.  The need for temporary giltbuying was catalysed by problems arising in UK pension funds, which hold hundreds of billions of pounds in UK gilts.  Record low gilt yields in recent years meant government bond prices rose sharply, earning pension funds large profits. However, with global inflation and interest rates rising all over the world, bond yields have risen during 2022, resulting in significant capital losses for pension investors. The money received from past profits helped them manage those losses but in recent days the situation dramatically worsened.  The loss of confidence in sterling through September sparked a rushed exit from UK assets, pushing 30-year gilt yields above 4 per cent. The day after International Monetary Fund warnings about the direction of UK economic policy, international investors accelerated sales or shorting of UK gilts, causing yields to crash through 5 per cent.  The sudden collapse in gilt prices led financial companies to demand more cash collateral to cover pension fund losses. A £1bn pension fund was, perhaps, suddenly facing cash calls of over £100m. Instead of the usual one or two weeks to allow time for orderly sales, they demanded the money in one or two days. This created a negative spiral because pension funds had run out of buffers and faced either selling gilts or other assets into the falling markets or risking default.  The Bank of England's remit to protect financial stability, required it to step in and stop the situation spinning out of control, reducing 30-year yields to 4 per cent.  Pension funds have been stabilised but it is important to stress that final-salary scheme members were not going to lose all their pensions. They are protected by the Pension Protection Fund, which insures 80-90 per cent of their promised pension.  Defined contribution pension scheme members, whose pensions depend on their investments, and do not promise a specific pension, may have been more severely affected. These funds often have significant investments in gilts and bonds, supposedly to reduce risk and provide stability, but rising bond yields have caused large losses. There is no insurance or employer to underpin these pensions and further bond market crises would mean even lower pensions for members.  The Bank of England's intervention is only a temporary measure. More must be done to restore market confidence. If we are to avoid ongoing financial crises, and pension fund damage, Government must restore confidence in UK economic management. This could include lowering taxes on a wider tax base, boosting private investment, or cutting spending, instead of further unfunded tax cuts.  Baroness Ros Altmann is a Tory peer and pensions expert  Government must restore confidence in UK economic management",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Raphael G. Warnock (D-GA) News Release Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act which would create a phase-in for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act will ensure Georgians may immediately and fully benefit from the cost-cutting and job-creating provisions of the IRA, including tax credits that will lower the costs of electric vehicles.  ""I'm focused squarely on helping Georgia car buyers save money and helping car manufacturers who do business in our state thrive. The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Actwill lower costs for Georgians and provide consumers more options when purchasing an electric vehicle, while also supporting good-paying jobs across our state and bolstering Georgia automakers like Hyundai. I'm going to do everything I can to get this bill over the finish line,"" said Senator Reverend Warnock.  The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would delay the IRA's phase-in period for automakers to follow specific sourcing requirements for their EVs in order for car buyers to qualify for the federal tax credit. These requirements include: requiring the EVs to be manufactured in North America; requiring EV batteries to be made domestically; and mandating that critical minerals used in battery production are only sourced domestically or from nations with whom America has a free trade agreement. Georgia automakers need additional time to meet these new on-shoring requirements and bring planned domestic EV facilities online, including the forthcoming Hyundai EV facility scheduled to open in 2025 in Bryan County, GA.  Senator Warnock has been a vocal champion for creating green jobs and reducing America's reliance on fossil fuels. Last week, Senator Reverend Warnock pushed the Biden Administration to implement the IRA's EV tax credit provision with ""maximum flexibility"" to ensure Georgia car buyers and manufacturers can fully benefit. In February, Senator Warnock announced that he secured nearly $20 million in funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build out Georgia's EV infrastructure network across the state. Additionally, Senator Warnock has been in frequent contact with Hyundai about the auto manufacturer's footprint and future in Georgia, and has encouraged efforts on the federal level to bolster the company's presence--as well as EV and EV battery manufacturing, in general--in the state.

6,Students react to Biden's student debt relief plan,"Students react to Biden's student debt relief plan University of Mississippi ; University, MS - news  By Alyssa Conrad  Graphic by Savannah Shook.  Recently, President Joe Biden made good on his promise to forgive student loan debt. In an official statement addressing the student loan relief plan released on Aug. 24, Biden said it will allow people to ""finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt to get on top of their rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.""  Citizens with annual adjusted gross salaries less than $125,000 (or $250,000 per household) will receive $10,000 off their student loan debt. Citizens with qualifying salaries who are also eligible for a Pell Grant will receive an additional $10,000 off their student loans.  In order to qualify, the loans must be federal, not privately issued. Some current students are also eligible for student loan cancellation, based on free application for federal student aid and whether or not they filed as independent or dependent. Student loan forgiveness for independent students will be based on their own incomes, whereas parent incomes will be taken into account for those who filed as dependents.  Like citizens across the country, UM students have mixed feelings about the plan.  ""I think it's dumb because it's not fixing the underlying problem of higher education being too expensive in the first place,"" Mary-Patt Robben, a sophomore public policy major, said.  Robben believes that student loan forgiveness is not the correct way to combat the increasing cost of a college education and only provides a temporary solution for the issue.  But that isn't how everyone feels about the topic of student loan forgiveness. UM senior Jared Holly, a psychology and nursing major, wholeheartedly supports the new plan.  ""I'm all for it. I'll pay the taxes or whatever it takes. I'm not even necessarily one of those students in debt - I'm grateful to have parents who pay for my education, but I think we should cancel out more,"" Holly said.  Preston Kennedy, a sophomore international studies major also supports the plan, but he thinks that the plan does not go far enough.  ""I feel like, if we're going to spend this much, we should just forgive it all,"" Kennedy said. ""It's a step in the right direction, but if we're willing to spend billions of dollars on this, we should just go all the way.""  It is estimated that around 8 million citizens will get their expected debt forgiveness without needing to take any additional action because their current income information is on file with the U.S. Department of Education. For those without up to date income information on file, there will be an online form released where they can claim the debt forgiveness if they qualify for it. This application is expected to be released within the coming months.  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))",1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0
7,"A GOP attorney general says people are 'celebrating prematurely' Biden's student-loan forgiveness, suggesting lawsuits are to come","A GOP attorney general says people are 'celebrating prematurely' Biden's student-loan forgiveness, suggesting lawsuits are to come * Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told CNBC student-loan forgiveness is being lauded ""prematurely.""  * He said he is looking for ways to legally challenge Biden's debt relief.  * Other GOP lawmakers like Ted Cruz have also said they are pursuing ways to block the policy.  Another Republican politician voiced intentions to legally challenge President Joe Biden's student-loan forgiveness.  Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovichtold CNBC on Tuesday it might be too soon to bank on Biden's announcement to forgive $10,000 to $20,000 in student-loan debt for federal borrowers making under $125,000 a year. He said Biden is on ""very, very shaky legal grounds right now.""  ""I think there's a lot of people celebrating prematurely,"" Brnovich told CNBC. ""A lot of other people are very upset about this, not only because of legal arguments, but because they believe it's fundamentally unfair.""  The Biden administration said the authority to wipe out that debt is granted under the HEROES Act of 2003, which gives the Education Secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like COVID-19.  But critics of the plan have argued that is an overreach of the authority, and the legal grounds do not exist for the president to cancel that amount of student debt.  Brnovich added that a lawsuit should be filed ""sooner rather than later"" so borrowers do not become to reliant on relief, and he said he's confident he can find a plaintiff that could challenge Biden's actions.  ""If we can bring a challenge, we will bring a challenge,"" Brnovich said.  While there was legal debate prior to Biden's announcement of loan forgiveness, the conversation has only amplified since then. Biden's Education and Justice Departments both released memos concluding the Education Secretary does have the authority to enact one-time blanket relief due to pandemic-caused financial hardship, and they also rescinded a memo from former President Donald Trump saying the authority to cancel student debt broadly does not exist.  Still, Republicans and conservative groups have said they are pursuing legal routes to overturn the policy. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, toldThe Washington Post that he is ""brainstorming"" ways to block debt relief after acknowledging it could be difficult to find a plaintiff. Abby Shafroth, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, also previously told Insider that it will be difficult to prove someone has suffered a concrete injury as a result of Biden's debt cancellation.  For now, it's unclear how any legal action will progress, and the Education Department is continuing to tell federal borrowers to prepare for an application for relief to become live in early October, and they will have until the end of next year to submit their form.

10,Drivers face £35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue,"News Drivers face £35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue * Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police  * But at present drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty nor vehicle excise duty  * Government urged to have a 'conversation' with drivers on new ways to be taxed  * The report recommends 'road pricing' which would charge drivers per car trip  Drivers will have to pay new taxes to plug the £35billion shortfall created by the switch to electric cars - and ministers must spell out what they are, a report says today.  The Commons transport committee's report urges the Government to start an 'up-front conversation' with drivers about new ways they could be taxed.  At present, drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty, which nets £28billion a year, or vehicle excise duty, which brings in £7billion.  Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police.  Vehicle excise duty is spent fixing roads. To replace them, the report recommends 'road pricing', which would charge drivers per trip, based on the distance travelled, duration of the journey and vehicle type.  It also urges ministers to set up an arms-length body to recommend a new regime by the end of this year.  The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030, so millions of motorists are expected to go electric before then.  A government spokesman said it was committed to keeping the transition to electric cars 'affordable for consumers'.  Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show plug-in vehicles accounted for more than one in six new cars registered in the UK last year.  'The situation is urgent,' the report warned. 'Work must begin without delay.'  Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said the UK faces a '£35 billion black hole in finances unless the Government acts now'.  He went on: 'That's 4% of the entire tax-take. Only £7 billion of this goes back to the roads; schools and hospitals could be impacted if motorists don't continue to pay.  'We need to talk about road pricing.  'Innovative technology could deliver a national road pricing scheme which prices up a journey based on the amount of road, and type of vehicle, used.'  He added: 'Net-zero emissions should not mean zero tax revenue.'  RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the 'silver lining of zero-carbon motoring comes wrapped in a cloud of trouble for the Chancellor'.  He went on: 'Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next - particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change.  'If the Treasury is thinking it can leave this issue for another day but still recoup their losses from electric vehicles they risk a furious backlash from drivers who made the choice to go electric expecting to save money.'",1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

Bob Menendez issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate's housing subcommittee, today spoke on the Senate floor to warn his colleagues of a looming foreclosure and eviction crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout if Congress fails to act.  ""[A]n impending storm ... is brewing and headed our way. It will bring with it enormous financial pain. It will threaten public safety. It will make fighting the pandemic that much harder. And it will set back our nation's economic recovery,"" said Sen. Menendez. ""If the Senate fails to respond to this looming crisis, Americans will needlessly suffer, families will be displaced, personal fortunes will be wiped out, and the scars will run so deep, it could take decades to heal the wounds.""  Sen. Menendez urged his colleagues to pass four separate pieces of legislation aimed at stabilizing the housing market and ensuring residents can remain safe and secure in their homes.  This week, he introduced the Coronavirus Housing Counseling Improvement Act (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/search?q=housing+counseling&access=p&as_dt=i&as_epq=&as_eq=&as_lq=&as_occt=any&as_oq=&as_q=&as_sitesearch=&client=wyden&sntsp=0&filter=0&getfields=&lr=&num=15&numgm=3&oe=UTF8&output=xml_no_dtd&partialfields=&proxycustom=&proxyreload=0&proxystylesheet=default_frontend&requiredfields=&sitesearch=&sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&start=0&ud=1) to expand access to critical information, assistance programs and services for millions of families struggling to remain in their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout. According to research, homeowners who receive counseling have a better chance at avoiding default, protecting their credit scores, reducing debt and securing mortgage modifications.  Sen. Menendez announced that he will introduce a separate bill, the Emergency Housing Assistance for Older Adults Act, which would provide $1.2 billion for two key HUD housing assistance programs in order to ensure that federally-assisted senior housing facilities have the necessary resources to effectively protect residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

BlackRock has inked its biggest technology partnership yet, aiming to help Americans save for retirement.  The firm is working with Microsoft to build a platform for retirement savings that will launch next year, the world's largest asset manager said Thursday. Spokespeople for Microsoft and BlackRock declined further comment.  The product, which will be offered through employers, is still under development, a source with knowledge of the platform said. It's designed to be user-friendly, with a goal of being as intuitive as ride-hailing application Uber.  The idea stemmed from a conversation earlier this year between BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which the executives discussed creative ways for companies to address America's retirement crisis. Last year, Fink called the problems associated with longevity ""one of the greatest financial challenges faced by our clients today.""  About 40% of Americans said they are not confident they will have enough money in retirement, according to a Wells Fargo survey last month.  BlackRock currently oversees about $1 trillion in defined contribution assets, out of $6.4 trillion total assets under management. The firm is eyeing growth in the space as more private and public employers move away from pricier pensions to cheaper definied contribution plans, in which employees contribute a portion of their paycheck toward retirement.  BlackRock and Microsoft's product will first be available in the US before potentially rolling out to other regions. Through the platform, BlackRock plans to offer new investment options, such as annuities, which provide a regular stream of income in retirement.

43,Canada pension fund investment into US detention firm larger than reported,"World news Canada pension fund investment into US detention firm larger than reported CPPIB holds $6.1m in investments in Geo Group, a firm that runs US detention facilities under Trump's immigration crackdown  A controversial investment by one of Canada's biggest pension funds in a company which operates private prisons in the United States is larger than initially thought, recent securities filings have revealed.  The Guardian and Documented  reported last month that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) - which manages $366.6bn in pension funds on behalf of some 20 million Canadian retirees - holds stock in Geo Group.  But the most recent regulatory filings show the CPPIB has added to its holdings in Geo Group by 90,000 shares since June - an increase of nearly 50% - bringing the total investment value to $6.1m. It is not known if the fund still holds the shares; the investment board did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Facilities operated by Geo Group have been used in recent months to detain families in the United States, following Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" crackdown on immigration by the American government.  Meanwhile, the CPPIB decreased its holdings of CoreCivic, another private prison company, by 5,900 shares, valuing the investment at $1.65m at the time of filing.  The CPPIB is one of the largest funds in the world, and although the investments in American private prisons companies represent a narrow slice of the overall fund, they have prompted an angry reaction from campaign groups and politicians.  ""I'm very surprised to hear that number is significantly higher than we had previously thought,"" said Emma Pullman of SumOfUs, an advocacy group that started one of two online , an advocacy group that started one of two petitions     calling on the fund to divest its holdings. Between them, the two petitions have received more than 45,000 signatures.  Selling the investment would mark a significant move for the CPPIB, which prides itself in resisting external lobbying attempts.  But public outcry appears to have rattled the board. On 14 November, the board convened a meeting with activists from two separate groups, both petitioning the investment board to divest its holdings.  ""I think the reason they're looking into these options is because the writing is on the wall,"" said Logan McIntosh, a campaigner with the Leadnow advocacy group, who attended the meeting. ""It's an unnecessary and shameful investment and it's undermining the confidence of Canadians that they can manage our retirement savings responsibly.""  Every two years, the CPPIB hosts legally mandated presentations across the country to outline its investment strategy and allow the public to ask questions.  ""I don't think Canadians are interested in profiting from the abuse of humans and the caging of children,"" said Darcie Lanthier, a former financial advisor who attended one such event in Charlottetown.

51,Equity release: read these top tips before you borrow against your home,"Banking Equity release: read these top tips before you borrow against your home Equity release is becoming more popular among older homeowners. It allows those aged 55 or more to borrow a lump sum against the value of their home, with interest payments normally deferred until the house is sold when the owner dies or goes into care.  There are various reasons why equity release might be attractive to homeowners: they may want cash to help a grandchild buy a home, for example, or may need to supplement their own pension income - there are versions of equity release that allow you to make regular withdrawals.  If you do withdraw a lump sum, you can choose to make interest payments so that the sum repayable does not grow; if you allow interest to roll up instead, the amount borrowed can become very large should you live a long time, although equity release plans come with a ""no negative equity"" guarantee.  There are several crucial things to consider before you choose equity release.  Nigel Waterson, chairman of the Equity Release Council, the industry body, said: ""For anyone considering taking out an equity release plan, there are a number of things to consider.  ""First and foremost, it is important that you speak with a qualified adviser who belongs to the Equity Release Council. They will be able to provide you with professional guidance and will ensure that you are able to consider all your options.""  Here are ten top tips to consider:  * Do some research. Unbiased information can be found via the Money Advice Service Guide to Retirement and at equityreleasecouncil.com .  * Consider all your options. Make sure all state benefits are claimed and think about downsizing, renting out a room or asking for help from your family.  * If you take out an equity release plan to pay off an interest-only mortgage, speak with your existing lender to discuss all the options they can offer.  * Discuss your plans with family. They may be able to help or support your decision to take equity release.  * Compile a budget planner to work out what your income requirements are and how they might change over the years.  * If equity release is needed for home improvements, check to see if the local authority offers any grants for the work required.  * Don't take for granted what others tell you about equity release but make sure you speak with a qualified adviser who is a member of the Equity Release Council.  * In addition, take independent legal advice.  * Consider the type of equity release you need. An adviser will help you understand the difference between home reversion plans (where ownership is transferred to the lender at the outset), lifetime mortgages and the different types of plan.  * Don't assume that the lowest interest rate is the best. The plans have various features, some of which may be more suitable. For instance, some allow you to make monthly repayments to avoid the interest rolling up.

52,Getting a loan is all about risk,"Getting a loan is all about risk IF YOU are thinking about applying for a home loan, it's important to gain an understanding of what the banks and lenders look for in the approval process.  The lender will assess your financial position and ability to service the loan, and based on the level of risk that you impose on them, will make a decision on how much or how little they are prepared to lend you, says Loan Market.  Let's look at some of the important key measures used by lenders to help assess your risk.  Income  Your current income will be used to determine the amount of money you can borrow.  Earning a higher income could suggest that you are able to better service your home loan.  But it's not just about what you earn - the lender will also look at your employment history and tenure.  In addition, they will assess your employment status (i.e. full-time, part-time, casual, permanent) to better understand your position.  In the case of self-employed applicants, the process may require more work and further lender scrutiny as the risk is usually higher.  Credit history  Your credit history gives the lender an indication of how you conduct your debts.  Having a clean credit history can increase your chances of borrowing a higher amount because it demonstrates that you are a responsible borrower.  You can request a copy of your credit file to ensure there isn't a black mark against your name.  The last thing you want is to be knocked back by your lender because of a telco default you incurred a few years ago.  In Australia, you can obtain your credit report from VEDA for free.  Deposit amount  The larger the amount you have for a deposit, the less risk the lender is taking when lending to you.  Having regular and consistent deposits made into your bank account will show the lender your ability to save despite having other current expenses.  Debts  Having debts can also determine your borrowing eligibility.  If you have any outstanding debts such as credit cards or personal loans, it would be beneficial to have them paid off before applying for a home loan.  If you have multiple debts, combining them into one could also help to reduce your repayments, which will look more favourable to the lender.  The lender will assess how much money you have left over (after paying your debts) and determine whether you will still be able to afford paying a mortgage.  A mortgage broker plays a key role when you're looking for home loan approval.  You can speak to them about the best way to position yourself to maximise your chances of having your home loan approved.  If you're looking to roll your debts into one, a mortgage broker can talk to you about your options when it comes to a consolidation loan.  This can not only reduce your monthly repayments but can also get you a lower interest rate.",1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

""We talk about all aspects of what participants will need in retirement,"" says Michael Woomer, senior vice president of institutional and retirement plan services at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""People basically understand they will be facing health care costs, but they don't understand how big the impact will be, so we tell participants how important it is to save as much as they can.""  A recent report from the National Association of Government Defined Contribution (DC) Administrators estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring today should expect to spend $220,000 on health care over the course of a 20-year retirement. Woomer says the costs could range from $150,000 to $400,000.  It is far more important for plan advisers to discuss health care costs in retirement than it is to talk about lifestyle goals, says Mary McDougall, a Merrill Lynch financial adviser in St. Paul, Minnesota. The premiums and out-of-pocket expenses will range from $10,000 to $20,000 a year, she says. ""The expenses are a lot more than they expect.""  ""I would hope that advisers are not refraining from having this conversation,"" says Scott Laue, a financial adviser with Savant Capital Management in Rockford, Illinois. ""As a certified financial planner [CFP], we are required to disclose both the good and the bad.""  The trend toward high-deductible health care plans paired with health savings accounts (HSAs) is bringing the subject of health care costs-pre- and post-retirement-to the fore, says Shelby George, vice president, adviser services, at Manning & Napier in Rochester, New York. Just like the movement from pensions to defined contribution plans, employers are moving toward high-deductible plans, which put more of the onus on participants, and ""are encouraging advisers to talk about [those coming expenses] more in their education materials.""  Advisers are also increasingly encouraging participants to invest in HSAs. ""This is one area that participants can use to save above and beyond the retirement plan,"" Woomer says.  Even for participants with more than $5 million in liquid assets-the market advised by Frank Migliazzo, managing director, private wealth advisers at Merrill Lynch in Troy, Michigan-health care costs are a concern. Migliazzo notes that Merrill Lynch research has found that, over the last 30 years, health care costs have risen an average of 6 percentage points above inflation each year.  Merrill Lynch has also found that many people will end up in a nursing home, he adds. For 65-year-olds, there is a 15% chance they will need to be placed in a care facility. At age 85, that possibility rises to 55%, and at age 90, it increases to 70%. Migliazzo's clients are also worried about dementia. As a result, many are buying long-term-care insurance.  The report found that Medicare covers 62% of health care costs, but the individual is responsible for the remaining 38%.",1,1.0,0.0,1.0,1.0

76,New house sales build,"Property New house sales build Signs of growth in new housing sales have emerged in NSW and Western Australia, the states with the biggest house price gains.  Nationally, new housing sales rose 3.4 per cent after a 4.7 per cent decrease in July, the Housing Industry Association's seasonally adjusted figures, released on Tuesday, show.  However, new apartment sales fell 11.2 per cent across the country after new units sales eased in NSW and Victoria.  ""It is no coincidence that the states where we've seen rises in new detached house sales are where we've seen the most price growth,"" HIA chief economist Harley Dale said.  New home sales were up 10.2 per cent in August for Western Australia and 7.4 per cent in NSW. South Australia also performed strongly, recording an 8.2 per cent increase.  Dr Dale said recovery was under way in those two states but overall sales were trending sideways when Sydney and Perth were not included in the figures.  In Queensland, where new house sales inched up at 3.6 per cent, a housing recovery will not be as rapid.  ""It will be challenging and take time to gather momentum; it will be a grinding recovery in Queensland,"" he said.  In Victoria, new house sales fell 2.4 per cent.  Dr Dale said he expected further declines this financial year, as the state was still coming off peak growth in new home and apartment sales in 2010.  Improvements in Sydney have been seen in the housing and apartment market. However, there were fewer new unit sales in August.  Across the industry, builders and developers have noted an overall improvement in sentiment and inquiry levels.  Home builder Metricon chief executive Mario Biasin said sales had improved in NSW, Queensland and South Australia but off very low bases.High demand expected to continue  He said regional Victoria was performing well but metropolitan Melbourne remained quiet.  ""We're seeing more investors than first-home buyers at the moment, and people wanting to upgrade. More people are building now that they feel confident in selling their existing home,"" he said.  Years of under-supply in Sydney's land market, coupled with strong population growth and low interest rates, are fuelling the market.  Cameron Holt, chief executive of Investa's house and land arm, said the biggest challenge was maintaining the supply to the hungry Sydney market.  The unlisted land development arm of Investa Property Group has reported an increase in demand, particularly on Sydney's fringe.  Mr Holt said demand had been high over the past six months, and he expected that to continue.  Medium and high-density projects continue to sell strongly in Sydney, such as Australand's Metro project at Wolli Creek, where 55 of the 70 apartments sold at the September launch.  CBA economists said while low interest rates are not showing up in retail trade data, the housing figures suggest lower rates are having a significant effect on the housing market.",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
77,Bonds Gain As Shutdown Intensifies Debt-Ceiling Fears -- Barron's Blog,"Bonds Gain As Shutdown Intensifies Debt-Ceiling Fears -- Barron's Blog (This story has been posted on Barron's Online's Income Investing blog at http://blogs.barrons.com/incomeinvesting/)  By Michael Aneiro  Financial markets seemed cool with the whole government-shutdown thing yesterday but they're not so happy about it today, and that's pushing bonds higher. The ten-year Treasury note is up 14/32 in price to yield 2.594%, per Tradeweb data, and the 30-year bond is up 26/32 to yield 3.674%.  Of course, what everyone's really worried about is the upcoming debt-ceiling negotiations, and whether the government can patch up its current, comparatively minor problems in time to address this much bigger potential problem of causing the U.S. to default on its debt. Here's Deutsche Bank today:  On balance we expect moderate risk-off dynamics until resolution of both the budget impasse and the debt ceiling. The probability of even a technical default is extremely low, but the potential costs are very high. But in either event we expect the uncertainty to provide a short term tailwind to a consolidation of the summer's sell-off. We remain comfortable with our year end forecast for 2.5% Treasuries, but a more acute scare in the budget and debt ceiling process could push yields still lower in the short run.  And here's Peter Tchir of TF Market Advisors, underscoring what a calamity the debt-ceiling debacle would become if it led to a U.S. default by saying that it ain't gonna happen:  There will NOT be a default on U.S. Treasury debt. It won't happen because it has the potential to spin out of control. Even something that is ""technical"" and ""temporary"" could have ramifications for the market that no one will be willing to risk....  No matter what, we will pay our debts. Whether congress roles it weekly for a period of time, or we get a bigger solution, or the Treasury finds a way to pay people what is owed, the debt will be paid.  The potential consequences of not paying it are too great. It isn't simple and at some point the majority of politicians will listen to people like Bill Gross and understand that the dangers of not paying are just too stupid to take. The system is too complex and at its heart is the understanding that treasuries are highly rated and always pay. Breaking that taboo opens too many possible scenarios for no good reason. This is after all debt and payment obligations that we have encumbered ourselves with through law, and should be paid.  I would never bet against the incompetence of Congress, but I am willing to bet against them being completely idiotic and acting with gross negligence, which is what it would take to trigger default on Treasury bonds.

79,FEAR FOR ELDERLY WITH MORTGAGE DEBT,"FEAR FOR ELDERLY WITH MORTGAGE DEBT Fears have been raised for elderly people who are still sitting on large amounts of mortgage debt and could be at risk of losing their homes.  A report by Bristol University and the International Longevity Centre (ILC-UK) found that about two-fifths (40%) of people aged 75 and over and who still have a mortgage to pay off have an interest only mortgage with no linked investment with which to pay their loan back. This figure dropped to just 6% for people aged between 50 and 54 who still have a mortgage.  Interest-only mortgages, which allow borrowers to pay off the capital only when the mortgage term ends, have become much more thin on the ground since the boom years amid concerns about people not being able to pay back their debt.  Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that home owners have been failing to put enough money aside on up to half of the 2.6 million interest-only mortgages which are due for repayment over the next 30 years.  Mortgage lenders recently agreed to alert their most at-risk customers to help them avoid ""payment shocks''. Some borrowers could end up having to sell their home to pay the loan back if they do not take stronger control of their repayment planning.  The Bristol University/ILC-UK research found that nearly one in 10 (9%) households headed by someone aged in their late 60s still had a mortgage to pay off, as did one in 50 (2%) of people aged over 80.  Among everyone aged over 50 with an outstanding mortgage, the average amount still owed was £62,200. Among the over 75s, the average amount outstanding was £30,900.  At least 14% of older mortgaged households had taken on a new home loan or extended their mortgage in the last couple of years, the report found.  The research was based on the Office for National Statistics' Wealth and Assets Survey, which looked at the economic wellbeing of households.  Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange Debt Charity, said: ""Today's report further highlights the potentially serious problems faced by older people with interest only mortgages.  ""It is now essential that lenders show forbearance and work with customers to establish suitable options to prevent people from losing their homes in retirement.""  Andrea Finney of Bristol University's Personal Finance Research Centre, said: ""These new findings highlight a core of households whose mortgages have persisted into older age.""  She said the report raises important questions about the financial security of these households as they approach later life.  David Sinclair, assistant director of policy and communications at ILC-UK said: ""We are seeing a worrying picture emerge of older people with unlinked interest only mortgages.  ""As the FCA and industry communicates with people with unlinked interest only mortgages, it should evaluate whether any specific targeting of information and advice is necessary for older people.""  ends",1,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0
81,A fund of one,"A fund of one How one US pension plan is revising the definition of a 'commingled' fund to speed up investment  Finding ways of investing faster appears to be rife among US pension plans at the minute. Note last month's procedural shift by the Nebraska Investment Council, which removed the need for board approval for certain repeat commitments. The reasoning for the expedited process was to better enable the pension system to invest in vehicles prior to the first close, when better fees and terms are sometimes offered. If you ever wanted an indicator of how hot the US real estate market has become, measures likes these are surely one.  In addition, since the Nebraska case came to light, another one has cropped up. As PERE reported this week, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) has made a $100 million commitment to CityView Bay Area II.  This might seem like a run-of-the-mill commitment to a commingled fund. Indeed, that is what LACERA calls it. However, upon closer inspection, it much more closely resembles a separate account. There is only one limited partner, LACERA, and the pension plan has complete control over areas such as general partner termination, fund extensions and cessation of investment period. It also has retained the right to own the projects outright upon completion as long-term core assets and already has drawn up a true separate account management agreement with CityView to be used if and when it acquires full interests.  So, why hasn't LACERA just committed to a separate account rather than what it technically defines as commingled fund? The answer is the need for speed.  If LACERA had made this commitment as a separate account, it would first have had to go through a time-consuming request for proposal (RFP) process that typically requires six to nine months to complete. However, it doesn't want to miss out on opportunities now.  Still, there is no 'legal' definition for what constitutes a commingled fund. In addition, unlike some investors, LACERA does not have a limit on the percentage of a commingled fund that its investment can represent.  It's also important to note that not all state pension plans are subject to RFP processes for separate account managers or other real estate hires One large public pension that PERE spoke with has made its multiple separate account manager hires without putting mandates out for public bid. For LACERA, the need to engage in an RFP process becomes an additional hurdle and potentially puts it at a competitive disadvantage. This unique fund structure is one way for the pension plan to level the playing field without breaking the rules.  Of course, not all pension funds in the US will be following suit in finding ways to expedite the investment process. However, with the US market appearing so hot right now and investors not wishing to be too late to opportunities, one can expect more pension plans to find ways to be more nimble.",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
84,Certified COBRA Administrator COBRAGuard Inc. Awarded Contract with State of North Carolina,"Certified COBRA Administrator COBRAGuard Inc. Awarded Contract with State of North Carolina OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Sept. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- After a transparent and highly competitive bid process, the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees awarded benefits administration contracts to five companies, including Kansas City-based COBRAGuard. The state provides benefits for approximately 664,000 people. With this decision, it expects to save $22.4 million, roughly 19 percent, compared to last year.  COBRAGuard will take over as the state's new COBRA administration partner effective July 1, 2013, and will serve for a contracted term of three and a half years. The company will provide a full range of COBRA administration and direct billing services. The contract is valued at approximately $1.2 million annually.  ""We are delighted to be chosen as North Carolina's COBRA administration partner,"" COBRAGuard President Robert Meyers said. ""Our goal is to help the state save time and operate efficiently, while delivering exceptional service and secure online account access for COBRA participants. The state was able to drive down costs by splitting the administration contract between several highly efficient, niche-focused companies. Other public entities should consider North Carolina's innovative strategy.""  COBRAGuard has a long history of successfully serving public entities. The company serves more than 1,000 cities, counties, municipalities, school districts and universities across the nation, with the addition of North Carolina. In 2011, the company announced the formation of a public entity division. Meyers serves as a councilman for the city of Roeland Park, Kan., so he has firsthand understanding of public entity challenges and a unique desire to help them thrive. ""At COBRAGuard, we don't see ourselves as vendors,"" Meyers said. ""We are highly engaged and adaptable problem solvers who extend the capabilities of the organizations we serve.""  Outsourcing benefit management is becoming more common, said Jan White, president of the Society for Human Resource Management of Greater Kansas City. White also is HR director for the Visiting Nurse Association of Kansas City. ""COBRA is just one of those regulations that a lot of people find cumbersome to manage, and if you can outsource it, that frees you up for other tasks,"" White said in the September 7 edition of the Kansas City Business Journal.  ""Public and private organizations understand that it's inefficient to continuously invest in the training, legal review and documentation needed to properly administer COBRA,"" Meyers said. ""It's considerably more cost-effective to outsource COBRA administration to experts -- particularly now that we're operating in the age of health care reform with a constantly evolving landscape.""

85,"California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform","News; News California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a hotly contested pension reform bill whose impact on public employees may signal a new era in DB and health care coverage nationwide.  Reuters notes that Brown's new legislation will raise the minimum retirement ages for many public employees as well as reducing pension benefits for all new workers.  ""Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system,"" Brown said, in a statement. The law, he adds, is the ""biggest rollback to public pensions in the history of California pensions.""  California's new rules come admit tremendous economic and political pressure to curtail the escalating costs of DB plans and post-retirement benefits for public employees, both in that state and across the U.S.  But California's pressures have been stronger, with several major cities claiming or teetering on the verge of bankrupcy as they find it impossible to meet their pension obligations, in part due to long-term national economic issues.  The state's two biggest pension funds, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, are at least $165 million underfunded.  And normally left-leaning, worker-friendly cities including San Jose and San Diego have also joined the fray, with voters supporting measures to limit pension benefits for existing workers and retirees and drastically reduce services to new hires - votes which are being contested in court by public safety employee unions.  Under Brown's new legistlation, new hires will evenly split payments to their pension accounts with their employers, and other government employers will have more leverage to ask the same of current employees, upping their required contributions. Park rangers, game wardens and firefighters will now have to pay more of their own benefits.  The legislation also launches new formulas for calculating future pension benefits for new employees.  As a spin-off to the pension legislation, Moody's Investors Service said the action will go far to increasing California's overall credit rating, currently listed as A1.  The Associated Press notes that the bill did not include a hybrid-styled system Brown had championed which would add a 401(k)-style system so public employees would bear some of the investment risk, as private-sector workers do.  As well, nothing was done to contain the health care costs promised to retiring workers, and there are still no indendent members with financial experties on the board of the state's main pension fund.  ""Yes, it's not everything. It's not perfection,"" Brown told reporters in Los Angeles. ""But in politics we don't deal with perfection. These are hard fought. These aren't that easy.""  California's public employees' system estimates the changes will save between $42 billion and $50 billion over 30 years, while the teachers' system estimated its savings at $22.7 billion over 30 years.",1,0.0,1.0,1.0,1.0
87,Grown-Up Spring Break Spots,"Spending Grown-Up Spring Break Spots Plane tickets might cost more this year, but if you're flexible on days (and not too picky about destinations), there are both spring break hotel bargains to be had - and strategies to avoid partying college students.  Airfare for between Feb. 28 and March 31 is up 9% this spring, to an average of $349, while hotels are down 15%, reports Bing Travel, Microsoft's travel search site. What does that mean for you? Think: travel jujitsu. ""College students tend to go to the same places every year -- Cancun, Palm Springs, South Beach,"" says Erik Torkells, the editor of travel review site TripAdvisor.com. ""They like to stay where all the action is."" For grown-ups, that might mean considering the Big Apple, where vacancies have brought down the prices on three and four star properties. Or a more family-oriented area, like Orlando. If you're really set on the beach, you could have to shell out for a high-end resort students can't afford, or head for hotels and vacation rentals at smaller towns nearby.  Here are three destinations for a bargain Spring Break:  1) Hawaii  Putting aside the recent tsunami scare, Hawaii is still a budget-buster for most college students because of the long-haul flight. But with peak travel season extending through April, there will be bargains - and crowds, says Barbara Messing, the vice president for deal-tracking site Travel-Ticker.com. Outrigger and Ohana resorts, which operate 23 properties on four islands, have dropped rates by up to 65% for travel through April 30. Prices for a standard room at the Ohana Waikiki West start at $79 per night. East Coast residents may be priced out, though: Round-trip flights from Los Angeles start at about $500.  2) Orlando  College students take over many of Florida's beaches, but the theme parks remain the domain of families, says Ian Ford, the founder of travel deal site UndercoverTourist.com. If you can avoid traveling in late March, early April over Easter weekend, there are deals on park properties, too. Disneycut room prices by 25% to 40% through March 27, and then starting up again April 11. You'll pay as little as $79 for a standard room. Round-trip flights from New York start at $175.  3) New York  New York came in third on student travel site StudentUniverse.com's tally of top spring break destinations, based on the number of flights booked. Tourists are unlikely to notice the influx, however, Torkells says. ""If students come to New York, the city absorbs them,"" he says. ""There isn't critical mass."" Expedia.com currently has discounts ranging from 20% to 40% on three- and four-star New York properties. A deluxe king room at The Alex costs as little as $209 per night instead of $349 (a 40% discount), while a superior king room at the Park Central New York Hotel is $179 instead of $239 (25%).",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

95,Don't be too late,"Don't be too late FINANCIAL security is the most common factor when it comes to deciding about when to retire, according to research released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the current financial year.  ``But the problem is, without professional retirement planning advice, it's near impossible for most people to know if they're financially secure enough to provide for the retirement they  want,'' says John Newcomb, from RetireInvest Robina.  While their retirement lump sum is likely to be the biggest sum of money they've ever had, and may seem like a fortune, when the impact of tax and inflation is considered - and the fact the money might have to last for a retirement of up to 20 years plus - the amount might not end up stretching far at all.  ``It's important to think in advance about what sort of lifestyle you're expecting in retirement and consider the costs.''  While the government age pension may offer some support, and should be maximised through every reasonable way, it's not something to aspire to of itself.  In the quarter to September, 2007, the cost of living increased to $48,000 a year for retired couples with a lifestyle that included a broad range of leisure activities, private health insurance, a reasonable car, good clothes, and occasional international travel, according to Westpac/Association of Superannuation Funds research.  For those leading a more modest retirement lifestyle, better than the age pension but still fairly basic, the yearly cost was $26,300.  ``With life expectance increasing, it's even more important to ensure your retirement finances are well-planned so you don't outlive your money,'' says John.  When it comes to retiring, there are complex rules around tax, social security, investments and superannuation and  so many ways to structure finances.  ``If Australians only seek financial advice once in their life, planning for retirement is the time to do it and the earlier they seek advice, the more options they'll have,'' says John.  Professional financial advisers can help people identify what sort of retirement lifestyle they want and how to structure their resources to make the most of tax and social security rules and ensure they have a reliable income.  They can provide advice about how and where retirement savings should be put, how to get the most from superannuation and when to retire, as well as how to plan your estate so it's distributed to who you want in the most effective manner.  ``You only have one life so make the most of your retirement with help from a financial adviser,'' says John.

97,Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals,"Guardian Financial Pages Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals Abbey today become the first major high street lender to clamp down on low-cost ""interest-only"" mortgages by reducing the maximum loan for such deals to as little as 50% of the property's value.  Growing numbers of borrowers have turned to interest-only loans as a way of affording high property prices. Customers pay interest but none of the capital debt.  In late 2006 the Financial Services Authority warned that thousands of homebuyers taking out these mortgages could be putting themselves at risk of repossession because they have little or no idea how they will pay back the loan.  Abbey said interest-only borrowers with ""a proven repayment vehicle in place"" would be able to borrow up to 75% of a property's value, down from 85%. Those who cannot produce evidence of a repayment vehicle will be limited to 50%. ""This reduces the risk to both the customer and to Abbey, and is prudent given ongoing market conditions,"" a bank spokesman said.  Nationwide yesterday increased the minimum deposit it demands from new borrowers to 10% on all but two of its mortgage products. Britain's biggest building society also halved its maximum loan to pounds 500,000, little more than two weeks after reducing it to pounds 1m.  Nationwide is the latest in a line of banks and building societies to rein in lending in response to the credit crunch. On Saturday Halifax increased some of its fixed and tracker mortgage rates by up to 0.6 of a percentage point.  Nationwide is reducing its maximum loan-to-value ratio from 95% to 90% on all products for new borrowers except its three-year fixed-rate mortgage and three- year tracker, both available to people looking to borrow 95% of a property's value.  Its move will fuel concern that 95% mortgages are under threat; Cheltenham & Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester and Britannia are among other lenders to have capped their maximum loans at 90%.  Halifax is one of the few lenders that still offers mortgages up to 95%, though it charges a higher rate for such loans.  Nationwide also said new customers wanting to take out its standard variable-rate deal, which it calls its ""base mortgage rate"", will need a deposit of at least 25%, and that this deal will be available only to customers dealing directly with it. It described the moves, which take effect from May 1, as ""part of its ongoing approach of managing business in a prudent and sustainable way"".  Sean Gardner, at personal finance website MoneyExpert.com, said the biggest struggle for buyers now was not being able to afford a mortgage but getting one. ""If you've not got a substantial deposit or equity in your house, then your choices are now severely limited. On average, if you are remortgaging you now need a deposit of 15.5% if you take out a fixed or variable mortgage.""",0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0
104,COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes,"COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes     Until lenders offer get out clauses so clients can switch out of 10- year fixed mortgages, longer term deals will remain a tough sell in terms of best advice, says Sally Laker      A couple of decades ago I would have given my right arm to have been able to fix my mortgage at 8%, let alone 5%. If it had been a 10-year deal even better. Why? Because interest rates were at 14%.      Luckily Bank of Scotland came to the rescue with what was called a stabiliser mortgage and this helped many a borrower survive. With this deal, the client agreed with the lender what rate they would pay. If interest rates went down they owed less and if they went up they owed more. An adjustment was then made to the loan after three years.      So what has all this got to do with fixed rates in today's marketplace? Well, it's a sign of the times. As I have mentioned, back in the late 1980s we would have done anything for a fixed rate and 8% would have been a steal but now things have changed so much that even a 10-year fixed rate at 4.99% will not necessarily fly out the door.      It seems crazy but we have become a nation of short-term fixers. We want two or three-year deals because we are ever optimistic that after two or three years the rates will be even lower. In reality this is unlikely to happen nowadays, but there will be a rate there or thereabouts.      So why not fix for longer and save switching every two years in hope of a better deal? In the case of best advice, it is a tough call to recommend a 10-year deal and effectively be sure that fix will be good for 10 years as well as proving that the client wouldn't be better off checking and switching every two years. Who can predict for certain that interest rates won't change much in 10 years, up or down?      Unless lenders can offer the equivalent of break clauses or get out clauses that allow borrowers to switch out of their fixes to other products during that 10-year period, longer term deals will be difficult to sell.      Nobody will want to pay hefty redemption penalties to switch even if it is to a more attractive product. Again, it is possible that many won't switch, but not having the option is a deterrent to even considering it.      We have become a nation of switchers. We switch credit cards, car insurance, house insurance - and now mortgages are seen as an extension of that.      This is all great news for brokers as it is their business to look after their clients and check their mortgages fit their requirements. And we know that those requirements can change in a two-year period - you only have to ask Tony Blair about that.",0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0
110,"Planner: Turn portfolio to more conservative path ; Without a secure job, it's important to tone down risk","MONEY Planner: Turn portfolio to more conservative path ; Without a secure job, it's important to tone down risk  Stacy Kopper has done two things very well, says Janet Briaud, a financial planner in Bryan, Texas.   ""She has developed a really nice portfolio for her age and kept her spending way down in this uncertain time,"" Briaud says.   The main thing Kopper needs to do, she says, is tone down the risk in her portfolio. ""If you don't have a secure job, then you want your portfolio to be more secure and safe.""   Given that Kopper plans to continue working into retirement age, as long as her investment assets grow a little bit, she doesn't need to take a lot of risk. Another reason to err on the side of caution is that stock valuations are high now.   ""It's just a time for Stacy especially to be pretty conservative,"" Briaud says.   To accomplish that, Briaud suggests that Kopper:   * Invest the IRA accounts in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). ""They are very safe and secure investments that I think are underutilized,"" Briaud says. ""They are tax inefficient, so you want them in a retirement account.""   * Divide the roughly 30% of her assets now in the non-retirement portfolio among three mutual funds. Because the market is overvalued, Briaud recommends a mix of value-oriented funds and funds with a hedging strategy to help protect against volatility.   Specifically, she recommends a small-cap value fund, such as Oakmark Small Cap, and an international value fund, such as Tweedy Browne Global Value or Longleaf Partners International.   Briaud's third stock fund recommendation is Hussman Strategic Growth, which invests in U.S. stocks with the goal of preserving capital during unfavorable market conditions.   * Maintain her current cash position. ""She's got about 20% in cash, and I think that's appropriate,"" Briaud says.   * Put about 20% of her portfolio in a laddered portfolio of short- term Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from one to three years. That money could later be used for a down payment on a home.   * Invest another 10% in an international bond fund, such as Pimco Global. ""I think eventually the dollar will come down, and another 10% in an international bond fund would help in that environment,"" she says.   Kopper should focus on getting the job she wants and making her portfolio more conservative. Once she's done those two things, she can begin to think about buying a home.   For the moment, she is lucky not to own a home, Briaud says. Home prices are high, and not owning a home gives her more flexibility in her job hunt.   The fact that Kopper's expenses are low and she has accumulated sizable savings gives her unusual freedom to make major changes. ""Her biggest asset is ability to earn,"" Briaud says.

(HPC) expects capital  expenditures in 2005 to be $70 million to $75 million, according to its  annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.            As reported, the maker of chemical specialties said 2004 capital  expenditures are seen at $65 million to $70 million.            In the 10-K from late Monday, Hercules said capital expenditures are  expected to be about $60 million in the years 2006 through 2008.         [ 03-16-04 0859ET ]                 According to the 10-K, Hercules projects asbestos settlement payments  of $40 million to $45 million in 2004 before consideration of any insurance  coverage or reimbursement.            Net of insurance, Hercules spent $40 million during 2003, the filing  said.            Hercules said it expects severance payments of $10 million in 2004.  Restructuring and severance payments were $21 million in 2003 versus $39  million in 2002, according to the 10-K.            Hercules also said it expects remaining tax payments from its  BetzDearborn divestiture to be between $11 million and $21 million, and  expects to pay them in 2005.            In April 2002, Hercules completed the sale of its BetzDearborn water  treatment business for $1.8 billion in cash, resulting in net after-tax  proceeds of $1.7 billion.            In 2003, Hercules paid $15 million in taxes related to the  divestiture.         [ 03-16-04 0926ET ]                 Hercules said in the filing that it expects pension and  postretirement benefit plan expenses of $58 million for 2004, $73 million for  2005 and $63 million for 2006.            The company said it made contributions of $55 million to its defined  benefits pensions plans in 2003.            Hercules said the projected increase in pension expense in 2004, 2005  and 2006 is because of the decline in interest rates and the unfavorable  performance of the company's pension investment portfolio from 2000 to 2002.            Hercules said a projected decrease in pension expense in 2006 versus  2005 results from favorable investment performance in 2003.            As previously disclosed, Hercules said it expects making voluntary  cash contributions of $40 million a year to its benefit plan over the next  few years.            Hercules said in the 10-K it contributed $40 million to its U.S.  benefit plan in January and $7 million to its non-U.S. pension plans in the  fourth quarter of 2003.         [ 03-16-04 1003ET ]                 In the 10-K, Hercules also disclosed that it repurchased 46,000 of  its CRESTS Units for $34 million in the fourth quarter, of which $27 million  was the units' preferred security component and $7 million its warrants  component.            Also in the fourth quarter, Hercules purchased $24 million of its  11.125% senior notes, recognizing a loss of $5 million.            Hercules said it also repurchased an additional $33 million of the  senior notes in 2004 at a cost of $40 million.    -By Brian Callaghan; Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1352;  brian.callaghan@dowjones.com       [ 03-16-04 1012ET ]",0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

The question is fundamental to judging the cost effectiveness of government and the necessity of the polarizing Act 10, in which Gov. Scott Walker instituted dramatic benefit cuts for unionized public workers to help balance the budget. But scholars disagree substantially on how Wisconsin s public and private workers compare in terms of wages Two recent studies show salaries and benefits for public workers are about percent more than comparable private workers but another study asserts public workers make percent less The key divide is over how to calculate retirement benefits Public employers also have a more compressed pay scale said Charlie Carlson a Middleton labor expert who has done public private compensation comparisons for municipalities across the state He told Gannett Wisconsin Media that local governments typically pay less than private employers to top managers roughly the same to mid level skilled workers and more to those in lower skilled positions But local market factors mean the comparison may vary widely among municipalities And statewide comparisons can t be done on a position by position basis since public sector jobs such as police and firefighters don t have private sector equivalents The solution for academic researchers is a human capital approach in which workers are compared on factors that affect compensation rather than on the specific occupation Some studies include dozens of variables the primary ones being education experience the skill required by a given job and the number of hours worked This doesn t yield results for specific entities that is addressed in a flurry of local studies commissioned after Act But it can show on a statewide basis how public and private workers compare in terms of pay and benefits depending on whom you believe Studies vary on compensation comparison Three recent studies examining pay and benefits use different methods and come to disparate conclusions Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute and Jason Richwine of the Heritage Foundation wrote in a May study for the conservative American Enterprise Institute that state of Wisconsin employees are paid percent more than their private sector counterparts State workers total compensation was about percent higher before Act they said The study showed salaries are roughly equivalent between the public and private sectors but benefits are a different story Even after Act state workers pensions are nearly five times as valuable as those in the private sector and health benefits are about twice as generous A November study from the MacIver Institute a conservative Madison based think tank said Wisconsin s public sector employees received pay and benefits percent above the private sector The study co authored by William Even an economics professor at Miami University in Ohio covers both state and local government employees but does not account for Act changes since it uses data from The two studies contrast sharply with a February study that Jeffrey Keefe conducted for the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington D C Keefe said Wisconsin s state and local public employees received pay and benefits totaling percent less than their private sector counterparts even before Act reduced the value of public benefits The MacIver Institute study differed from the others in not taking into account the size of the employer Larger companies generally pay higher wages and benefits and government entities are relatively large so the studies by Keefe and Biggs compared salaries only to private firms of employees or more Pensions key to study differences The main difference among the three studies arises from disagreement over the value of public pensions Olivia Mitchell executive director of the Pension Research Council at The Wharton School in Pennsylvania said the rate of interest used in the calculations is crucial since the pension plan s cost to taxpayers rises by nearly percent with every percent reduction in the assumed interest rate Most government agencies assume an percent rate of return in determining how much to pay into the pension fund annually to yield the promised payouts at retirement Keefe s study calculated pension value simply on the amount paid in by the employers He said the methodology used in the other two studies is extremely conservative and assumes virtually no return on the pension fund Biggs and Richwine used a rate of return of approximately percent in their calculations which Biggs said is an accurate estimate for a no risk investment and is on par with a government bond rate Public pension amounts are backed by the government and carry no risk to employees unlike a typical private sector retirement plan that has no guaranteed value at retirement Even who did the MacIver Institute study also used a return rate of about percent He said if he assumed an percent rate as Keefe did his study would have shown a percent premium for public workers in Wisconsin instead of percent No one who has a k plan would be correct in assuming they re going to earn percent on their money for the rest of their life Even said You re making a promise that is backed by the faith of the state government so the thinking is you should assume an interest rate that the state should borrow at We assumed a percent rate and if anything I think in today s world that s probably a little

You may soon have the chance to back out of this once-irreversible purchase by jumping into the secondary annuities market. But exercise this freedom with caution; experts say many retirees could regret taking the pensions parachute.
An annuity allows people to get hold of their hard-earned retirement savings in a responsible way. It converts your pension pot into a carefully calculated annual income that should comfortably last the rest of your life However this product available direct from pension providers or online brokers has often been accused of offering poor value for money particularly when bought without financial advice or by people in poor health Critics say it is all too easy to be lulled into uncompetitive rates if you fail to shop around depriving you of income that is particularly precious if do not have long to live Retirees have previously had no ability to trade in annuities or substitute them for a different product That is all changing following George Osborne s pensions revolution of Now the Government is giving people even greater freedoms with plans to establish a secondary annuities market SAM Due to be launched on April next year SAM will enable people to cash in their annuities in exchange for a lump sum to spend or invest how they see fit HMRC is now in the process of ironing out tax implications after launching a consultation predicting that people could take up this option Meanwhile the Financial Conduct Authority has published its own blueprint for SAM but with a warning that sellers could be exposed to significant risks Indeed experts have voiced their own misgivings arguing that SAM could be just as much of a minefield as the first hand annuities industry Tom McPhail head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown says There are still unanswered questions around the regulation of the market and how consumer protection could work we need to make sure investors don t end up getting ripped off by their insurance company for some of them possibly not for the first time Andrew Tully at Retirement Advantage says that customers with very small annuities may find a capital lump sum more appealing than a small monthly income but warns that SAM will be a complicated market He goes on We need to ensure people who currently receive poor value annuities do not think the secondary market is their means of escape Two wrongs will clearly not make it right trading your annuity is not the panacea for the lack of shopping around at retirement So how will SAM work Broadly speaking sellers can hand over their annuities to a third party an authorised broker in return for a lump sum or to buy a flexi access drawdown fund or flexible annuity The requirement to take financial advice is likely to be mandatory above a certain threshold and the customer will have to go through a new underwriting process to check health and lifestyle Mr Tully says The buyer for your annuity will consider your current health and how long they think you will live This may be different to when you originally bought the annuity if your health has since deteriorated and you will probably need to complete a medical questionnaire This will all help the buyer work out how much income they think is left from your annuity and therefore the value they will place on it Of course these things aren t cheap and there will likely be substantial costs for doing a deal He cites the costs for a medical administration possible advice and the need for the buyer to make a profit although commission will not be charged The biggest stumbling block could be tax this is payable on the cash lump sum which will be considered as part of your normal income and calculated at your income tax rate This reduces what you get from the deal and may even push you into the higher tax bracket per cent Indeed the Treasury has estimated it will make million from tax receipts in the first two years of SAM You need to be hard headed about how you will manage your pension if you trade in your annuity The SAM option may be viable if you have other sources of income such as multiple pensions or dividends from your investment portfolio much less so if you are completely reliant on your annuity Plus you cannot go back once you trade in your annuity meaning you have to be certain it is the right deal for you and you may also give up the right to transfer your annuity income to your spouse if you pass away If you do decide to cash in Steven Cameron from Edinburgh based pensions firm Aegon recommends seeking professional advice or at the very least shopping around to get the best deal He also suggests flexible drawdown as a less drastic alternative to a lump sum You can then take an income when you wish and only pay income tax on the amount you take out often cutting your tax bill",0,,,1.0,1.0

The special session is set to begin at p m Thursday If everybody agrees and it goes smoothly it could go Thursday Friday and Saturday Beebe said The governor s call for a special session includes six bills Four will address the rising health insurance costs and one which is backed by the governor and will be considered separately would phase out the excess property tax revenue some school districts have kept and redirect those funds to the state The sixth bill added late Wednesday afternoon would repeal Act of which eased regulatory requirements on municipalities and industries that discharge minerals into Arkansas waterways The proposals to address the teacher insurance crisis includes both a short term and long term solution The short term proposal calls for using million from the state surplus to avert a percent rise in health insurance rates set to go into effect Jan Another million a year would hold down future increases I would not be issuing this call if we hadn t

teachers and other involved parties we have a solution that may not please every individual group but will help alleviate the spike in insurance rates and shore up this insurance program The governor

shy of a supermajority notified the governor early Wednesday they had secured votes two more than the three fourths majority needed in that chamber Sen Johnny Key R Mountain Home chairman of the

to study long term structural reforms of the public employees insurance program Several senators wanted assurances that the task force would be proactive and not fall apart or have its recommendations sit on a shelf Key said The legislative intent is we re not going to have to continue to bail out the system he told reporters Reforms are going to have to take place and if they don t take place this funding stream that we re putting in there we re going to pull those back down the road if we don t adopt real reforms The task force would be required to issue a report and make recommendations by June to be reviewed by legislative committees and all budget issues addressed in time for consideration in the legislative session Key said the panel would conduct a comprehensive review of the state and public school employee insurance systems including governance and structure board structure and funding options Separately lawmakers will consider the phase out of excess property tax revenue held by some districts Beebe said the measure would address a Arkansas Supreme Court ruling and keep the state s school funding in line with the intent of provisions that ended the long running Lake View school funding case As for addressing the school employees insurance crisis Beebe set legislative consensus on both short term and long term solutions as a condition for calling a special session Legislative leaders quickly forged agreement on using surplus funds for the short term fix The long term plan took more time It would redirect million annually to the school employees health insurance system million from general revenue million from the school facilities improvement program and million from state funding for teacher professional development Another million would be passed on to

development that we need more And so I quarrel with that reduction but I would grudgingly hold my nose and probably vote for it The health insurance rates for school employees have been rising for several years because of a lack of funding from the state and local school districts Also a million catastrophic claims fund was wiped out by five claims in and that each totaled more than million The Legislature this year appropriated million for the program In September Bob Alexander director of the Employee Benefits Division told a legislative committee it would take million in new money to keep premium rates at current levels next year As lawmakers considered ways to hold down premium increases officials earlier this month pushed back the enrollment period for employees covered by the health insurance plan from Oct to Nov The health insurance system told the governor it needed some direction by Tuesday so that it could begin preparing material for the sign up period The board met Tuesday and voted to begin the process of printing up materials based on the proposal now being considered by lawmakers In discussing the late addition of the proposal to repeal Act Beebe said that was added because the federal Environmental Protection Agency had complained and said it would begin reviewing all water permits",0,,,1.0,0.0

Such advice is sound, and though retirement is a long way off from the start of one's career, those professionals who heed these words of wisdom and start saving early are bound to benefit down the road.","The virtues of saving for retirement are extolled from the moment young men and women begin their professional careers. Such advice is sound, and though retirement is a long way off from the start of one's career, those professionals who heed these words of wisdom and start saving early are bound to benefit down the road. But even the best advice can fall on deaf ears from time to time and many people simply don t save enough for retirement A survey from Fidelity Investments revealed just how much financial trouble the average American is likely to be in upon retirement The survey asked more than participants a range of questions on topics including their health retirement and saving habits and found that the average baby boomer which includes those born between and was on track to reach just percent of their retirement income needs Those needs include food shelter and medical care The study also found that percent of participants across all generations were saving less than percent of their salaries for retirement That s especially troubling when considering financial planners often advise men and women to save to percent of their salaries for retirement Some simple arithmetic and an examination of assets including retirement accounts and savings can shed light on how rosy or bleak a person s retirement looks Young professionals have time to make up for their indiscretions but men and women over who haven t saved enough for retirement must get to work immediately to ensure their retirement years are comfortable The following are a handful of ways men and women can catch up on retirement savings catch up on retirement savings is to start spending less Men and women over know that the sand in their earnings hourglass is running out and those behind on retirement savings need to make the most of their earnings in the years ahead That means cutting out any unnecessary expenses so that money can be used to save for retirement Examine all of your monthly and annual expenses to find ways to trim some fat You many want to downsize your vehicle to a less expensive and more fuelefficient make and model Golfers can cancel their country club memberships in favor of golfing on more affordable public courses that don t charge hefty annual membership fees Slashing spending won t be easy but doing so is the first step toward catching up on your retirement savings sponsored retirement plan If you have not been contributing the maximum amount to your employer sponsored retirement plan start doing so This is especially beneficial if your employer matches your plans should not drastically affect your take home pay now if the plan is a pre tax plan like a k women over the age of to make annual catch up contributions up to These contributions must be made to a retirement plan via elective deferrals and there are additional requirements as well Men and women over interested in making catch up contributions to their retirement accounts can learn more at www irs gov counts Though it s best to put as much money into tax advantaged accounts if you are already maxing out your contributions to such accounts it s still good to sock away money into a traditional taxable savings account It s unwise to expect your retirement accounts to fully fund your lifestyle in retirement so you will need or at least want a substantial amount of money in savings The benefit here is the money you put into traditional savings accounts has already been taxed so you won t incur any bills from the tax man once you begin to use that money down the road ideal for men and women with a target retirement date in mind postponing the day you call it quits is another way to catch up ment allows you to build a more substantial retirement portfolio while also decreasing the amount of time you will need to rely on that money This gives you more flexibility in retirement In addition Americans who work longer can increase their Social Security benefit because working longer should allow them to delay the day they start taking Social Security payments Men and women who can wait until age to accept such payments will receive larger monthly payments as a result Studies have shown that men and women are simply not saving enough to finance their retirements But there are myriad ways for those over to start catching up",1,,,1.0,1.0

Given an increase in administrative fees, new non-academic buildings and losses of federal and state funding for higher education, this rise in cost is expected to continue.

So how are students supposed to pay for their education, and what risks are associated with this rapidly-expanding market? For many students the answer to that question lies in some form of student loans However the amount of loans currently outstanding is daunting as of January outstanding student debt was at trillion That s billion larger than the outstanding auto loans trillion larger than the level of outstanding credit card debt and equivalent to percent of U S gross domestic product What form do these loans take Unlike with most debt products the majority of student loans are created and held by federal banks Of that trillion dollar market percent is composed of federal student loans The remaining percent comes from a mix of private banks and loan agencies When deciding how to select a student loan the biggest consideration should be given to the interest rate Many private loans have variable rates meaning the interest you pay differs depending on an economic indicator of the loan creator s choosing usually the London Interbank Offered Rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate These indicators are used to determine most of the loan rates around the world and they usually increase with fears around inflation Now this can be highly beneficial if you want to have low interest rates as rates can drop extremely low in certain economic conditions and lead to a cheaper loan payment However the rate can also swing upward and your loan payment can end up being much higher than expected Currently possible interest rates on variable rate private loans range from percent to percent With federal loans a fixed interest rate is used This fixed rate is set by Congress and does not change over the lifetime of the loan This fixed rate is set by taking the yield on a year Treasury note and adding a management fee with the fee being lower for undergraduate borrowers and higher for graduate students and parents Currently the undergraduate rate is set to percent graduate to percent and parents to percent In suit with the private loans the year Treasury note yield also increases with inflationary fear Inflation also affects the real rates of the loans The real rate is the inflation adjusted rate for your loan For example if you had a loan with an interest rate of percent and inflation is percent over the time of repayment then the real rate of your loan is percent This may benefit borrowers with fixed rates as inflation can slowly eat away at interest paid Variable rates however adjust with inflation leading to no real rate benefit So if you re relatively risk averse and want to know how much your loans are going to cost make sure to stick with a federal loan or a private fixed loan Otherwise you could be stuck paying much more than you had expected or planned for if inflation fears rapidly increase chief goon opinion dailytarheel com",1,,,1.0,1.0

Since you've joined the workforce, you might be paying back your loans as best you can. But can you gradually reduce your debts while still putting money away for your long-term goals - such as retirement? Of course you might think it s premature to even think about retiring since you probably have decades to go before you say goodbye to the working world But the sooner you begin saving and investing for retirement the more time you ll have for your money to grow Plus your early start will help you avoid having to play catch up later Still it can be challenging to juggle payments for student loans and contributions to a retirement account especially if your loans are sizable How can you meet these two separate demands on your income To begin with you may have some flexibility in how you repay your student loan Although you might have selected or were assigned a repayment plan when you first begin repaying your student loan you can typically change this plan to accommodate your financial situation You ll need to contact your loan servicer for details on adjusting your repayments In any case though if you have a large student loan it s safe to say that you will be paying it back for quite some time So rather than wait for this debt to be cleared before you start saving for retirement think about how you can take action now For one thing take full advantage of your k or similar employer sponsored retirement plan This type of plan certainly offers some key benefits Your earnings can grow on a tax deferred basis and you typically contribute on a pretax basis which means the more you put in the lower your taxable income Plus you can fund your plan with a variety of investment choices But for you perhaps the biggest benefit is that your employer simply takes the money from your paycheck before you get it and puts it into your account You don t have to pay all your bills first and then hope you still have something left to invest it s already been done for you Ultimately contributing to your k can be a painless way of investing and it may make it easier psychologically at least for you to pursue the two goals of paying your college debts and saving for the future If you don t have a k or similar plan you can still follow the same principle of essentially freeing yourself from initiating investment moves simply by setting up a bank authorization to automatically transfer money from your checking or savings account into an IRA which offers some of the same features as a k You can start with relatively small amounts perhaps as little as per month and increase your contributions as your income rises As you well remember college wasn t cheap And you don t want to make it even more costly by having your student loan payments interfere with progress you can make toward your retirement funding goals So think about automating the contributions to your retirement accounts The effort or rather the effortlessness on your part can be well worth it This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor",1,,,1.0,1.0

At a glance In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn globally as at the end of October The increasing use of ETPs is part of the growth in passive investing The UK pensions market has been significantly affected by regulatory reforms There are a couple of themes at the core of these reforms that are particularly relevant in the context of this article Costs and performance Transparency Liquidity We will briefly consider why exchange traded products ETPs are a relevant investment tool for trustees and advisers to consider when evaluating investment strategies with a particular emphasis on costs and performance In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn trn globally as at the end of October This represents a year compound annual growth rate of ETPs are open ended investment vehicles that generally track an underlying benchmark and are listed on an exchange ETPs are transparent instruments to the extent that index and product holdings are openly published Additionally as they are exchange traded prices are quoted intraday providing both transparent price discovery and accessibility Although liquidity and transparency are additional benefits the increasing use of ETPs is as much a reflection of the growing influence of passive investing more broadly across the asset management industry Investors are now questioning whether active managers are able to consistently outperform their benchmarks and are invariably turning to passive instruments like ETPs to provide consistent risk adjusted market returns Value for money The Pensions Regulator published its new draft DC code on th November In this report it emphasises the importance of assessing whether schemes offer value for money VFM Although there is not a prescribed definition of VFM costs and charges are highlighted as being an important consideration Fund management fees and portfolio transaction costs are referenced in particular On these two cost metrics ETPs are generally more cost efficient than actively managed funds The asset weighted expense ratio not including portfolio transaction costs for passive funds was only in compared with for active funds The above figures are particularly relevant when considering the charge controls on default arrangements in certain occupational pension schemes Lower cost passive solutions become more relevant when taking into consideration the p a cap that has recently been implemented Add lower portfolio transaction costs to this and the case for using passive instruments like ETPs to manage scheme costs begins to resonate with an increasing number of investment managers Cost however should not be considered in isolation In its guidance for DC pension schemes The Pensions Regulator states As investment returns net of charges have such a major impact on member outcomes trustees should pay particular attention in any VFM assessment to the investment return delivered to members In effect costs are a component of total investment returns therefore it is prudent for us to turn to the wider argument of how passive returns compare to actively managed funds and how ETPs can be implemented in schemes to improve risk adjusted returns Comparing active and passive investment returns The regulatory focus on costs and performance are not exclusive to DC schemes The government commissioned Hymans Robertson report looked at how the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS could be reformed The report specifically questioned whether active managers are providing consistent above benchmark returns to justify their higher overall costs Indeed it was concluded that over an extended period of time active equity returns across various geographical regions failed to outperform the benchmark and that this trend was particularly prevalent in the case of developed market equities The conclusions in this report are consistent with the findings in a recent Morningstar study that compared active and passive returns across various US equity size and style categories The research found that over a ten year period aggregate passive funds outperformed active funds across eight of the nine defined categories In light of growing evidence of active manager underperformance the value proposition that they offer is being questioned by an increasing number of investment managers Trustees assessing whether schemes are offering VFM should be aware of the potential benefits of using passive instruments like ETPs either alongside or in place of certain active funds A smarter way forward With the future in mind one area of particular growth has been in smart beta products Their goal is to provide improved risk adjusted returns either increase returns and or reduce risk and enhanced diversification over the long term The strategies implemented are non market cap weighted and deliver exposure to systematic investment factors or alternative weighting schemes Investors can now access a variety of smart beta equity and fixed income exposures allowing one to gain exposure to a risk premium in a cheaper systematic way In the new era of VFM ETPs generally and specifically smart beta exposures provide an additional tool for managers to use in member pension schemes Rima Haddad is head of UK

The short answer is no, not unless you have received permission from the homeowner â€” either directly or through their agent. In an age when everyone has a cellphone camera it can be tempting to take photos and videos when you are searching for a home This can be especially helpful if you have seen a number of properties and want to keep track of which features were present in which home As well if you find a property you really like you might want to share photos or videos with your family and friends to get a second or third opinion or perhaps capture areas you would like to renovate to share with a contractor No matter the scenario I encourage you to check with your agent They typically have access to many photos of listed homes and some may even have detailed video tours which have become increasingly common since the pandemic began If there is something you would like to capture as a photo or video ask your agent to first get the seller s permission The listing agent will let you know if you get the owners approval to take some shots and also if there are any restrictions you need to be aware of For example the homeowner may not want any photos or videos taken of their children s bedrooms or certain home contents and belongings A few additional things for you to consider When visiting a property for sale remember that it is someone else s home Use your discretion and be respectful of their home and privacy Avoid capturing personal or identifying information about the homeowners This includes things like framed family photos and certificates displayed on walls and tables Do not take photos or videos of contents within cupboards and drawers or of any personal belongings If you do get permission to take photos please remember that they are intended for your personal reference only and should not be shared on social media or any other public platforms If you re on the other side and you are selling a property I suggest you clearly communicate with your agent about any preferences or privacy concerns pertaining to buyers taking photos or videos This way the agent will be able to put your instructions in writing in any listings and marketing materials about the home as well as notify prospective buyers agents prior to open houses and scheduled visits You can also take proactive safety measures when preparing your home for showings I recommend placing valuables like cash and jewelry as well as any paperwork with private information like passports bills investment tax and health records in a safe or locked cabinet While an agent must be present during showings unless you give specific instructions that they are not required and prospective buyers are generally advised not to capture any personal information even if permitted to take photos you will minimize your risk by taking these steps If you have a question for Joe about the home buying or selling process please email information reco on ca Joe Richer is registrar of the Real Estate Council of Ontario RECO This column is for general information purposes only and is not meant as legal or professional advice on real estate transactions Follow RECO on Twitter RECOhelps",0,,,0.0,0.0

To understand why this is so, let's look at three common mistakes investors make:","You may have heard that timing is everything. And in many walks of life, that may be true - but not necessarily when it comes to investing.

To understand why this is so, let's look at three common mistakes investors make: Selling investments and moving to cash when stocks are predicted to drop If you follow the financial news on cable TV or the internet you re eventually bound to discover some experts who are predicting imminent huge drops in the stock market And on rare occasions they may be right but often they re not And if you were to sell some of your stocks or stock based investments based on a prediction and move the money to cash or a cash equivalent you could miss out on possible future growth opportunities if the predictor was wrong And the investments you sold still could have played a valuable part in your portfolio balance Selling underperforming assets in favor of strong performers As an investor it can be tempting to unload an investment for one of those hot ones you read about that may have topped one list or another Yet there s no guarantee that investment will stay on top the next year or even perform particularly well Conversely your own underperformers of today could be next year s leaders Waiting for today s risk or uncertainty to disappear before investing Investing always involves risk and uncertainty Instead of waiting for the perfect time to invest you re better off building a portfolio based on your goals risk tolerance and time horizon All these mistakes are examples of a risky investment strategy trying to time the market If you try to be a market timer not only will you end up questioning your buy sell decisions but you also might lose sight of why you bought certain investments in the first place Specifically you might own stocks or mutual funds because they are appropriate for your portfolio and your risk tolerance and they can help you make progress toward your long term financial goals And these attributes don t automatically disappear when the value of these stocks or funds has dropped so you could end up selling investments that could still be doing you some good many years into the future While trying to time the market is a difficult investment strategy even for the professionals it doesn t mean you can never take advantage of falling prices In fact you can use periodic dips in the market to buy quality assets at more attractive prices Suppose for example that you invested the same amount of money every month into the same investments One month your money could buy more shares when the price of the investment is down meaning you re automatically a savvy enough investor to take advantage of price drops While your money will buy fewer shares when the price of the investment is up your overall investment holdings will benefit from the increase in price Buying low and selling high sounds like a thrilling way to invest But in the long run you re better off by following a consistent investment strategy and taking a long term perspective It s time in the market rather than timing the market that helps keep portfolio returns moving in the right direction over time This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor",1,,,0.0,0.0

I am interested in buying a flat above a shop but have been told it would
have to be a cash purchase because the property is on a floating freehold.
What does this mean? Jane Harrison at mortgage broker London & Country says:
Floating freehold probably refers just to the flat. Normally, a flat like
this would be leasehold and covered by insurance and maintenance agreements
that included the rest of the building. Agents sometimes refer to flying
freeholds. This means part of the property is built above land that is not
part of the freehold, such as a bedroom built above a shared passageway.



Either way, lenders are not keen to provide mortgages because of the risk
from actions by the downstairs freeholder. To find a mortgage, your best bet
is to shop around, particularly among local lenders who may be more willing
to help. Remember, mortgage problems may make it difficult to resell the
property later.

The revised estimate to the shortfall, now $1 billion over the next 18 years, will be issued only days before city voters decide whether to opt out of a state law that locks in certain pension benefits. We re not saying it s going to be pretty Michael Carter of Gabriel Roeder Smith Co told the board He declined to be more specific In February the board and its old actuarial firm predicted Houston could make generous improvements to its nonpolice nonfirefighter pension benefits and not pay more than percent of its payroll each year to keep the pension fully funded The estimate has steadily risen to percent of payroll or about million extra next year from taxpayers rising later to million extra per year That s partly because thousands of city workers have switched from a less lucrative noncontributory pension plan to a contributory plan that provides significantly higher benefits When the pension improvements were pending before the Legislature in the percent prediction assumed that no workers would switch plans In a subsequent estimate the actuary duly noted that many employees had switched plans in the previous year helping drive up the shortfall but never predicted that employees would continue to switch The workers have switched by the thousands And District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal has confirmed that he is investigating whether the lack of the forward looking assumption was purposeful and possibly criminal since it helped cause the city to agree to benefit changes that enriched some members of the pension board and their executive director along with other city employees The subject is complex but so is the May election Voters are being asked by Mayor Bill White to approve Proposition which excuses Houston from a new state law that bars cities from reducing pension benefits already earned by employees The law would still allow cities to reduce pension benefits not yet earned That has prompted employee groups to charge that White by wanting to excuse Houston from the law must want to reduce benefits for those who are nearing retirement or have already retired White counters that he must have flexibility to negotiate changes to the plan that might not be possible because of a poorly worded state law City workers are not comforted by his trust me assertions said Fred Holmes board chairman of the Houston Municipal Employees Pension System The city s main pension fund has two major plans one in which employees contribute nothing and one in which they contribute percent of their paychecks Before the changes a year employee in the noncontributory plan would have gotten a percent pension After the changes it rose only slightly to percent In contrast before the changes in the contributory plan a year employee would have gotten percent of salary reflecting the value of his own contribution After the changes the percentage rose to percent Employees are allowed to switch from the noncontributory plan to the contributory one which costs taxpayers more money They can retroactively buy previous years by paying percent of the salary they earned in that year plus percent interest Before the changes few employees switched to the contributory plan But afterward percent of all noncontributory employees switched in the first year and another percent switched in the second Nearly half who switched purchased credit for previous years an average of years each and the rest can still purchase back years anytime before they retire Since the pension shortfall became news this year the number of employees switching to the more lucrative plan and buying back years has actually increased The pension s new consultant said that it would be safe to assume that percent of employees in the noncontributory plan will be switching to the contributory plan in the next several years Virtually all of them will purchase some previous service years before they retire he said He requested that the board ratify the changed assumptions before he used them since they are the board s responsibility he said Since pension board members oppose White s effort to get out from under the new state law it would not help their cause to release any new more negative shortfall numbers just before the vote But they have little choice White and the city hired their own actuarial firm to make a new estimate and that number will be released before the election The pension board now will have a number to compare to the city s by May or May We re ready to get this show rolling and help out Holmes said acknowledging that something must be done to stem the funding crisis White cannot change the pension on his own He must negotiate an agreement with the pension board or get changes approved by the Legislature Holmes said he was optimistic and sounded conciliatory There are a lot of ways once we get to the table to solve these problems he said",1,,,1.0,1.0

(AP) - A report issued Monday by Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett's administration warned of higher taxes, program cuts, lower business growth and steeper borrowing costs because of the state's financial obligations toward the two large public-sector pension plans.

The budget office report said the State Employees' Retirement System and the Public School Employees' Retirement System together have an unfunded liability of $41 billion. Growing pension costs could force spending cuts throughout the state budget according to the report a scenario made even worse by projections of higher spending on debt medical assistance and prisons Like an oncoming tidal wave pension costs threaten to overwhelm the general fund budget and the vital programs and services that it funds the report says The same dynamic is expected for public schools said the report which was published by Corbett s budget office Increasing pension contributions obligations will claim a greater and greater share of school district budgets crowding out funding for education whether it is direct classroom instruction sports facilities and maintenance and ultimately put pressure on districts to increase property taxes the budget office said The report says higher taxes should be off the table but reductions in prospective benefits for current employees should be considered Corbett a Republican has spoken repeatedly about his desire to address the problem which is a particular challenge because case law interpreting the state constitution has prevented curtailing pension benefits for current or retired state employees and teachers His office s report says without elaboration that the state can change components of current employees prospective benefits to conform with prior court determinations regarding deferred compensation It recounts how the problem began with the law that granted retroactive pension rate increases to state workers and teachers including even higher increases for the lawmakers That was followed by a cost of living increase for retirees and then by restructuring the state s contributions that delayed the true cost for another decade The pension systems investments were badly hammered when the technology and housing bubbles burst and they have struggled to recover A law made some structural changes including less generous benefits for new hires The state paid nearly billion into SERS and PSERS during the fiscal year that ended in June That figure is projected to pass billion next year and reach billion by SERS provides billion annually in benefits PSERS pays out billion About people are members a group that includes active employees retirees beneficiaries and others who are vested but inactive Messages seeking comment weren t immediately returned by spokespeople for the two funds and for the office of Budget Secretary Charles Zogby",0,,,1.0,0.0

to Work and Pensions committee chair Frank Field The reportrevealed the average value of BSPS pension benefits transferred out was although in around cases the transfer value exceeded m Additionally itfound advice fees were typically around of the transfer value FCA register confusing The report also urged the FCA to reform its register which lists the details of all regulated financial advisers and their firm BSPS trustees and members were both reliant on the register to identify which firms could conduct pension transfer business it said Both however said it was difficult to use Duringa committee hearing in parliament in December for example BritishSteel shift operations manager Rich Caddy said the complex system of menus and drop down boxes meant you need some sort of degree to find a suitably qualified financial adviser The FCA also faced criticism from adviser body The Personal Investment Management Financial Advice Association PIMFA which said the registerhad an inadequate search facility and excessive use of regulatory jargon in the register entries The report continued The FCA online register is a potentially valuable resource but is currently very confusing Vital consumer protection information such as the suspensions of permissions must be given far greater prominence The committee recommended the watchdog should make any pension transfer suspensions clear at the top of register entries and in search results More broadly it called for the register to be redesiged entirely Additionally the committee urged the FCA not to drop the requirement on advisers to start from the presumption that a DB transfer is a bad idea for their client as proposed in their consultation Whose side is FCA on Field said he struggled to fathom how contingent fees have ever been acceptable for providing impartial advice on a decision such as a pension transfer Our financial services regulator has been rejigged and rebranded but I can t see much evidence of it working better for the people it is meant to protect individuals making life changing financial decisions he continued To propose as the FCA did in July last year abandoning the adviser presumption against transferring out of a gold plated stable indexed pension scheme it really makes you wonder whose side they re on Former pensions minister now Royal London director of policy Steve Webb said although the scheme and the employer failed to make sure all members had access to high quality advice many steelworkerstook good advice and chose either to transfer or not on the basis of that advice It is important not to throw the baby out with the bath water in this case he said The right lesson is to clamp down on those who seek to exploit people and scam them out of their pension savings not to deny workers the chance to reshape their retirement plans if they wish to do so on the basis of impartial expert advice The committee has put together a page report detailing and summarising the

confusing The report also urged the FCA to reform its register which lists the details of all regulated financial advisers and their firm BSPS trustees and members were both reliant on the register to identify which firms could conduct pension transfer business it said Both however said it was difficult to use Duringa committee hearing in parliament in December for example BritishSteel shift operations manager Rich Caddy said the complex system of menus and drop down boxes meant you need some sort of degree to find a suitably qualified financial adviser The FCA also faced criticism from adviser body The Personal Investment Management Financial Advice Association PIMFA which said the registerhad an inadequate search facility and excessive use of regulatory jargon in the register entries The report continued The FCA online register is a potentially valuable resource but is currently very confusing Vital consumer protection information such as the suspensions of permissions must be given far greater prominence The committee recommended the watchdog should make any pension transfer suspensions clear at the top of register entries and in search results More broadly it called for the register to be redesiged entirely Additionally the committee urged the FCA not to drop the requirement on advisers to start from the presumption that a DB transfer is a bad idea for their client as proposed in their consultation Whose side is FCA on Field said he struggled to fathom how contingent fees have ever been acceptable for providing impartial advice on a decision such as a pension transfer Our financial services regulator has been rejigged and rebranded but I can t see much evidence of it working better for the people it is meant to protect individuals making life changing financial decisions he continued To propose as the FCA did in July last year abandoning the adviser presumption against transferring out of a gold plated stable indexed pension scheme it really makes you wonder whose side they re on Former pensions minister now Royal London director of policy Steve Webb said although the scheme and the employer failed to make sure all members had access to high quality advice many steelworkerstook good advice and chose either to transfer or not on the basis of that advice It is important not to throw the baby out with the bath water in this case he said The right lesson is to clamp down on those who seek to exploit people and scam them out of their pension savings not to deny workers the chance to reshape their retirement plans if they wish to do so on the basis of impartial expert advice To view photo click here",0,,,1.0,1.0

A key element of any attempt to ""fix"" the budget is tax reform and, in that regard, the Bowles-Simpson proposal, which raises revenues by lowering rates but expanding the tax base and eliminating tax preferences, has a lot of appeal. Why does this matter to us in the retirement benefits profession Because one of the first tax preferences that will be put on the table in any budget discussion is the one for retirement savings According to EBRI the tax benefit for employment based retirement plans accounts for billion of the total budget for Even nowadays that s real money Just what is this tax benefit The big benefit is this Employers when they set money aside for a tax qualified pension plan e g a k plan or a DB plan get an immediate deduction the money grows tax free in a tax exempt trust and it is not taxed until it is distributed to the employee Why should retirement savings get this special treatment A lot of people think they shouldn t On the left there are those who assert that this tax benefit goes mainly to high margin high paid employees who don t need the favorable treatment and whose savings behavior would not change if it were eliminated On the right there are those who assert that this favorable tax treatment should be provided for all savings not just retirement savings These voices are sure to be heard in any budget based debate about the continuing utility of favorable tax treatment of retirement savings At this point when we re talking about the elimination of favorable tax treatment I think the critique from the left is the more significant one The standard counterargument has been that the current system encourages employers in order to get favorable tax treatment to provide retirement benefits to a broad cross section of employees not just the high paid That argument needs to be made again However those on the left have a point With the decline in DB plans and the prevalence of k plans it s unclear that the low paid really are receiving adequate retirement benefits under the current system Whether automatic enrollment will solve this problem remains to be seen Certainly defenders of the current system will need to produce data showing that the retirement benefits tax expenditure does benefit all employees There s a mildly subtle point here This tax expenditure like any deduction based tax expenditure generally goes to higher margin taxpayers That s a given However if the result is that retirement savings go up for everybody that the tax benefit provides employers an incentive to get everybody in a plan then it s worth it There s another point It has long been recognized that any income tax system is biased against savings Interest is just compensation for the deferral of spending If you tax interest as income which ours and other income tax systems do taxpayers will have an artificial incentive to spend rather than save The retirement savings tax benefit mitigates this effect In the current neo neo Keynesian moment saving versus spending is not favored but in the long run and in real life you need savings As all the ads keep telling us you particularly need retirement savings Of course Keynes famously said In the long run we re all dead What exactly did he know in that in we do not Michael Barry is President of the Plan Advisory Services Group a consulting group that helps financial services corpor ations with the regulatory issues facing their plan sponsor clients He has had years experience in the benefits field in law and consulting firms",1,,,1.0,1.0

These often-cited excuses for postponing key financial decisions â€” such as saving for retirement â€” may be more myth than fact, suggests new research from Principal Financial Group and behavioral economist Dan Goldstein and obtained exclusively by USA TODAY. Putting off action that will boost your financial well being is not about a shortage of money or having too much debt It s more about a lack of confidence in money matters and not having the right mind set the study found Seven in Americans postpone making financial decisions at least some of the time the study found Perhaps more startling is that more than half of the adults surveyed had not made a big money related decision such as making a large purchase a home opening an investment account or moving money around in a k account in the past three years But what s behind the inaction the I ll get to it another day mentality may surprise you The only thing holding you back is you said Jerry Patterson senior vice president of retirement and income solutions at Principal Financial Group More specifically how your brain is wired or miswired when it comes to money is a major obstacle What makes Principal s research different from other surveys that address retirement savings readiness is that it views investors decision making through the prism of behavioral finance In other words it takes into consideration how emotions psychology and behavioral biases can impede or advance a person s savings goals The study asked respondents questions that explored behavioral finance concepts such as recency effect a bias in which people tend to extrapolate recent events such as a big upward move in stock prices into the future indefinitely It also posed queries related to loss aversion or the idea that losses generally have a much larger psychological impact than gains of the same size People have their reasons for postponing saving for retirement Patterson said Unfortunately some of those reasons are not as valid as they think Some of the circumstances people think are barriers are actually just challenges that can be overcome with the right mind set For example while of the respondents said their current income is the biggest reason they don t pull the trigger on financial decisions Principal s research showed that current finances or lack of money do not play a significant role in procrastination If it s true that lack of income or debt is getting in the way of making decisions then debt levels and income levels should explain who is and who isn t postponing decisions but those factors didn t explain the behavior said Goldstein an expert in decision making and former professor at London Business School who now works as principal researcher at Microsoft Research Indeed even one in four high income households those earning more than per year were part of the group that postponed financial decisions And only about half said they would feel confident planning for their retirement What s more the research noted that it only takes a modest income say for people to begin to feel comfortable enough to make decisions that will affect their long term savings So what then exactly is to blame for the inaction A lack of knowledge and confidence related to investing Patterson said Those who do not feel confident about their finances are two times more likely to postpone making major decisions than those who are confident regardless of income the research found New features such as k s with automatic enrollment or robots that build low cost diversified portfolios for people online have helped investors Boosting your confidence and getting over the intimidation of investing isn t as hard as it sounds Seek help from a financial adviser Seek knowledge on the Internet You can get answers to your questions with one or two clicks of a mouse Patterson said",1,,,1.0,0.0

BORROWERS are being warned that they can no longer rely on a mortgage broker to provide them with the cheapest home loans.","James Charles explains how to nail down the best deals as lenders keep revising and repricing their mortgages.

BORROWERS are being warned that they can no longer rely on a mortgage broker to provide them with the cheapest home loans. For years homeowners have relied on brokers to find the most affordable mortgages but the dramatic freeze on lending means that many of the best deals are now available only if you approach a bank or building society direct First time buyers and homeowners coming to the end of their existing deals are therefore being urged to explore every possibility in the pursuit of a cheap loan It could still be worth contacting a good mortgage broker especially if your circumstances are out of the ordinary but it also means checking whether you can find a better deal by approaching a lender direct As the mortgage freeze has escalated an increasing number of lenders have decided that they no longer want to deal through brokers Last week Scarborough Building Society axed all of the mortgage products that it sold through intermediaries Other high street names such as Cheltenham Gloucester still deal through brokers but they do not offer them their best rates First Direct Woolwich and the Post Office all offer competitive mortgages that are only available direct HSBC meanwhile made the headlines last week by introducing its Rate Matcher mortgage This allows borrowers coming to the end of a fixed rate deal with another lender to match their old rate for a further two years There are restrictions however Homeowners cannot borrow more than per cent of a property s value and the maximum loan is Pounds The minimum rate that the bank will match is per cent and all deals will be fixed for two years The deal is also available only to borrowers who apply direct to HSBC Analysts say that lenders have been cutting the number of deals available through brokers in an attempt to discourage borrowers In the current climate lenders who offer even vaguely competitive deals are being inundated with applications Dealing directly with the public means that banks and building societies also make more money for themselves Most brokers are paid commission for every deal that they recommend Cut out the broker and the lender keeps that cash There are a number of ways that borrowers can keep on top of what is on offer James Thorpe of HSBC says Customers can find out about the direct only deals on the market by checking newspapers websites and advertisements on television It definitely pays for customers to shop around Some price comparison websites such as Moneysupermarket com and Moneyfacts co uk allow borrowers to check out the whole market before choosing specific deals Most sites will include the criteria for the deals listed which is increasingly important as lenders reserve their best deals for customers who are considered very low risk Louise Cuming of Moneysupermarket says Lenders are cherrypicking borrowers and the best deals that you see advertised are generally only for borrowers who have squeaky clean credit records By using the search engines on price comparison websites borrowers can search for deals available to new customers with similar credit histories incomes or sizes of deposit The result is a list of the deals that are likely to be available to you The best three year fix on Moneysupermarket is per cent with Abbey The arrangement fee is Pounds and the loan is available to those borrowing up to per cent of a property s value Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds The most competitive three year fixed rate deal through London and Country the broker is from Halifax with a rate of per cent and an arrangement fee of Pounds The maximum loan to value LTV ratio is per cent Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds HSBC has a direct only deal with a discounted rate of per cent for two years The monthly repayments would be Pounds The fee is Pounds and the maximum LTV is per cent The best discounted deal from a broker is with Dunfermline Building Society which is offering a rate of per cent with a Pounds fee The maximum LTV is per cent and monthly repayments on the same Pounds loan would be Pounds Despite most of the best deals being those direct from the lenders it may still be worth asking a broker what it can offer Many of the biggest companies do not charge a fee for advice because they are paid commission if you agree a deal so you lose nothing if you walk away Melanie Bien of Savills Private Finance the broker says The cheapest deals might be direct only but there will be strict criteria Brokers can give borrowers tailored advice on the best deals available to them For example increasingly we are getting people who have been turned down by their original lender or who have a missed payment on their credit report which has adversely affected their credit ratings Whether borrowers find deals that suit their requirements through an intermediary or online the message is the same don t hang around John Postlethwaite of Punter Southall an independent financial adviser says Deals that are there one day may not be the next When you find a good deal call the lender straight away and check it is available If it is book an appointment SIMON J POPE CASE STUDY DAN PIRONTI left and his partner Karen Davies have bought a six bedroom house in Clapham South London at auction for Pounds They needed to find a mortgage quickly or risk losing the property so they turned to a broker for help Savills Private Finance found them a Bank of Scotland tracker mortgage with an interest rate of per cent Mr Pironti and Ms Davies will collect the keys less than a month after they first viewed the property Mr Pironti who works as a procurement consultant says We went straight to a broker because in my experience when you need something done quickly it pays to speak to the experts High street lenders do not always advertise all their deals so you need to speak to someone who knows the market The couple had been watching the housing market for the past six months keeping an eye on property and mortgage websites before finding their new home on an auction website It needs a fair bit of work but we are really excited about picking up the keys Mr Pironti says c Times Newspapers Ltd",1,,,0.0,0.0

In the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis, global interest rates and inflation have remained low by historic standards, and these low interest rates, along with low rates of projected global economic growth, have led to reductions in projected returns for most asset classes, which, in turn, have resulted in an unprecedented number of reductions in the investment return assumption used by public pension plans.","Researchers found a decline in assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation combined with a change in asset allocations, resulting in a higher expected real return, has increased costs for public pensions, but the increase is much smaller than if the decline in the assumed return was due to a lower assumed real return.

In the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis, global interest rates and inflation have remained low by historic standards, and these low interest rates, along with low rates of projected global economic growth, have led to reductions in projected returns for most asset classes, which, in turn, have resulted in an unprecedented number of reductions in the investment return assumption used by public pension plans. Among the plans the National Association of State Retirement Administrators NASRA measured in nearly three fourths reduced their investment return assumption since fiscal year A brief from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College says such a change is generally viewed as a positive development for pension funding discipline bringing assumptions more in line with market expectations and forcing plan sponsors to increase annual required contributions However the researchers say the decline in assumed rates of return is actually due to lower assumed inflation not a lower assumed real return that is the return net of inflation In a fully indexed system where benefits fully adjust with inflation a lower inflation assumption should actually have no impact on costs however public pension plans have also changed their asset allocations resulting in a higher expected real return which lowers costs Therefore a quick assessment of these underlying assumption changes suggests that plans may have actually lowered their costs with the decline in the assumed return the brief says But public plan benefits are not fully indexed so the real value of benefits increases as the inflation expectation drops which increases plan costs The researchers explain that for a hypothetical plan where benefits fully adjust with inflation lower inflation will have no impact on the required contribution because the lower revenue produced by lower nominal returns will be offset by a decrease in initial benefits through lower wage growth and the cost of living adjustment COLA paid after retirement However the actual situation for public plans differs in two ways Benefits before and after retirement are not fully linked to inflation so they do not decline one to one with lower inflation therefore increasing the real value of benefits and increasing plan costs and public plans have shifted into riskier assets which increases their expected real return and reduces costs Public plans may seem like fully indexed systems because they provide benefits based on final earnings and offer post retirement COLAs the brief says But in reality not all benefits are based on final earnings and most COLAs are not designed to fully compensate for inflation It further explains that if all public sector workers remained with their employer until they retired their final earnings would reflect inflation and real wage growth over their work lives and their initial benefits based on final earnings would be fully indexed however of employees who vest in a pension benefit do not retire as public sector employees so they receive much lower benefits for their time in the public sector than employees who finish their career in the public sector The only way for a worker who leaves public sector employment before retirement to avoid a loss in benefits would be for the plan to base pension benefits on projected age earnings that is index earnings for inflation and real wage growth Without such indexing benefits erode in real terms and the higher the rate of inflation the larger the erosion With a lower rate of inflation the cost to the employer increases by making the deferred benefits relatively more expensive In addition the researchers say most COLAs are deliberately designed not to fully match inflation and some plans provide no COLA or only ad hoc adjustments meaning the benefits of many retirees erode in value over time with rising inflation When the inflation rate declines since the drop in benefit payouts does not fully reflect the drop in inflation costs rise At the extreme for plans without a COLA a percentage point reduction in assumed inflation produces a percentage point increase in real post retirement benefits The lack of complete indexing of both initial benefits and benefits after retirement means that a change in inflation is not a wash Instead as inflation declines real costs increase the brief explains At the same time public pension plans have also shifted their investment mix out of fixed income and into riskier asset classes with higher expected real returns which all else equal leads to lower costs as fewer contributions are required to meet future benefit obligations Using data reported under the new Government Accounting Standards Board GASB statements the researchers calculated the net effect on plan costs due to the lower inflation assumption and higher expected real return assuming a percentage point decrease in inflation and a percentage point increase in the real return They found a change in accrued liabilities and a roughly increase in employee liabilities and the associated normal costs In addition using these assumptions a plan s required contribution would increase by of payroll However lowering assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation was actually better for plans than if they did so due to a lower assumed real return because the researchers found that under a hypothetical scenario in which lower assumed returns are driven by a reduction in the assumed real return the increase in the required contribution would be over three times as high at of

I never fully understand news events unless I know the history. I need to understand how we got here. So when George Osborne announced in his annual Budget statement a significant revision in how people access their pensions, with more details announced this week, and called it the biggest change in almost a century, I naturally had to find out what it was that happened so long ago. This took me to a place that few of us would expect to visit the Finance Act This does indeed turn out to have been an important piece of legislation For that was when full tax relief first became available on contributions made to pension schemes In other words it created a valuable incentive for saving up for one s old age It was a further step in a social revolution that had begun in when Lloyd George introduced a National Insurance scheme paid for by employees and employers alike which was in essence a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment Now I hasten to add that Osborne s pension reforms have left the system of full tax relief largely intact Employers will go on taking pension contributions from your pay before deducting tax but not National Insurance contributions But one can see that if the state was going to provide a subsidy of this size to encourage saving for retirement it must have seemed perfectly reasonable to force these savers as far as one reasonably could to use their pension pots to purchase an annuity the financial instrument that actually produces a regular income until death Otherwise there would be a strong likelihood that the state subvention would be wasted And it is this near compulsory annuitisation with its penal per cent tax penalty on spending one s pension pot as one pleases that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has swept away However the problem for which compulsory annuitisation was supposed to provide an answer remains How can the state be reasonably sure that subsidised savings for retirement are sensibly used when the moment comes In its way Osborne s answer may prove to be as significant and as long lasting as the pension clauses of the Finance Act For in his amplification of his Budget statement he repeated that guidance on pensions choices would be guaranteed and that it would be provided by independent organisations And in turn this would be funded by a levy on regulated financial services firms The Treasury also announced that an individual would have had to take advice from an impartial financial adviser regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority before a transfer could be accepted Thus compulsory annuitisation is being replaced by compulsory advice Compulsory advice This is a novel concept In the vast market for financial products there has been a glaring disparity between the power and strength of the suppliers banks insurance companies unit trust groups and the like and consumers Only wealthy consumers have been able to afford the level of advice they require if they are to make successful purchases For the pass was sold in the s and early s when the High Street banks began to sell their own financial products starting with unit trusts This meant that from then on it was no use asking your bank manager for advice He or she had a straight conflict of interest Not a moment too soon this lousy system has recently been partially dismantled Compared with all this Osborne s proposals appear excellent The same body that supervises the major suppliers of financial services would regulate the new advisory firms And the costs would be paid by the industry So far so good But there are a lot of details to be settled In particular it appears that face to face advice would be the exception rather than the rule More reliance would be placed on internet based advice and consultations by telephone This would be a pity For there is no substitute for a full and frank discussion face to face Given that Osborne would have equalled his distant predecessor at the Treasury Sir Robert Horne the architect of the Act But I cannot refrain from adding that when I sought some biographical details I discovered that Sir Robert was known as a womanising bachelor and was famously referred to by a future Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as a Scots cad a whittamsmith independent co uk",0,,,1.0,1.0

If you donâ€™t know the answers, youâ€™re not alone. That may go a long way toward explaining why about 19 million young Americans who should qualify for a mortgage donâ€™t have one. From racial diversity to stringent lending standards there are myriad factors keeping Millennials from becoming homeowners at the same rate that older generations did Many of these factors are outside their control Experts believe however that a lack of knowledge can be as detrimental to first time homeownership rates as a lack of resources In a recent survey of renters said they believed they would need to put down more than to secure a mortgage In reality the median down payment on a mortgage in was just California Colorado Hawaii Oregon Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Vermont tied for the highest median down payments in the country at People don t consider themselves homeownership candidates when in fact they are says Laurie Goodman co director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute Even in areas of the country where it is much cheaper to buy than to rent people think I can t afford to buy because they don t have the necessary down payment Whereas in fact given where down payments actually are they do It s a huge deterrent What accounts for this misunderstanding For one low down payments are a relatively new phenomenon In just before the housing bubble burst the median down payment was Additionally a home buyer who put down less than often needs to buy private mortgage insurance which protects the lender not the homeowner in the event of default and costs between and of the loan amount each year To be clear all else being equal a higher down payment is better When interest rates are low as they are now it may pencil out to pay for mortgage insurance But the math gets harder to justify if you are taking out a mortgage when rates are high You may be charged a higher interest rate if you put down less than since some lenders view lower equity loans as riskier Starting with more equity gives both you and your lender some security if home values fall But building equity is also a key argument for why it pays to get into

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP)--New York Gov.

The Republican proposing his last state budget while eyeing a run for the White House in would increase spending by a rate above inflation while closing what he called a modest million budget gap The budget also calls for several tax incentives to lure and enhance business in New York Pataki s budget proposal for typical New Yorkers would reduce local tax bills help with some home heating bills and provide substantial increases in funding for schools and public colleges without calling for a tuition increase at state or New York City universities Those measures would include Direct property tax rebates of to home owners as part of an enhanced STAR program that uses state funds to pay part of local school taxes Senior citizens would also get automatic cost of living increases in their state payment A pro family tax cut package that reduces the income taxes eliminates the so called marriage penalty in income taxes and eliminates the estate tax A heating tax credit for lower income senior citizens A million increase in school aid to billion both of which would mark records in spending A per child tax credit for parents with children living in districts with underperforming schools billion in business tax cuts to spur job growth Let s remain committed to creating jobs and improving our economic climate building up our fiscal reserves cutting taxes restraining spending and debt and enacting major reforms like those that have made our state a better place Pataki said in his budget statement The current budget for the fiscal year ending March is now projected to total about billion Pataki proposed increasing the state s total reserves to billion and using the billion surplus from the current state budget to reduce gaps projected for coming years Pataki noted the use of the surplus would reduce the budget gap to billion which he said is much smaller than the one he inherited in from Democratic Gov Mario Cuomo I like the tax cutting ideas said E J McMahon director of the fiscally conservative Empire Center for New York State Policy Unfortunately they are very backloaded and the total state spending increase is eye opening For example the end of the so called marriage penalty in paying state income tax and the end of the estate tax on families would be phased in over several years and after a new governor takes over He said state spending alone excluding federal funds would increase under Pataki s proposal It s a spending plan on a par with the budgets during the boom years of the late s and pre Sept McMahon said He noted state spending would increase times the inflation rate The problem is again it s setting the floor fairly high because the Legislature will only add to this He said last year s state spending increase of proposed by Pataki grew to by the time the governor and the Legislature agreed on a budget The full bore increase this year could be close to given their proclivities in an election year McMahon agreed with Pataki however that he is passing along a smaller budget gap to his successor McMahon said the gap is smaller than the one passed on by governors in previous decades GMT",0,,,1.0,0.0

498,#NAME?,#NAME? Brings investors equity upside while trying to limit downside By Thomas Gryta The Invesco Convertible Securities fund CNSAX seeks to harness perhaps the best aspect of convertible bonds let investors benefit from rising equity prices while reducing downside risk when they drop A convertible is a hybrid investment instrument a corporate bond with the option of being converted into a pre determined number of common shares at certain price That allows it to trade like a stock as equity value rises but a floor is provided by the coupon payments and return of the principal at maturity It is a defensive approach to equities said Ellen Gold lead manager of the fund The fund is up for the year as of Monday about percentage points above the Morningstar category average for open end convertible funds In the last three and five years the fund s average annual total returns were and respectively topping the category by percentage points and percentage points Depending on market factors a convertible can be more sensitive to either the price of underlying equity or to the price of the bond Morningstar mutual fund analyst Michelle Canavan specializes in convertible funds there are only about and said the Invesco fund has been particularly good at adjusting its portfolio to the wider environment of the markets and economy This allowed the fund to limit the damage of the financial crisis in but benefit from the upswing in later years Overall she said convertible funds can play a role in an investors portfolio It can be a good diversifier in this environment but it will be riskier than your typical fixed income fund Ms Canavan said The Invesco fund typically looks for convertible securities that offer to of the upside from the underlying equity but with only to of the downside Ms Gold said Once it finds issues that match the profile the fund conducts traditional equity analysis on the company and its stock Because it is a bond the fund must factor in credit risk to some degree even though many convertible issues aren t rated by credit rating agencies If we don t like the underlying common stock chances are we aren t going to buy the convertible she said The fund invests in some busted convertibles which are those that have fallen enough below their conversion price that they are likely to be converted and thus trade more like a bond The credit of the company has deteriorated but not to the point of being distressed Ms Gold said It owns busted convertibles in several financial services companies as part of its top holdings including Bank of America Corp BAC and Wells Fargo Co WFC notes co manager Ramez Nashed The fund only invests in true convertibles as opposed to synthetic convertibles that are typically constructed through a mix of investment grade bonds and long term options on a particular stock Turnover of the fund s holdings varies but has dropped in recent years because the number of new issues has fallen as companies opt to take advantage of low interest rates to issue traditional debt The total convertible market is about billion according to Ms Gold In terms of individual investments the fund likes Gilead Sciences Inc GILD which makes HIV medication drugs and is developing a new one pill treatment for Hepatitis C Ms Gold likes the reliability of the HIV treatment business while also having potentially significant growth opportunities from the success of the Hepatitis C treatment The Invesco fund holds Gilead s coupon convertible with a May maturity which currently has a yield It doesn t sound like a lot but the common stock doesn t pay a dividend she said The bond has a conversion premium the amount paid in excess of a similar traditional bond without conversion which she considers to be low She notes that the bond will benefit from a rising stock price and the short maturity timeline means it will behave like a traditional bond if the shares drop Ms Gold also likes network equipment maker Ciena Corp CIEN because it should benefit from AT T Inc s T recent announcement to increase its capital spending on its wireless and landline networks AT T has typically been Ciena s largest customers Ms Gold said The fund owns Ciena s coupon convertible with a March maturity and a current yield She expects the benefits of AT T s investment may take some time to materialize but should boost the stock If you are wrong you are getting par back but in the meantime you re getting a coupon for the next three years she said Thomas Gryta covers the U S telecom industry for Dow Jones He can be reached at or

504,MoneyTips,MoneyTips You ve made some life decisions that you ve regretted and some of those decisions surely involve money What sort of money mistakes have you made Don t be shy about admitting your financial mistakes According to the latest version of Finder com s annual America s Biggest Money Mistakes survey you have million fellow Americans to keep you company More than three quarters of respondents claimed to have made a money mistake in their lifetime We re surprised that number isn t closer to As Finder com Consumer Advocate Jennifer McDermott says It s understandable that so many have made a money mistake in our lifetime we re only human However while a slip up doesn t need to derail our entire financial wellbeing it s important to recognize the triggers to make better choices in the future What s the most cited financial mistake By far the winner was spending too much money on fun activities such as shopping vacations or dining out Almost of respondents claimed this financial error Blowing too much on fun is the number one money mistake Americans are making It s easy when you re swept up in the moment to only listen to what makes us feel good right there and then whether that s a new dress another drink or booking a last minute vacay empathizes McDermott However it s important to assess how you re likely to feel after spending that amount of money Will it still seem like a good idea when the credit card bill arrives Women were more likely to admit this overspending at compared to of men Are men more unwilling to admit financial mistakes in general Truth be told there was only a one percentage point difference between men and women who admitted past financial mistakes for women for men Even so there are some insightful differences in the types of mistake claimed more by either sex Along with overspending women were also more likely to regret letting their partner control the family finances to for men The categories where men had much greater regrets than women suggest tendencies for riskier behavior Almost one quarter of men surveyed regretted making a bad investment compared to only of women In addition of male respondents reported too much gambling as a fiscal error compared to only of female respondents Perhaps testosterone trumps proper risk assessment Men and women reported the second largest financial regret at about the same rate of women and of men regretted dropping out of college It s fair to call dropping out a financial regret based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS As of college dropouts earned a median wage of per week well below the median of for all workers Those with bachelor s degrees had a median weekly salary of Unemployment rates show a similar pattern for college dropouts for those with bachelor s degrees The number of people naming dropping out of college as a money mistake shows there s a need for greater discussion about career pathways For those yet to attend it s worth taking some time to research and determine your options before locking in your major suggests McDermott This may come in the form of a gap year or entering into the world of internships both of these can inform your decision and help you decide what industry is right There s no rush Doing this could save you a lot in the student debt you accumulate by dropping out without earning a degree The survey found some generational differences but perhaps not as much as you might expect Millennials and Generation X ers were almost equally likely to admit financial mistakes to respectively Baby boomers were least likely to admit a money mistake at a questionable number because baby boomers have had more time to make financial mistakes than the other generations Individual money mistakes were a bit more predictable along generational lines Millennials were far more likely to admit overspending on fun activities than generation X ers and baby boomers Baby Boomers were more likely to regret bad investments compared to generation X ers and millennials Other financial regrets include overpaying for a wedding getting caught in an online scam and having children It s odd to consider having children as a financial regret because we d like to think that your investment in a child isn t for financial payback Still the average cost of raising a child born in through the age of is estimated at over according to a report released by the U S Department of Agriculture and that value probably hasn t been decreasing So you ve made some mistakes with your money Who hasn t Outside of the nearly one quarter of respondents whom we believe simply won t admit it The real point is that you learn from those mistakes and don t repeat them If you continue to make money mistakes eventually you won t have any money left for future financial foul ups Don t add to your money regrets by ignoring your financial report card You can check your credit score and read your credit report for free within

The 62-year-old, who studied music as well as philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, has spent the past decade in charge of investment at the UK's largest pension fund, the Â£67bn Universities Superannuation Scheme. He announced in February that he would retire, a decision that took effect at the end of last month. One could forgive Gray for wanting a little downtime It has not been a small job His tenure has been marked by the aftermath of the financial crisis the eurozone s near meltdown ballooning liabilities and years of sound and fury over cuts to academics pensions At the same time USS has more than doubled its investment staff shifted billions out of stocks and begun snapping up direct ownership stakes in national trophy assets like Heathrow Airport and Thames Water the country s largest water utility Against a fraught backdrop USS s investments have performed well Over the years to March the scheme has returned almost a year on average net of all costs in comparison with a target of a year We have had a pretty good run is how Gray sums up his team s performance It is a typical answer Temperamentally Gray is extremely zen With an ever present genial smile he seems to analyse questions from every angle before replying It has been a busy decade Unlike many the fund manages most of its money in house and the number of investment staff has gone from to It has added new capabilities in credit and emerging markets and formed a specialist strategy team But it is in off market private or alternative investments that Gray leaves his most transformational legacy Pension funds elevated appetite for these assets usually purchased through private equity and infrastructure funds is well known But USS has been at the forefront of UK funds bid to emulate the Canadian model named after the DIY approach pioneered by several of the country s large pension funds Like them USS operates in private markets on more equal terms with the likes of KKR and Blackstone either by investing alongside private equity companies or seeking to source and buy assets for themselves Gray does not pretend this has been easy He says We have gone up a learning curve Take the way people acquire assets in private markets There are quite a lot of assets that come up in auction processes and we have been singularly unsuccessful in auction processes because there is always someone who is willing to pay more than we are Instead USS has had to spend time and money on creating its own deal sourcing team people who have the contacts to bring in deals ahead of the competition The private markets group is quite lawyer intensive Gray observes All of this presumably comes at a price but the scheme says its investment costs amount to of its assets down from in USS s assets have also grown substantially from bn to bn during Gray s tenure That can support a few extra lawyers Critics of USS s investment approach and as the UK s largest pension fund it has many say the scheme is overly cautious They claim it took too long to shift money out of equities and into the bond heavy liability matching strategies adopted by most of the private sector and the result is a bn deficit and cuts in the offing for academics pensions The scheme does have around of its assets today in liability matching index linked gilts and another in lower risk bonds and credit Gray also says the scheme s return has outpaced the a year growth of a model portfolio meant to track its liabilities stating If we had put it all in gilts that is roughly what we would have got But most of the fiery debate around USS is not quite in Gray s remit Pension liabilities have been blown out to tremendous proportions chiefly by two things the fact that we are all living longer and the slump in long term interest rates and bond yields Most defined benefit pensions in the private sector have responded simply by closing their doors In university bosses said they would like to do the same but their scheme is jointly run by university employers and unions and the latter are fiercely opposed Who should pay up to close the scheme s deficit academics or universities is an increasingly bitter wrangle Academics walked out on strike in February and unions have threatened further action this autumn Investing in private assets particularly infrastructure also comes with risk How comfortable is Gray with USS s stake in Thames Water acquired in given the UK opposition Labour Party s plans to nationalise the sector It does put some limit on how much of these regulated assets you want to own in the UK he concedes It had us scratching our heads more than it might have done several years ago I think it would be rather sad if large UK long term investors were deterred from investing in UK infrastructure READ Labour to fight nationalisation battles in court Gray can claim a job well done on diversifying the scheme s investments He joined with a brief to expand USS s alternatives portfolio from to and it is currently sitting around There is one notable exception Back in a key plank of USS s diversification strategy was to put at least of its money even then more than bn into hedge funds It has not worked out that way Gray says this is now less than even after efforts to secure more favourable terms We have done a number of things he says including negotiating the typical management and performance fee structure to somewhere around and respectively What is next for Roger Gray I ask I haven t really been entertaining any conversations about what to do next he muses I anticipate dividing my time There will be something that is food for my soul I think I will take up the oboe

Holly Black looks at the pros and cons

Once upon a time there was just cash or shares. More racy types of investment were allowed only in specialist products, usually reserved for the well-off. Then, in April 2016, a new type of Isa came along that allowed investors to tap into a different, dynamic part of the financial sector. The Innovative Finance IF Isa allows individuals to invest in peer to peer P P loans through the account and earn higher rates of interest than are available on the high street A P P loan is an investment where an individual lends money to another person or a business through a middleman service In return they are paid a set rate of interest for the duration of the loan and promised the return of their initial investment at the end Such investments have grown in popularity since the financial crisis because interest rates on bank and building society accounts have been so low As a result savers have had to look elsewhere for a decent return on their money The attraction of investing in P P loans is that the regular interest payments at higher rates mean you should get a more reliable return than if you invested in the stock market which can be volatile However sceptics point out that because this is a relatively new type of investment it is not yet clear how safe it is or what will happen in a recession should the number of borrowers defaulting on their loans start to ramp up Some P P providers have a safeguard fund which is designed to pay out in the event of this happening and many also split your investment across a number of different loans and in small chunks to protect you from being over exposed to defaults This is important because losses are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme As P P lending has become more popular though the interest rates on offer have come down The market leading P P platforms Zopa and RateSetter typically pay and respectively on their standard accounts Rates can be higher if you are willing to take more chances in the pursuit of bigger returns Zopa for example offers to those who opt for its higher risk account Zopa Plus Downing Crowd a rival platform says its returns range from all the way up to Another issue is that as demand from investors outstrips that from borrowers the former may have to wait for several days or even weeks before their money is matched to a lender and they can start earning the interest A further concern is that as P P providers have grown they have become less discerning in who they lend to In its first year for example Zopa approved only of the personal loan applications it received according to the peer to peer comparison site thWay Today it approves about of applications Default rates are low but have risen among the ranks of the borrowers on the books of many P P platforms This is partly a result of slowing economic growth rising interest rates and Brexit uncertainty having a big impact on the finances of business and individuals However Julia Groves co founder of Downing Crowd thinks that all these factors make IF Isas more appealing Political uncertainty is beginning to weigh on financial markets and cash is not quite the safe haven it once was as many savers have suffered years of low interest rates and high inflation At times such as these diversification is important and that is where the IF Isa can come in The take up so far has been muted though In its first year only IF Isas were opened and m subscribed In investors put m into accounts While that was a big jump Lifetime Isas were launched in and accounts were opened in its first year with m subscribed One of the reasons for the lower demand is that the IF Isa can be a little more restrictive than other Isas You can open only one of each type of Isa in each tax year but with a stocks and shares account you should still have access to the thousands of investment funds available in the UK If you open an IF Isa with a P P provider you will have access only to the loans on that platform That reduces the chances of finding what you may see as good borrowers paying good rates and also means that you run the risk of not spreading your bets widely enough While you can transfer an existing Isa balance into an IF Isa you cannot simply move existing P P loans into another IF Isa you must start afresh with new loans in the account Furthermore if you want to move from one P P provider to another it may be that the original platform can sell the loans you hold to the new provider but this will involve a fee and will depend on which companies you deal with Neil Faulkner co founder of thWay said Peer to peer lending is very stable compared to the stock market especially when you stick to the lower risk bread and butter types of loans The biggest risk is when investors do not grasp the need to spread their money across a lot of different providers and a very large number of loans to mitigate the risk of bad debts To reduce that risk it is important to research the provider you are using and to understand what sort of borrowers are on the platform Check the difference between the interest rate the borrower pays and the rate you are paid as a lender the gap between the two will show how large a slice the provider is taking as the middle man Higher rates of interest are tempting but tend to indicate greater risk If you are cherry picking individual loans to invest in rather than choosing a provider that spreads your money make sure you do your homework on that borrower Even with this approach however you should still take on a number of different loans so you do not run the risk of losing everything should one borrower default on its debt With these individual loans those that are asset backed or secured may be less risky as there will be an asset perhaps a property that the lender can sell in the event they are facing a default",0,,,0.0,0.0

We're used to thinking that what makes a civil case different from a criminal one is that you can't go to jail. But that isn't exactly true. If you fail to show up in court after you've been ordered to do so, the judge can issue a warrant for your arrest on contempt of court â€“ which is a crime.

If you fail to show up in court after you've been ordered to do so, the judge can issue a warrant for your arrest on contempt of court â€“ which is a crime. In the light of Aker's case and the viral attention it received, it's worth asking both why an arrest doesn't happen more often and whether the system ought to be changed so that it can't. Some fairly complicated facts led to the arrest The story begins with a year old student loan debt for that Aker never paid The Department of Education tries to collect such debts and can even garnish your wages to do it But when it doesn t succeed the department hands such uncollected debts to the Department of Justice That s what happened to Aker The Justice Department is busy too So it contracts with a private lawyer to sue you for the money you owe Aker s case was brought on behalf of the federal government by a Houston lawyer with a name Butch Cersonsky that couldn t be improved upon even by Elmore Leonard patron literary saint of debt collectors everywhere Back in Cersonsky filed a federal suit against Aker on behalf of the government Ordinarily a debt collection suit would be in state court But because Aker owed money to the federal government the federal court had jurisdiction You can see where the U S marshals are going to come in When Aker didn t show up to contest the case the federal court issued a default judgment against him That s normal enough and wouldn t have gotten anyone arrested But the federal government acting through Cersonsky wasn t done It asked the court to order Aker to show up and to find Aker in contempt of court if he didn t The decision to find Aker in contempt and then to issue a warrant for his arrest was within the court s discretion It s unusual for a court to order the arrest of someone who hasn t shown up to contest a civil suit but it can happen It s thus technically correct to say that Aker wasn t arrested for defaulting on his debt but for flouting a court order But it s also true that the arrest flowed directly from his debt default Will the incident be repeated Very possibly the answer is yes It would make sense for Congress to pass a law barring arrests for contempt on defaulted debt cases and for states to follow suit The loss to judicial authority would be incidental The gain to liberty would be considerable Short of that the Justice Department should tell its designated collection agent lawyers not to use strong arm tactics in the name of we the people A department rule to that effect might be sufficient Failure to pay a debt shouldn t lead you to jail no matter what the route Noah Feldman a Bloomberg View columnist is a professor of constitutional and international law at Harvard noah feldman",1,,,1.0,1.0

For Bogaczyk, 56, the decision to keep Gene, now 68, at home in Upland has had major consequences. After years of shuttling him to adult day care and having to leave work in the middle of the day to attend to his needs, Bogaczyk decided the logistics of caring for him were just too much. So she quit her job as a special-education aide at the Fontana Unified School District to devote herself full time to Gene. That lost us quite a bit of money she says To make matters worse Bogaczyk s husband Thomas had to stop working a year ago because of degenerative arthritis forcing the family to deplete his k to cover living expenses And while Medicare pays the daily fee at Gene s day care center and the couple s adult son and daughter help out with rent money is tight and retirement is an afterthought It s frightening says Bogaczyk who frets about the day that she herself could fall ill We don t have that problem yet but that s not to say we won t have it As the baby boom generation born after World War II ages and their parents live longer Bogaczyk s dilemma is echoed in some form in nearly every family faced with securing long term care for an aging relative without sidelining its own retirement plans Rhonda Papell a homemaker in Brentwood found herself thrown a year ago into the role of caregiver for an estranged mother in law with extreme dementia This is someone we didn t have a relationship with Now she is basically my job Papell spends much of her time managing a stream of complicated medical billing for her mother in law and wondering how she and her husband will continue paying the a month board and care bill after the mother in law s money runs out Rochelle Mallen a homemaker in Encino felt it necessary to hire a full time live in caregiver for her year old father David even though he is mobile and sharp as a tack Before the bear market set in pressure was substantial on working people of the sandwich generation those caught between caring for aging parents and saving for their kids college funds Now in addition to all that these sandwichers are having to factor severely contracted retirement portfolios into the equation And that is proving a bitter pill to swallow Retirement plus It s like retirement plus says Jason Karpf a marketing manager in Chatsworth who is juggling retirement planning for his mother saving for college for his own two grade school children plus planning his own retirement You have to put yourself on a financial discipline says Karpf It s like a diet Karpf was very involved in helping to manage his grandfather s entrance into a rest home for Alzheimer s patients and he learned from that experience how difficult financing such care can be even when the patient has planned well He had a healthy fixed income but all of it was quickly consumed It was quite a financial balancing act to make sure all the right choices were made says Karpf And while his own mother is in decent shape with a pension from the Writers Guild and access to the Motion Picture Television Fund s retirement home in Woodland Hills Karpf worries about financing the unexpected You can only plan so much he says Even in situations where the elderly themselves are paying for their own long term care the management of that care can become a full time job with serious financial ramifications for the relative who takes it on People are quitting their jobs to give the care then they lose their own health benefits says Bonnie Lawrence communications manager at Family Caregiver Alliance a state nonprofit that helps overwhelmed caregivers manage the dizzying elder care system A survey by the FCA found that percent of people helping to care for an elderly relative had quit their job to provide care and percent had reduced their work hours It causes an economic ripple through the system says state Sen Sheila Kuehl D Los Angeles who introduced a bill signed into law last month that would allow employees in California up to six weeks paid leave to attend to the needs of children spouses or elderly relatives facing debilitating conditions or requiring other care In addition the California Legislature pushed through a tax credit in to help cover the cost of such long term care But that s cold comfort when long term care insurance premiums can approach that amount for a couple in one month The basic categories of long term elder care include in home care by a registered nurse which can cost more than a month depending on how it is billed nursing homes which fall in terms of level of care somewhere between assisted living and a hospital a month and assisted living and retirement homes plus monthly In addition to these full time options there are various forms of part time care such as adult day care centers a day popular with elderly people cohabitating with a family caregiver There is also a growing trend with California at the forefront of keeping the elderly in their own homes and delivering services like cleaning or grocery shopping on an ad hoc basis Some of these services are covered by government programs for seniors with few or no private assets But a lot of it comes out of the pockets of the elderly themselves and their children Of billion spent on elder care in the latest figures available billion came from private pockets versus billion from federal and state coffers according to a Family Caregiver Alliance survey of resource centers including two in Colton and Los Angeles tag f Helvetica f b f i s w l tag Pinched and sandwiched off tag l tag off The owners of those pockets are fully aware of their unenviable situation They are pinched and they are sandwiched says Nancy Wexler a geriatric care manager in Tarzana who helps place and monitor seniors who need elder care services They are also usually surprised at the high cost of services and how few assets a senior must have to qualify for government coverage I once asked a social worker about families and sticker shock says Anne Burns Johnson president of the California Association of Homes and Services for the Aging She said that the first time they begin to explore elder care services they are horrified by the cost Then they get called to the emergency room five times in a month and that s Making decisions about elder care is hardest for caregivers helping middle income elderly people those who make too much to qualify for state or federal programs but not enough to pay out of pocket for top quality assisted living centers or professional home care for extended periods of time Medicare does fine with people in hospitals but it doesn t do anything for long term care unless people are penniless says Frank Weber an estate planner in West Covina So where does that leave adult children of elderly people with expensive long term needs Elder care consultants urge planning as the only way to avoid financial havoc brought on by an aging parent with expensive needs and no assets But they also say most clients they see are not well prepared and don t realize they cannot count on government programs to provide long term health care Our society is not prepared for the impact of having an elder who needs care says Carol Goldman a geriatric care manager at Caremanagement Services in Long Beach They don t have nearly the information or education they need They re like Oh my God this is happening can you help First folks over with or more in assets should look into long term health care insurance which has only been around for about a decade says Joseph Solomon an elder care planner in Los Angeles Premiums aren t cheap around a year for a year old but the benefits aren t usually limited to specific services and the cost of the premiums is tax deductible But as with any kind of insurance reading between the lines is crucial Goldman an expert in the field says she was surprised to discover that a long term care policy her father in law had only covered him for two years An alternative or supplement to long term care insurance is to put assets into a fixed income annuity that is Medi Cal friendly meaning a monthly annuity payment that doesn t affect Medi Cal coverage for a nursing home says Solomon For folks who are house rich and cash poor the best bet is taking a reverse mortgage on the house then putting that into a fixed income annuity creating a guaranteed long term payout Whatever option people do choose to care for their elders they must choose something and plan ahead for it You have to do it for your children and your grandchildren says Karpf the marketing manager in Chatsworth It

Savers passing down wealth could make a 90pc tax saving and cut inheritance tax bills at the same time using littleknown rules in the pensions system. Funnelling money into a family member s pension is one of the most efficient ways of reducing an estate for IHT purposes and comes with the added boost of income tax relief Pension contributions via a gift from family members attract tax relief at the marginal rate of income tax If the recipient is not a taxpayer contributions still benefit from the basic pc relief A gift of would reduce IHT liability by If the person receiving the money was a higher rate taxpayer they would receive in tax relief to automatically go into the pension and that could be claimed back through a tax return This would result in a pension contribution of and in cash The total tax savings on the gift would be or pc Of course income tax might be paid whenever the pension is finally withdrawn Anyone who pays into a pension receives tax relief meaning that their contributions are effectively topped up by the taxpayer Relief is granted at the saver s marginal or highest rate meaning people who earn more receive more Combined savings on gift made contribution family pension Andrew Tully of Canada Life a pension provider said Making lifetime gifts to family members by way of pension contribu tions is a little known area of flexibility within pensions but from a tax perspective is hugely efficient However there are a few restrictions for those considering making a gift in this way Gifts are generally treated as potentially exempt transfers which means that you can hand over an unlimited value without having to pay inheritance tax but you must live for another seven years after making the transfer Failing that at least part of the gift is added to the value of your estate and will be caught by IHT tax a as a to a member s the person receiving the sum of money must also have enough earnings that year to cover the size of the contributions So if the gift results in a contribution to their pension they must have an income of at least in the same tax year Savers have an annual allowance which means that most people can only pay up to into their pensions each year with tax relief Jessica Beard",1,,,1.0,1.0

They are cheap, there are lots of new offers and borrowers can lock into low interest rates for up to 10 years.

Among all the doom and gloom, there is one bright spark mortgage rates are really cheap and a raft of new fixed rate offers is giving the opportunity to lock into low rates for five or 10 years. We are as busy as we have ever been with enquiries and viewings said Mark Harris of Savills Private Finance If you are someone with cash of or more of the purchase price mortgage rates have seldom been so attractive and our experience is that people are looking to invest How low can it go But will fixed rate mortgages come down further I don t believe it is worth waiting to see because the real issue for many homebuyers and even people remortgaging is the loan to value said Richard Roberts of Route Group We have seen cases turned down because the borrower couldn t meet the LTV and if prices carry on falling borrowers who now have equity in their homes won t be able to get the best deal if we see another drop in prices If you take the view that interest rates have probably bottomed out the new year fix from Chelsea Building Society looks interesting Chelsea is offering a year fix at fixed until April It is available for loans of up to of the property value and has a arrangement fee This is an ideal product for older homebuyers last time sellers who are probably not going to see any increase in their income and need to be able to budget Even if they subsequently decide to move house they can take the fixed rate loan with them so it isn t much of a restriction That is not to say that fixes could not come down further but there is no guarantee that they will Ten year swap rates now stand at Given that lenders are now building in a margin of around any long term fix at under looks a good deal Attractions for older buyers Most borrowers are wary of a long term commitment but for older homeowners who want some certainty this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity With the government going to the money markets to borrow billion or more over the next year it is debateable how long interest rates will stay low The lowest I can ever remember year fixes was back in when bank base rate BBR stood at and you could get a year fix at With lenders now wanting better margins any sub fix is going to look attractive said Ray Boulger of Charcols But I think rates could come down a bit further and I think there will be a window of several months to buy longer term fixes He believes that the recession will last longer than initially expected In the short term we could see fixed rates come down a bit but the government s borrowing requirement could push rates up quite sharply if we look a couple of years ahead The lure of low tracker rates Boulger pointed out that most people are seduced by the low tracker rates some at under First Direct for example has a very attractive lifetime tracker at BBR plus giving a pay rate of and the mortgage has an offset facility as well For anyone wondering what to do with spare cash an offset is the best use for this money But for most trackers the margin over BBR is around and lenders are now imposing early repayment penalties so new loans are not as flexible as old trackers When interest rates start to rise as they inevitably will those on trackers and short term fixes may not be able to opt out to take advantage of the longer term fixes Be wary of a BBR benchmark And Boulger warned against using BBR as a marker Not only do we have a disconnect between BBR and mortgage rates but we have a disconnect between BBR and the cost of lenders funds He suggested that a compromise could be the drop lock mortgages offered by Nationwide and C G which offer low rates now with the option to move into a fixed rate at a later date Both Nationwide and C G have traditionally been in the long term fixed rate market and have had reasonable rates in the past Although they may not be the best they are usually a good deal he pointed out For those who don t want to commit themselves for years the five year fix from HSBC at looks a good deal the more so because with shorter term fixes you incur ever increasing arrangement fees which push up the actual cost of offers with a lower headline rate The arrangement fee for the HSBC five year fix is Seize the moment Clients are aware that interest rates have probably bottomed out and are looking to take advantage of longer term fixes Although the five and year fixed rate products are only available to people with large deposits for those who meet the criteria and are happy to tie in for a longer period of time they are very competitive indeed and will bring real peace of mind said Sean Scahill mortgage expert at Optimal Wealth Management People know that interest rates can t go much lower and that locking in at this level will protect them against a sudden rise in the base rate when we finally do begin to exit the recession The clever money right now is definitely on the longer term fix although you clearly need to be aware of the early repayment charges he warns But Roberts maintained that price isn t everything Several of the best mortgages like the HSBC fix are available only direct from the lenders But HSBC has a pretty poor track record I have heard tales of it taking up to weeks to get an application accepted and a lot of our customers don t want that hassle The general feeling seems to be that fixed rates may come down a bit further but they may not And for anyone who needs the security of certainty now is probably as good a time as any to take the plunge and go for a longer term fix If you can get an offset at the same time then get certainty and a good return on your money",0,,,0.0,0.0

At a meeting earlier this week, the Public Employee Retirement System announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher pension costs for the budget cycle, starting next July.

It was a reality check for PERS board chair, James Dalton. It is painful but it is reality We do have an obligation to protect the funded status Dalton said OPB s Learning With Less series has tracked the effects of budget cuts on schools over the last year Today Rob Manning takes a closer look at a key cause of rising costs teacher pensions More than Oregonians get pension payments from PERS Many are retired teachers like John and Cindy Hayden The Haydens live on a quiet cul de sac in Milwaukie with their two dogs after decades teaching in the Scappoose schools John Hayden says the pensions helped them travel to Europe and around the U S Hayden said So I look at our own situation here and all I can say is I don t dare complain about anything I didn t plan it I was just very fortunate Retirement benefits for folks like the Haydens are based primarily on two things how long you worked and what you earned when you left Cindy Hayden says she didn t consider retirement when she was working I mean how many people at or think about retirement You don t she said Cindy Hayden says teachers accepted retirement money to make up for pay raises that often failed to keep up with the rising cost of living She explained And then they come back and they yell at us We shouldn t have done that Well we had a contract At that time we would ve preferred to have had a raise in our salary But we accepted the other as a trade off knowing that it was years down the line perhaps Greg McPherson an employment attorney and a former Democratic state representative said Public pensions are appealing to public officials because they offer the opportunity to borrow McPherson said They can promise something that will have to be paid out over time and they don t have to raise the tax revenue to pay for those today That is an opportunity that is just too tempting to too many of our elected officials And as a result of what they ve done in the past we have a lot of liability we re going to have to pay off because we ve made commitments to our public workers That unfunded liability has grown from billion to billion according to this week s numbers Like many public retirement systems Oregon s PERS system depends on two funding sources investment earnings and contributions from government budgets JimGreen with the Oregon School Boards Association says decades back PERS was not that expensive Green said But when you start adding on things like money match and you allow the board to credit way more than what the earnings of the system should ve been and not put it into reserves then you created a mountain Money match was a system that had school districts and governments matching what employees invested and the market earnings they were getting And pension accounts guaranteed at least percent returns In the boom years in the s return rates hit percent Cindy Hayden said We ve been very fortunate we recognize that Cindy Hayden retired from teaching in when employees could retire on average at percent of their final salary She explained The year that I retired was one of the years where you had a higher percentage Legislators have taken a couple of stabs at reforming PERS The biggest changes affected new employees Workers hired starting in lost the percent guarantee Workers starting in moved into a system much more like a k plan But courts have ruled against attempts to change rules for people who were already in the system Greg McPherson led the reform in By PERS was virtually fully funded McPherson said The reforms would ve been sufficient to stabilize the PERS system over the long pull if the investment markets had remained strong But investment earnings dropped percent in At the same time tax income was down Since then markets and government budgets have been slow to recover workers have continued to retire and the system s unfunded liability has grown to billion There are three main hurdles to changing the system One is legal Beth Ann Darby with the Oregon Education Association the teachers union notes the state Supreme Court has rejected attempts to change rules for current workers and retirees Darby told OPB You know after the court spent a lot of time reaffirming that a promise is a promise and a contract is a contract And to just run new ideas that run afoul of that concept is just creating costly litigation for the state Another problem is political Greg McPherson s leadership on PERS cost him support from a powerful Democratic lobby public employee unions When McPherson ran for Attorney General a few years ago unions backed his opponent John Kroger McPherson is now running for mayor of Lake Oswego He said Several hundred thousand Oregonians have benefits coming to them under the PERS system and to make any changes to those even prospectively is a very heavy lift politically If the legal and political hurdles weren t enough PERS is also extremely complex and changes that seem straightforward simply aren t The OEA says the changes created a radical new plan and before trying anything more the union says the state should watch how the last changes play out But Jim Green with the school boards association worries that without changes to the system or more money retirement costs will cut into the classroom Green explained Classroom sizes will grow because we ve had to lay off teachers Other offerings that school districts have for students and for their parents aregoing to be reduced and we ll do less Some advocates worry that rising PERS costs could have another effect Lawmakers may be reluctant to shell out more for public schools if they suspect the money will go to pensions rather than classrooms Retired teachers Cindy and John Hayden hope legislators won t think that way Hayden said Only people who are going to be hurt are the kids Cindy added No not just the kids It s the kids the teachers it s all the support staff firefighters and their families police and their families It s everybody involved Nearly half of the million in higher PERS cost comes from the K system The bottom line for individual school districts will be clearer in late September when the PERS board receives more detailed information This story originally appeared on Oregon

rearranging your plans You are entitled to a cash refund if they ve cancelled your holiday but many have large delays or may offer vouchers instead If the Foreign and Commonwealth Office FCO advises against all but essential travel to countries or regions you may also be covered for cancellations by your travel insurance if the holiday provider or airline is not helping you Keep in mind the travel insurance must have been taken out before the FCO advice changed otherwise you won t be covered If you don t have travel insurance you may be able to claim your money back through your credit or debit card provider Credit card payments between and are covered under Section of the Consumer Rights Act To start a claim you need to contact your credit card provider directly Which has a free tool that can help you do this Debit card claims or credit card claims of under may be covered under similar Chargeback guarantees This maybe harder in the pandemic but being flexible with your dates could save you cash by moving your holiday to the days with the cheapest flights Being prepared to fly out with one airline but return with another may help you to cut costs as well as allow you to travel on specific days Remember not all airlines fly from the same airport every day MoneySavingExpert reckons that sometimes it s cheaper to book a hotel too as part of a package deal even if you don t use it This is because some online agents offer extra discounts when you book the full package through them How do I protect my cash Thinking about booking a holiday this summer but are worried about forfeiting your cash if something goes wrong There are a handful of things you can do to protect your money from the event of Covid cancellations Book a package holiday Package holidays are protected by the Package Holiday Regulations Under package holiday rules firms are legally required to refund customers in full within days if part or all of the trip is cancelled by the provider including if there is a travel ban However a recent investigation by Which found that not all package holiday firms are playing by the rules Look for ATOL and ABTA protection Before booking travellers should always check to see if their holiday provider is ABTA or ATOL protected ABTA stands for Association of British Travel Agents while ATOL stands for Air Travel Organiser s Licence ATOL protected holidays are package holidays that include flights while ABTA protection only covers holidays that involve rail cruise or self drive If you re mis sold an ABTA or ATOL protected package holiday or parts of the trip are cancelled you might be able to get an alternative holiday or a refund as compensation Both will also protect your cash if the holiday provider goes into administration Flexible cancellations policies Look for holiday firms and companies that offer a flexible booking policy Some allow you to cancel at short notice and get a full refund while others will let you change the dates or destination of your trip if coronavirus rules change before you head off For example First Choice and Tui holidays automatically include Covid Cover which lets you amend your trip for free if you contract Covid or are required to isolate What should you look for in a good travel insurance policy Medical expenses A good policy will give cover of million or more for travel in Europe and million or more for the USA Repatriation service The costs of getting you back to the UK for medical reasons should be covered automatically by your policy Cancellation and curtailment A good policy will cover you for or more if you have to cancel or shorten your holiday Missed departure Covers additional accommodation costs and travel expenses up to or more if you miss your flight due to circumstances out of your control Delay You ll usually be covered for or more if your travel plans are delayed due to circumstances out of your control Baggage cover Covers you if your baggage is lost damaged or stolen Look for policies that have cover of or more But before making a booking check the small print and ask the provider exactly what their policy is for situations like quarantining and Covid cancellations Pay by credit card You can get extra protections when paying by credit card such as if your airline goes bust If you re struggling to get a refund for a cancelled trip you may also be able to claim your money back through your credit or debit card provider Credit card payments between and are covered under Section of the Consumer Rights Act To start a claim you need to contact your credit card provider directly Which has a free tool that can help you do this Get insurance Last year many insurance firms changed the small print of their travel policies to exclude coronavirus related issues But many have adapted their policies to include Covid woes including cancellations and illness related costs However what you re covered for depends on the policy usually the more you pay the more you re covered for Most insurers will now cover your medical costs if you contract the virus while on holiday but only a few will payout for cancellations The majority will not cover you if you travel against Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office FCDO advice Only one in will cover you if a positive or missed Covid tests prevents you from boarding a flight reports the BBC so it s important to check the small print",0,,,1.0,0.0
