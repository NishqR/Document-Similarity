1,992363,"SEE ALSO: 7 Worst Mistakes Investors Will Make in This Market  One common misconception of being ""conservative"" is having a large percentage of the portfolio in a stock that has performed well in the past. Even if a particular stock has performed well in the past, it is never a guarantee of future results. All stocks are subject to a significant amount of risk, including loss of principal. Risks for individual stocks include overall market risk, industry-specific risk, company-specific risk, new technology, new competitors and new regulations--all of which can adversely affect the business model. In fact, the average individual stock within Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has a volatility that is about twice that of the index itself.  Another misunderstanding is categorizing stocks paying large dividends as a conservative investment. Remember that dividends are discretionary and can be reduced or canceled without warning. A company having difficulty may cut the dividend as one of their first relief points. When this happens, people who bought the stock primarily for the high dividend may sell, impacting the underlying stock price.  I have also met with prospective clients who own investments with high current incomes. Though these types of investments may provide a bit of outperformance some of the time, every once in a while they get hit really hard. During the 2008 crisis, many preferred stocks were negatively affected at higher rates than the stock market. Although they may appear conservative since they may go a period of time producing outsized yields, remember that just because they have not been hit yet, does not mean they cannot get hit.  We cannot talk about conservative investing without mentioning fixed income investments such as bonds. The caution here is to understand the credit rating and the associated risk. A promise to pay is only as good as the party making the promise. People tend to underestimate the credit risk of a large company, assuming big equals safe. Additionally, brand recognition can create less perceived risk, regardless of the lower credit quality. Remember that bonds are subject to market interest rate risk if sold prior to maturity. Bond values will decline as interest rates rise and bonds are subject to availability and change in price.  Be aware of your risk exposure. A good way to think about an investment is to consider whether it acts more equity-like or more bond-like in its volatility and take the level of risk into account relative to the answer. There is no magic investment. When you see a company paying 6% while their peers are paying 1% or 2%, understand that they are not paying more without good reason.  I am not saying to never invest in the type of investments mentioned above. One or more may be suitable for your investment portfolio, but that is something your financial adviser can help you to determine based on your investment objectives. Just keep in mind that no investment strategy can guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.  The Risk of Being Too Conservative  In contrast to the ""conservative"" investors with risky investments in their portfolios, there are also investors on the other end of the spectrum who are so concerned about losing their money that they are too conservative for their financial situation. These investors come to us with conservative investments such as treasuries, short-term certificates of deposit and money market accounts. After talking about their withdrawal need, they are often surprised at the possible outcome.  Consider a 65-year-old couple with $1 million, withdrawing 5% per year. If interest rates stay where they are today, they will run out of money in less than 25 years. If we experience inflation, or if they need to give themselves a raise, they could run out of money in less than 20 years, by age 85. According to the Social Security Administration, about one out of every four 65-year-olds will live past the age of 90 and one out of 10 will live past the age of 95.  It is important to understand how historically low interest rates have made finding investments that produce sufficient income difficult. It is very different from 10 years ago when an investor could just park a million dollars in a money market account and collect $50,000 a year of interest without having to touch the principal. A conservative investor needs to adjust to this new environment, which could persist for quite a while.  In investing, so much is beyond the scope of your control, making it even more important to control the things that you can control. This can include where you own your investments, where you draw from and cutting back on expenses where possible. If you have not already, you should establish a disciplined approach to making adjustments to your investments in order to maintain your risk profile. Whether you are a do-it-yourselfer or have been working with a financial adviser for quite some time, you may also want to consider an independent review by someone who can objectively look at your portfolio.

3,341850,"The easiest way to get going is to open either an individual savings account (ISA) or self-invested personal pension (SIPP), both of which are available through a wide range of financial providers. You can have both at the same time, but their suitability can depend on your investment goals.  These savings and investment accounts let you shelter your money from tax so you can try and build up a bigger pot of money over time.  The accounts look similar in that they’re both tax-efficient and they permit a very broad range of investments, such as shares, funds, investment trusts and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).  The way in which you can access your money differs greatly. In a nutshell, ISAs tend to suit people who are saving for medium-term goals like buying a house or funding a dream holiday. SIPPs are much more suited to saving in the longer-term for retirement.  ISAs explained  With an ISA, you can take your money out whenever you want and don’t have to pay any tax on withdrawal.  Also, putting any of this money back into your ISA will count towards your annual subscription allowance in the current tax year.  An ISA may be a good way of saving up money for your children’s university fees and can also act as a back-up for financial emergencies.  You can save up to £15,240 into an ISA each tax year and you can split this between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA.  A cash ISA is like a normal savings account except the interest is tax-free. A stocks and shares ISA lets you invest in a whole host of investments in a tax-efficient way.  Understanding SIPPs  If you’re saving for retirement, a SIPP can be a suitable vehicle if you are happy picking your own stocks, funds and other asset classes.  You benefit from 20 per cent tax relief when you contribute your own money in a SIPP, so if you invest £8,000 the government automatically adds £2,000.  If you pay tax at 40 per cent or 45 per cent then further relief is available via self-assessment.  You can’t access the money in your SIPP until you reach the age of 55, which removes the temptation of dipping into your retirement fund in your younger years.  Once you reach 55, one of the options for managing your pension is to take 25 per cent of your SIPP as a tax-free lump sum. Any money you take on top of this is taxed at your current income tax rate.  For most investors SIPPs will usually work out as more tax-efficient than ISAs because of the generous tax reliefs available. This means more of your money will be working for you in retirement.  Another advantage of using a SIPP is you can pay a lot more into it each year than you can into an ISA. If you have a SIPP you can contribute as much as you earn to benefit from tax relief.  There are two allowances that investors should be aware of: an annual allowance of £40,000 which applies to contributions from all sources in a tax year, and a lifetime allowance on the value of all benefits held in a SIPP and other pension schemes in total.  The information is based on our understanding of current legislation and HMRC guidance. Tax rules can change in the future and the tax treatment depends on your personal circumstances.

5,1439001,"This pronouncement came weeks after the Treasury dropped the interest rate on I Savings Bonds to 2.41 percent from 6.73 percent, citing an incredibly low inflation rate for the preceding six months - a mere 1 percent a year.    So is annual inflation at 3.5 percent or 1 percent?    The discrepancies are painful for I Savings Bond owners and are largely a matter of timing, as explained in a recent column.    But distrust of the consumer price index runs deep. Everyone wants to know what the ""real"" inflation rate is. Most think it is substantially higher than the published figure.    As a practical matter, each of us experiences inflation differently.    Why? We spend our money differently.    Your personal CPI is likely to be very different from the announced CPI. Here are some examples.    The elderly    Retirees complain the most. They look at their medical bills, look at the announced inflation rate and wonder whether Washington has moved to Mars.    Part of the problem is that medical care has a weight of only 6.2 percent in the CPI-U, the most commonly used inflation index for urban dwellers.    Seniors spend a lot more than 6.2 percent of their income on medical care. Surveys indicate they spend about 20 percent. So they are more than three times as vulnerable to health care inflation.    Even the experimental CPI for the elderly, dubbed CPI-E, carries a medical care weight of 10.2 percent. The experimental index shows that the rate of inflation for seniors is higher than the rate of inflation for urban workers.    A research study at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2003, for instance, found that between 1984 and 2001, the conventional index understated the inflation seniors experienced by 3.84 percent.    Had the experimental index been used for benefits, the study found, Social Security retirement benefits would have been an average $408 a year higher.    The OASDI Trust fund, the researchers noted, would also be insolvent 5 years earlier.    Debtors    Debt is good insulation from inflation.    If a third of your income is committed to a fixed payment home mortgage and a fixed payment car loan - a condition that describes millions of households in their 30s and 40s - then you only need a 2 percent increase in income to cope with a 3 percent rate of inflation.

How do you stay ahead of inflation when it's so hard to gauge?  

The Bureau of Labor Statistics set the raw inflation rate for the month of April: 0.9 percent. After seasonal adjustment, it was still a fiery 0.6 percent. The trailing 12-month rate was 3.5 percent.  
This pronouncement came weeks after the Treasury dropped the interest rate on I Savings Bonds to 2.41 percent from 6.73 percent, citing an incredibly low inflation rate for the preceding six months - a mere 1 percent a year.    So is annual inflation at 3.5 percent or 1 percent?    The discrepancies are painful for I Savings Bond owners and are largely a matter of timing, as explained in a recent column.    But distrust of the consumer price index runs deep. Everyone wants to know what the ""real"" inflation rate is. Most think it is substantially higher than the published figure.    As a practical matter, each of us experiences inflation differently.    Why? We spend our money differently.    Your personal CPI is likely to be very different from the announced CPI. Here are some examples.    The elderly    Retirees complain the most. They look at their medical bills, look at the announced inflation rate and wonder whether Washington has moved to Mars.    Part of the problem is that medical care has a weight of only 6.2 percent in the CPI-U, the most commonly used inflation index for urban dwellers.    Seniors spend a lot more than 6.2 percent of their income on medical care. Surveys indicate they spend about 20 percent. So they are more than three times as vulnerable to health care inflation.    Even the experimental CPI for the elderly, dubbed CPI-E, carries a medical care weight of 10.2 percent. The experimental index shows that the rate of inflation for seniors is higher than the rate of inflation for urban workers.    A research study at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2003, for instance, found that between 1984 and 2001, the conventional index understated the inflation seniors experienced by 3.84 percent.    Had the experimental index been used for benefits, the study found, Social Security retirement benefits would have been an average $408 a year higher.    The OASDI Trust fund, the researchers noted, would also be insolvent 5 years earlier.    Debtors    Debt is good insulation from inflation.    If a third of your income is committed to a fixed payment home mortgage and a fixed payment car loan - a condition that describes millions of households in their 30s and 40s - then you only need a 2 percent increase in income to cope with a 3 percent rate of inflation.

9,1290680,"It's staffed by those who know best about college life - college students.  Known as the College Success Center, it serves as a prototype to help cultivate a college-going culture in the Buffalo Public Schools, tearing down barriers that keep students from pursuing a higher education.  ""It's helped me get through the application process,"" said Bennett senior Shaniyah Crump, ""because it's kind of confusing.""  A second College Success Center operates out of the International Preparatory School on the West Side.  More modest versions are planned for other high schools around the city by October, while funding has been secured to start planting seeds about college among the city's middle school students, said Nate Daun-Barnett, a University at Buffalo professor.  Daun-Barnett, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education, spearheaded this project after shadowing counselors at Bennett for six months to understand the barriers students face getting into college.  He realized how much the counselors were relied upon to guide students through the college process.  ""We wanted to free counselors up from administrative burdens to spend more time counseling kids. That was goal No. 1,"" Daun-Barnett said.  ""No. 2,"" he said, ""all the schools talked about creating a college-going culture. We could contribute something to that because we represent higher ed. This is our world.""  While those seeds were first planted several years ago, the initiative had to wait because of a lack of funding. Instead, Daun-Barnett started on a smaller scale by helping students tackle the all-important financial aid form known as FAFSA.  ""It's like a foreign language,"" said Maureen England, a counselor at Bennett. ""We don't have any training on FAFSA, and I was only familiar with it because of my own children.""  What began as a few student volunteers from UB helping fill out financial aid forms at South Park High School has spread to more than 21 public and charter high schools across the city. In fact, Buffalo Public Schools and Say Yes Buffalo now help fund the FAFSA Completion Project.  Say Yes covers the balance of tuition for Buffalo students only after they've applied for state, federal and institutional aid, which is why the UB initiative is so important.  ""It's been a perfect complement,"" said David Rust, executive director of Say Yes Buffalo. ""I'm pretty confident in saying we wouldn't have had the progress we've had without the partnership with the University at Buffalo and Nate.""  Daun-Barnett, meanwhile, received funding to start a full-service College Success Center four years ago at Bennett, a school being phased out and relaunched by 2017.  ""I know we only have 220 students left in the building, but we have a thousand problems,"" England said.  ""We have a lot of students that have mental health problems, students that are pregnant, students that need one on one, so if this wasn't here, I just can't imagine what it would be like,"" said England, the counselor.  The room housing the College Success Center has a collegiate feel: Tables and chairs are organized around a couple of big-screen monitors; a resource area with college brochures and applications is situated at the center of the room; and a few comfortable chairs are arranged in a corner.  Crump and a fellow senior, Eugene Steele, have been frequent visitors since November.  Steele didn't realize the amount of time it took to apply to colleges.  ""Some of my peers, they like to be the cool people and not going to college is cool to them,"" said Steele, 17. ""I don't know why that is. I feel bad for them.""  Crump is applying to UB, Canisius College and St. Bonaventure University.  ""There's guidance here,"" said Crump, 17. ""I want to know more about college - the courses I should take, how to manage my time. It's my next step in life and I need help.""  That help includes anything from registering for the SATs or filling out college applications to tweaking college essays. Filing financial aid forms started last month.  Daun-Barnett was intent on recruiting college staffers who can relate to the students. Most of the staffers are minorities, like the high school population they serve.  One is Cherrelle Collins, who graduated from Math, Science & Technology Preparatory School on East Delavan Avenue. She went on to earn her two-year degree at Niagara County Community College and is now a graduate student at UB.  Collins shares with the students her story of growing up in the Kenfield-Langfield public housing complex.  ""They've never really had people they can relate to that actually went on to college,"" said Collins, assistant director of the program. ""I think a lot of them never thought about it, because they've never had people reinforcing the idea of going to college.""  email: jrey@buffnews.com  Credit: By Jay Rey News Staff Reporter","For students at Bennett High School who feel college is out of reach or the process is too overwhelming to navigate, there's a cozy room on the second floor of the Main Street school where they can find help filling out college applications, filing for financial aid or just getting answers about what life is like on campus.

More modest versions are planned for other high schools around the city by October, while funding has been secured to start planting seeds about college among the city's middle school students, said Nate Daun-Barnett, a University at Buffalo professor.  Daun-Barnett, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Education, spearheaded this project after shadowing counselors at Bennett for six months to understand the barriers students face getting into college.  He realized how much the counselors were relied upon to guide students through the college process.  ""We wanted to free counselors up from administrative burdens to spend more time counseling kids. That was goal No. 1,"" Daun-Barnett said.  ""No. 2,"" he said, ""all the schools talked about creating a college-going culture. We could contribute something to that because we represent higher ed. This is our world.""  While those seeds were first planted several years ago, the initiative had to wait because of a lack of funding. Instead, Daun-Barnett started on a smaller scale by helping students tackle the all-important financial aid form known as FAFSA.  ""It's like a foreign language,"" said Maureen England, a counselor at Bennett. ""We don't have any training on FAFSA, and I was only familiar with it because of my own children.""  What began as a few student volunteers from UB helping fill out financial aid forms at South Park High School has spread to more than 21 public and charter high schools across the city. In fact, Buffalo Public Schools and Say Yes Buffalo now help fund the FAFSA Completion Project.  Say Yes covers the balance of tuition for Buffalo students only after they've applied for state, federal and institutional aid, which is why the UB initiative is so important.  ""It's been a perfect complement,"" said David Rust, executive director of Say Yes Buffalo. ""I'm pretty confident in saying we wouldn't have had the progress we've had without the partnership with the University at Buffalo and Nate.""  Daun-Barnett, meanwhile, received funding to start a full-service College Success Center four years ago at Bennett, a school being phased out and relaunched by 2017.  ""I know we only have 220 students left in the building, but we have a thousand problems,"" England said.  ""We have a lot of students that have mental health problems, students that are pregnant, students that need one on one, so if this wasn't here, I just can't imagine what it would be like,"" said England, the counselor.  The room housing the College Success Center has a collegiate feel: Tables and chairs are organized around a couple of big-screen monitors; a resource area with college brochures and applications is situated at the center of the room; and a few comfortable chairs are arranged in a corner.  Crump and a fellow senior, Eugene Steele, have been frequent visitors since November.  Steele didn't realize the amount of time it took to apply to colleges.  ""Some of my peers, they like to be the cool people and not going to college is cool to them,"" said Steele, 17. ""I don't know why that is. I feel bad for them.""  Crump is applying to UB, Canisius College and St. Bonaventure University.  ""There's guidance here,"" said Crump, 17. ""I want to know more about college - the courses I should take, how to manage my time. It's my next step in life and I need help.""  That help includes anything from registering for the SATs or filling out college applications to tweaking college essays. Filing financial aid forms started last month.  Daun-Barnett was intent on recruiting college staffers who can relate to the students. Most of the staffers are minorities, like the high school population they serve.  One is Cherrelle Collins, who graduated from Math, Science & Technology Preparatory School on East Delavan Avenue. She went on to earn her two-year degree at Niagara County Community College and is now a graduate student at UB.  Collins shares with the students her story of growing up in the Kenfield-Langfield public housing complex.  ""They've never really had people they can relate to that actually went on to college,"" said Collins, assistant director of the program. ""I think a lot of them never thought about it, because they've never had people reinforcing the idea of going to college.""  email: jrey@buffnews.com  Credit: By Jay Rey News Staff Reporter"

Plus, as a British territory with full and unrestricted access to the UK, you also get the peace of mind of knowing that, unlike other Mediterranean hotspots, in Gibraltar it's business as usual after Brexit.  An Enviable Location  Gibraltar's warm climate and magnificent topography, not to mention its proximity to all the popular beaches and golf courses along Spain's Costa Del Sol, has made it a hugely popular the world over - though its popularity with travellers is hardly a recent phenomenon.  To ancient mariners the Rock of Gibraltar marked the very edge of the world, beyond which point one might literally sail right off its very edge; a belief which greatly benefited the Phoenicians, one of the Rock's first colonists, as they expanded their trade networks deeper into Atlantic waters.  Over the ensuing centuries, various naval powers vied for control of strategic position, from Rome and Carthage in the Classical period, to the Spanish and the Moors in the Middle Ages before finally becoming a British territory in 1713.  The British then set about expanding Gibraltar's port facilities, fortifying the Rock and repelling Spanish attempts to regain the territory. Gibraltar has endured a total of fourteen sieges throughout its history, and yet still it endures.  Hence the reason that, for centuries, this iconic outcrop has long-since been a metaphor for strength and stability, as exemplified by the phrase ""as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar.""  Today Gibraltar is as solid as ever; a self-governing British Overseas Territory with a legal system based on English Common law and its own currency, the Gibraltar Pound, which is pegged to the British Pound.  It also boasts one of the largest and busiest ports on the Mediterranean as well as several direct flights daily to several major UK cities.  The Rock-Solid Economy  As a specialist onshore finance centre, Gibraltar balances a well-earned reputation for economic stability, reliability and regulatory and financial prudence with a highly favourable tax regime, making it the jurisdiction of choice for international businesses looking to establish a strategic European presence.  Gibraltar's economy is predominantly service-based, with a significant number employed in the financial services, insurance, telecommunications and gaming sectors. The full list of these companies are too numerous to mention, but include a significant number of well-known UK brands like Lloyds, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Admiral Insurance, GVC Holdings (Ladbrokes, Coral, Bwin) and William Hill, to name just a few.  Gibraltar's strategic position at the mouth of the Mediterranean, acting as the literal dividing point between Europe and Africa, means it has a thriving shipping industry while its warm climate and arresting natural beauty provides for a flourishing tourism sector.  Thanks to this diversity of industries, Gibraltar's economy has proven both recession-proof and Brexit-proof, growing steadily year on year. This, in turn, has made it an increasingly attractive proposition to entrepreneurs, foreign investors and those looking to buy property.  Gibraltar Tax Benefits  Gibraltar's fixed Corporate Tax rate of just 10% is one of the main reasons why so many international companies have opted to make Gibraltar their home, though increasingly the jurisdiction is proving equally appealing to private individuals for several key reasons:  No Capital Gains Tax  No Stamp Duty  No Wealth tax  No Estate Duty  No Inheritance Tax  No Tax on Pensions  No Tax Dividends  Income Tax for Individuals  Income tax for individuals ordinarily resident in Gibraltar is calculated on either an allowances-based system with steps/bands of taxation or, on a gross-based system, both of which have an effective rate of about 25%.  Category Two Tax Status  A high net worth tax residency status is available for qualifying individuals whose net worth exceeds £2,000,000 and who rent or buy what is referred to a 'qualifying property'. This regime is referred to as the Category 2 status. For these purposes, the status limits individuals' tax liability to the first £80,000 of assessable income, limiting the maximum tax payable on all worldwide income to around £28,000 per year.  In addition, Gibraltar has recently entered into a Double Taxation Agreement with the U.K as well as a tax treaty in relation to cross-border taxation with Spain. These two relatively recent developments make Gibraltar an even more attractive jurisdiction where advisers can advise clients with certainty.  Anti-Avoidance Provision  The Income Tax Act has general anti-avoidance provisions which are supplemented by a series of specific measures, including thin capitalisation rules, transactions with connected persons, interest on certain secured loans, dual employment contracts, anti-avoidance defences and transfers of assets abroad.  Setting Up Gibraltar Trusts  Gibraltar has established itself as a successful trust and private client jurisdiction with many active trust companies and international law firms with dedicated trust and private client departments.  Trusts established by a non-resident of Gibraltar for a class of beneficiaries that exclude residents of Gibraltar will be exempted from Gibraltar income tax.  Interested in Moving to Gibraltar?

If this slowdown warranted a mention in a filing with the SEC, some investors might have wanted a news release, as well. And if sales are lower than expected, what about profits?

On Feb. 6, the company said it expects to earn 28 cents to 30 cents in the first quarter.  What is notable is that several insiders, including former Chairman and CEO Wayne Huizenga, sold shares several days before the 10K was filed. Mr. Huizenga, who is now a director of the company, unloaded 4.07 million shares of AutoNation stock valued about $55 million on Feb. 21, according to Thomson Financial data.

18,1208314,"America's outstanding student loan debt reached $1.52 trillion in the first quarter of 2018, according to information from the New York Fed. Have you ever wondered whether a significant amount of that debt is located in your city - or even in your zip code? Wonder no more.The Mapping Student Debt Project at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth used extensive data from Experian and the annual American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau to create a color-coded interactive student loan debt map. Map filters allow you to display color-coded average student loan balances, delinquency rates, and median incomes for more than 41,000 zip codes in America.You can hover the cursor over a particular zip code to find information on the average student loan balance and delinquency rate for that zip code, as well as the median income. Racial demographics may also be included. If you prefer, you can type in your zip code or city and the map will zoom in on your designated area.What's the value in such a map? By comparing all three factors (loan balances, delinquency, and income), researchers can distill useful relationships from the data.You may think that higher student loan balances lead to higher delinquency rates, but the data shows that lower median income is a far greater factor. Higher loan balances correlate more to high median incomes - suggesting that debtors with higher balances used their degrees to acquire higher-paying jobs that make repayment easier. (Think of doctors and lawyers, professions that have high educational costs but great returns on investment.)By the same logic, the data shows lower-income areas are more prone to delinquencies even though loan balances are often lower as well.Discrepancies tend to stand out in metropolitan areas as affluent zip codes mix with less affluent ones. The map of Washington, DC provides a clear example. Zip codes with relatively low loan balances mirror the areas with low median incomes and clearly stand out as high delinquency areas on the delinquency map.Rural areas generally follow the same rules, but smaller populations can skew the data. For example, the category of ""astronomical"" loan balances - constituting anywhere from 100% to a staggering 724% of the average loan balance - is often found in rural zip codes such as 67862 in far southwestern Kansas, 89412 in the northwestern corner of Nevada, and 59025 on the Montana/Wyoming border.All three zip codes also have high or extremely high delinquency rates - possibly the result of a few large and delinquent student loans in a small population.Similarly, the West has a scattering of extremely high median incomes in sparsely populated counties - likely due to large ranches that cover a large portion of the county.Overall, the data shows that student loan burdens are spread across all income levels, but the percentage of gross income consumed by student debt ranges from approximately 2% in the high-income areas to 7% in areas with median incomes of $20,000. That shouldn't be surprising - but what it does suggest is that too many residents of low-income areas did not receive significant value for the lower amounts they borrowed. Either they didn't graduate or couldn't parlay their degree into a suitable paying job.Anomalies aside, the Mapping Student Debt project provides useful information that can help policymakers devise innovative ways to address student loan debt. In addition, it can let you know if you're keeping up with your neighbors when it comes to student debt.Find out quickly at what rate you can refinance your student loan.

19,666958,"When the Dutch-owned online bank launched its no-strings savings account in May 2003, it was indeed a breath of fresh air. Its Direct Saver account jumped straight to the top of the tables, offering 4.3 per cent - 0.3 percentage points more than its nearest rivals, Halifax and Northern Rock and 0.55 percentage points above the then base rate of 3.75 per cent.  Its unique selling proposition at that time was that it was a no-strings easy access account with a headline rate substantially above base rate. It was plan it adhered to for a while - two years ago it was paying a generous 5 per cent when the base rate was 4.75 per cent. No wonder savers rushed to get a piece of the action and it swiftly achieved its goal of attracting 1m customers.  But it has been downhill ever since. In 2005, ING came under fire for continuing to advertise a headline savings rate of 5 per cent within its famous orange lifebuoy even though it already decided to cut the rate to 4.75 per cent. So much for not being kept in the dark.  It has failed to pass on the Bank of England's last two rate hikes and the rate of interest is currently 4.75 per cent - half a percentage point below the base rate which, for now anyway, is 5.25 per cent. ING's account languishes 27th in the savings tables, 0.95 percentage points behind the top-paying account from Icesave.  ING also just cut its rate on its Websaver account (and recently closed it to new customers) despite the likelihood that rates will increase when the Bank of England's MPC convenes this week.  It now has bigger fish to fry in the cash Isa and mortgage market.  I recently highlighted that its cash Isa market had a terrific rate of 6.55 per cent. But it comes with a catch, and a hefty one at that - a whopping bonus of 1.42 per cent which falls away after just six months, leaving the variable rate at 5.13 per cent.  Its mortgage promises not to charge more than 0.9 percentage points above base rate. At the moment, it looks attractive at just 0.14 per cent higher than base rate. But on its form so far would you bet against ING taking it to the max in a year or two?  Perhaps it is unfair to single out ING. With its savings accounts it simply used the oldest trick in the book: lure them in with a high rate and rely on their apathy to retain them when you cut the rate later down the line.  Its mortgage may remain competitive, but providers play with interest rates to their benefit all the time. It may have escaped your notice that mortgage lenders have been pulling their fixed-rate deals left right and centre ever since the latest inflation figures made it a dead certainty that interest rates would have to go up.  Abbey, A&L, Bristol & West, Northern Rock, Woolwich, Halifax, C&G, Lloyds TSB and Nationwide have all either pulled or increased their mortgage rates in lieu of Thursday's expected rate hike.

'I like being free to do what I like with my money. I like things when they are kept simple. And I definitely like knowing that I am not being kept in the dark.''

These are the soothing words that trail the latest television advertising campaign from ING Direct. I can only assume the creative that dreamt up the advert does not have an ING account.
When the Dutch-owned online bank launched its no-strings savings account in May 2003, it was indeed a breath of fresh air. Its Direct Saver account jumped straight to the top of the tables, offering 4.3 per cent - 0.3 percentage points more than its nearest rivals, Halifax and Northern Rock and 0.55 percentage points above the then base rate of 3.75 per cent.  Its unique selling proposition at that time was that it was a no-strings easy access account with a headline rate substantially above base rate. It was plan it adhered to for a while - two years ago it was paying a generous 5 per cent when the base rate was 4.75 per cent. No wonder savers rushed to get a piece of the action and it swiftly achieved its goal of attracting 1m customers.  But it has been downhill ever since. In 2005, ING came under fire for continuing to advertise a headline savings rate of 5 per cent within its famous orange lifebuoy even though it already decided to cut the rate to 4.75 per cent. So much for not being kept in the dark.  It has failed to pass on the Bank of England's last two rate hikes and the rate of interest is currently 4.75 per cent - half a percentage point below the base rate which, for now anyway, is 5.25 per cent. ING's account languishes 27th in the savings tables, 0.95 percentage points behind the top-paying account from Icesave.  ING also just cut its rate on its Websaver account (and recently closed it to new customers) despite the likelihood that rates will increase when the Bank of England's MPC convenes this week.  It now has bigger fish to fry in the cash Isa and mortgage market.  I recently highlighted that its cash Isa market had a terrific rate of 6.55 per cent. But it comes with a catch, and a hefty one at that - a whopping bonus of 1.42 per cent which falls away after just six months, leaving the variable rate at 5.13 per cent.  Its mortgage promises not to charge more than 0.9 percentage points above base rate. At the moment, it looks attractive at just 0.14 per cent higher than base rate. But on its form so far would you bet against ING taking it to the max in a year or two?  Perhaps it is unfair to single out ING. With its savings accounts it simply used the oldest trick in the book: lure them in with a high rate and rely on their apathy to retain them when you cut the rate later down the line.  Its mortgage may remain competitive, but providers play with interest rates to their benefit all the time. It may have escaped your notice that mortgage lenders have been pulling their fixed-rate deals left right and centre ever since the latest inflation figures made it a dead certainty that interest rates would have to go up.  Abbey, A&L, Bristol & West, Northern Rock, Woolwich, Halifax, C&G, Lloyds TSB and Nationwide have all either pulled or increased their mortgage rates in lieu of Thursday's expected rate hike.  Naturally, it is one-way traffic as the vast majority have not been increasing the savings accounts ahead of the MPC decision - even though the rates that underpin deposit account deals have been rising too.

26,217808,"""I hope and pray they start releasing some money,"" said homeowner Arthur Woodson, a disabled veteran who lives in a house like many in Flint: built with lead plumbing that, until the city switched to a new water source in 2014, was considered safe.  For residents who already fear their health has been compromised by the water, the emerging related costs are adding to the anxiety, especially considering Flint, a city of 100,000, is among the poorest of its size in the country. The city has for years been dealing with unemployment rates that exceed the national average. With the water crisis now filling daily headlines, many in Flint say banks are refusing to offer refinancing that could free up money to pay for the retrofitting, and that the costs are not covered by insurance.  The crisis has created a perfect storm to strip their houses of their remaining value, they say.  ""People feel absolutely trapped,"" said Melissa Mays, a homeowner and activist. ""We feel like prisoners in our own homes. We're being poisoned by the very homes we live in.""  The crisis first became known in April 2014, when the city switched its water supply to the Flint River as a temporary measure before a pipeline was built to another source. The change was intended to save money. But soon, residents complained of foul-smelling, odd-colored water.  The Flint River water's high chloride content wasn't treated as required, a state task force has reported, and is thought to have weakened the city's aging water distribution system, which contains a high percentage of lead pipes and plumbing. That is believed to have sent high volumes of lead into the city's drinking water.  That corrosive Flint River water also is thought to have similarly damaged the pipes and appliances in homes throughout Flint.  Homeowners could shoulder a burden of $4,000 or more to cover the costs of a new water heater, a new plumbing system featuring PVC piping that is not susceptible to corrosion, and a new service line connection, which is the most costly component because it involves excavation and piping that can extend up to 30 feet from the house to the street, according to Marc Edwards, a national expert on municipal water quality at Virginia Tech.  Edwards has been leading a team of researchers in conducting water tests in Flint, and estimates that correcting the damage caused from corrosion to the water system will cost between $20 million and $200 million. The city says the replacement cost for an entirely new system could be $1.5 billion.  Some residents, including Mays, have already gone through more than one water heater since the crisis began. There is also the worry that new appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, are vulnerable to corrosion from the water and will need to be replaced.  Sergio Kapusta, a fellow at NACE International, an industry organization that develops corrosion prevention and control standards in Houston, says that ""changing all the mains in the city will not really solve the problem for the homeowners"" because the lead piping in these homes probably has been severely compromised. ""The corrosion is not going away. It's still there,"" he says.  Before homeowners do anything, they need to wait for the city either to correct sections of its system that are corroded or to replace the system.  ""If you just replace your section, you're still getting all the garbage from the city,"" he said.  Kapusta, who teaches material science at Rice University, says that in the meantime the only option for a homeowner is to install a water purification system for basic needs and to drink bottled water.  ""There is not a cheap and easy solution, but it's all you can do until the city replaces the pipes,"" he said.  This week, President Obama pledged $80 million in federal money to help in the recovery, and the Michigan House approved $28 million in emergency funding for Flint. The state budget director will open hearings on the budget Feb. 10, but it is not certain how much money, if any, will be allotted to help defray homeowner costs. Anna Heaton, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Snyder (R), would not offer specifics. She said that Snyder ""is considering every available resource to help with infrastructure replacement"" and added that ""plans are preliminary, but they are certainly in progress.""  While Flint residents wait, they also face an increased number of shut-off notices due to unpaid bills. In August, Genesee Circuit Judge Archie Hayman issued an emergency injunction to stop them, but last week finance director Jody Lundquist said the city will begin issuing water shut-off notices soon. Kristin Moore, a city spokeswoman, said Flint has a legal obligation to bill for utility services, but that the state of emergency declared by Snyder is forcing the city to review its policy on shut-off notices. None have been issued since December.  The shut offs have raised the ire of some state lawmakers. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced an immediate investigation into the crisis, which will include looking at possible violations at the local level.  ""If you can't drink the water, you shouldn't be billed for it. That's nuts and must be fixed,"" he wrote on Twitter this week.  State Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D) said that a lack of a plan to address the mounting costs affecting residents adds to the crisis. He suggests the city needs to provide a credit for residents who have been paying for water during the time that it was known to be toxic, and that there should be a moratorium on shut-off notices ""until there is a system-wide certainty the water is safe.""  ""Pretending to go after money that will never be collected is a massive waste of time and also a massive waste of money,"" he said. ""You are going after people who did nothing wrong.""  Two class-action lawsuits were filed by Flint residents last week against Snyder and other state officials demanding that the city end water shut offs and that the court declare that residents should not be required to pay past or future water bills for undrinkable water. One lawsuit accuses the state of destroying property values.  national@washpost.com","If a lead-laced water supply wasn't enough to deal with, many residents of Flint, Mich., face a new crisis: Replacing the water heaters, pipes and even the service lines to their homes that may have been damaged by the city's water.

A Thurston County Superior Court judge on April 23 allowed Kreidler's emergency rule to remain in effect by denying an insurance industry request for a preliminary injunction. Judge Mary Sue Wilson found that industry associations challenging the rule were unlikely to succeed with their two main arguments that Kreidler lacked ""good cause"" and had no authority to issue the rule.  The groups issued a memo to insurance consumers in early May, warning about the impacts of the rule change:  ""The Commissioner's rule is already causing significant disruption in Washington's insurance market, and the negative effects will be felt over the next several weeks — by consumers and insurance producers, as well as lenders, realtors, auto dealers and others who conduct transactions that require insurance, such as home sales, auto, RV and boat sales, auto leases, rental agreements and more.""

His most recent effort failed when a bill he backed, Senate Bill 5010, was gutted by an insurance industry amendment in the Senate Business, Financial Services & Trade Committee on Feb. 15.  Kreidler said rate changes will not happen immediately, and consumers will begin seeing changes to their premiums during individual renewal periods, which can occur at different times depending on when policyholders bought coverage.  ""The industry associations have put out scare tactics lately about how they'll be forced to increase premiums because they can no longer use an unreliable practice,"" Kreidler said in a statment.

30,1369836,"Kent-based Nicola Marshall, like other benefit claimants, will be subject to a four-year-long benefit freeze under a clampdown announced in the chancellor’s budget. Money is a struggle, the 37-year-old admits – she says she and her 11-year-old daughter Lily-May barely get by.  I have always worked and I’ve been given pay rises, but I’m no better off  Nicola Marshall  Marshall works 21 hours a week for a company that manufactures showers, and campaigns for Gingerbread, the single parent charity. She receives £107 a week from working tax credit and child benefit. She also gets fortnightly housing benefit of £200.  She recently got a £100-a-month pay rise but says this has been entirely wiped out by an equivalent recent reduction in her benefits. The freeze on her benefits comes as a further blow.  “What I find really frustrating is I have always worked and I’ve been given pay rises, but I’m no better off because if you earn more money the benefits get taken away from you,” she says. “Freezing benefits is effectively a further cut and is going to be very stressful.”  She says that life has already become a lot more expensive after she had to fork out hundreds of pounds for Lily-May’s secondary school uniform.  “I am hoping at some point I’ll start earning enough not to worry about money,” she adds. “There is a light at the end of the tunnel, but it is hard sometimes.” Lisa Bachelor and Juliet Stott  The Thompson family  The budget brought a sigh of relief for the Thompsons: there had been media speculation that the chancellor could tax disability living allowance (DLA) payments as part of his £12bn welfare cuts package, which would have left them at least £1,000 a year out of pocket.  Elizabeth and Andy Thompson of Selby, north Yorkshire, claim £400 DLA every four weeks on behalf of their eldest daughter Eleanor, aged seven, who is deaf. The cash is vital to help the family cope with the expense of the 100-mile round trips for Eleanor’s regular hospital appointments.  They have also used it to help pay for sign language lessons for Andy, and for specialist books and equipment for Eleanor.  However, the chancellor didn’t tax DLA and promised that – unlike many other benefits and tax credits which were frozen – it would continue to rise in line with inflation each year.  “It’s a relief,” said Elizabeth, “DLA helps us with the additional costs of ensuring Eleanor lives a normal life. Having it takes the pressure off.”  Elizabeth was also pleased, as someone who makes monthly trips with Eleanor to see medical specialists, that the chancellor pledged to make the NHS a spending priority: “I was very encouraged to see increases in NHS funding. It’s good news that the NHS is going to be protected.”  The National Deaf Children’s Society had been lobbying to protect the value of DLA payments. Taxing or freezing it would have left many families struggling to pay for extra support, including therapy, specialist equipment, travel costs and communication support.  Elizabeth, like her husband a civil engineer, thought that overall the budget was “not too bad”. But she remains cautious about the future: “If the government is going to continue to make cuts, who knows what next year brings?” Patrick Butler  Tim Graves  The initial indications are that Tim Graves, 51, will be “a bit over £100 a year better off” as a result of the tax changes in the budget. He lives near Farnborough, Hampshire, and has a “relatively well-paid” job as a solutions specialist for a large computer company.  He has mixed views about the contents of George Osborne’s budget box. Having worked for the same employer since 1989 he has been able to pay a decent amount into savings and pensions: “I’ve put something like £20,000 a year into my pension.”  Graves had been fearing a pensions “raid” but believes he is unaffected by the cuts to the pensions tax relief enjoyed by high earners, though he will be meeting his financial adviser. He says the cut in the lifetime allowance – the maximum amount that can be saved into a pension – from £1.25m to £1m from April 2016 that was announced in the March budget is “a worry for me – and not just me, but an awful lot of people”.  I’ve thought about buy-to-let and I have to say that I’m not sure I agree with it morally. It’s driving up house prices  Tim Graves  As predicted, Osborne announced changes that he said would lift all but the very richest households out of inheritance tax. However, Graves, who is single with no children, says he suspects he is probably “unusual” in that he personally did not have any issues with the inheritance tax threshold staying lower. “I’m responsible for myself, and I personally don’t need [the money from his parents]. If the offspring are reliant on their parents dying, that’s a pretty iffy financial proposition anyway.”  The budget included a tax relief cut for buy-to-let landlords. Graves is unaffected – he has lodgers but doesn’t own an investment property. “I’ve thought about buy-to-let and I have to say that I’m not sure I agree with it morally. It’s driving up house prices.”  He also has concerns about how the changes to tax credits will affect some people, and as someone who donates a reasonable amount to charity he says he wishes there could have been measures to make it easier and quicker to support good causes, such as improvements to the gift-aid regime. Rupert Jones  Nigel Dowdney  It’s hard to miss the colourful facade of the Stalham Shopper convenience store in the north Norfolk town from which it takes its name, but owner Nigel Dowdney (above) fears for the worst if proposals to relax current Sunday trading laws become a reality in this area. He also worries about how much the new national living wage will increase his staffing costs.  In his budget speech the chancellor gave the green light for counties and elected mayors to be handed new powers to set Sunday trading hours in their areas.  The owner of two convenience stores – one in Stalham and the other closer to Norwich – Dowdney says he would have to consider closing at least one because of the inevitable haemorrhage of business to larger supermarkets who would be allowed to trade for an extra two hours on Sundays.  The Stalham store is located just 500m from a Tesco outlet and would be badly affected by changes to trading hours. The arrival of Tesco had already had a major impact on the town and it was important to limit any further adverse effects, he said.  He had a taste of the possible impact when trading hours were relaxed during the Olympics in 2012. “In the first three Sundays my shop lost 20% of its sales and 30% of its footfall – and that is in a period when we would usually see an increase in footfall and sales due to people coming here on holiday.”  On a typical Sunday the usual pattern is that the Stalham shop has steady business until 4pm (when Tesco closes), followed by a spike in footfall at around 5pm-6pm until it closes at 9pm, as people stock up with food and drink for the evening.  Dowdney employs 31 staff across the two sites and fears that he might have to cut jobs and even close a store if the council agrees to relax legislation. The new national living wage would also bump up his wage bill. He admits: “I rely on Sunday trading and – along with similar restrictions at Easter – it is what keeps us going.” Rebecca Smithers  Michael Brisbourne Shop-owner Michael Brisbourne reckons it was a “good” budget overall, and firmly supports the scrapping of inheritance tax on the vast majority of family homes. But he was less keen on the decision to cut pension tax relief for higher earners.  Brisbourne, 52, is the director of the Peterborough Recliner Centre, a furniture store in the city which he bought about five years ago, and he has one full-time and one part-time employee.  Cuts to inheritance tax mean the amount people can leave to their children tax-free will eventually increase to £1m if it includes a family home. Brisbourne, who lives on his own and owns a flat, said: “I think that’s great. We all go to work to make a better life for ourselves, and we all pay tax, so I don’t see why I can’t leave [my property] to my family.”  If someone is paying into something to look after their future, why should they be penalised?  Michael Brisbourne  Brisbourne pays into a pension but does not fall into the higher earner category being targeted by the chancellor. Nevertheless, he does not support the cut in pensions tax relief which will affect those earning more than £110,000 a year. “I don’t agree with that. If someone is paying into something to look after their future, why should they be penalised for it?”  Brisbourne’s accountant, Shaz Nawaz at AA Accountants in Peterborough, said the move on pensions tax relief was “short-sighted”, adding: “We should be encouraging people to invest more into their pension pots, especially as we’re living longer as a nation.” Rupert Jones","Guardian writers asked people across the country – from a family in north Yorkshire to a convenience-store owner in Norfolk – for their views

Refinance your auto loan  If you didn't know your credit score or shop around for a loan when you bought your car, it's hard to know whether you got the best possible rate.  Dealerships "" where most people finance their cars "" may offer very low-interest financing. But sometimes the rate you get isn't the lowest you could have qualified for. 'Most people have no idea' when it happens to them, says Delvin Davis, senior research analyst at the Center for Responsible Lending.  To see if you can reduce your interest rate and monthly payment, you can apply to refinance your auto loan, meaning you pay off your current loan with a new one from a different lender. This can really save you money if:  * You originally agreed to a higher interest rate than you needed to, or  * Your credit has improved and you qualify for a lower interest rate  Lenders have varying credit and vehicle requirements, so compare multiple offers to find the best rate and terms. Just be sure to apply to all lenders within 14 days to minimize the impact on your credit score when lenders perform a credit inquiry. Multiple inquiries for the same type of loan within a short period are typically treated as one, but it's smart to check your report afterward to confirm this is the case.  All this might be easier than it sounds. You can check your credit, compare rates, estimate savings and apply online. Check with your current bank or credit union, too. It may offer the best deal because it already has a relationship with you, Davis says.  But be careful: If you can lower your payment only by extending the length of your new loan, you'll pay more interest overall, making your car more expensive. It also puts you at risk of owing more than your car is worth. Take a longer loan term only if you're struggling to make payments and need to avoid defaulting to preserve your credit score, Davis advises.  And if you really can't afford your monthly payment but still need a car, consider downsizing to a less expensive one.  Shop car insurance rates  There's just one way to make sure you have the cheapest car insurance possible: Compare quotes.

'Each insurance company values different things when setting rates,' says Janet Ruiz, a spokesperson for the Insurance Information Institute. That's why shopping around is essential to getting the most competitive rate for your current situation.

And in many states, bad credit can impact your rate even more than causing an accident, according to NerdWallet analysis.  If you drive very little and don't mind having your driving tracked, you might find greater savings with per-mile insurance from companies like Metromile, Esurance or Milewise from Allstate.

33,187657,"“We doubt that our 18 directors misconstrued your words ‘The original affiliation is history,' and subsequently, ‘The affiliation is dead,' ” Isherwood and interim CEO Keith Ghezzi fired back in a letter to Highmark. They maintained they would not drop their position that Highmark breached their agreement.  The proposed $475 million affiliation between the state's largest health insurer and the region's second-largest hospital network collapsed two weeks ago when West Penn Allegheny officials said Highmark demanded that the health system declare bankruptcy to restructure nearly $1 billion in debt.  Highmark for now has stopped second-phase renovation projects at West Penn Hospital in Bloomfield and Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville because of the health system's claim of a breach.  The escalating feud prompted top physicians from West Penn Allegheny to lash out at its board, demanding the resignation of the system's interim management team. The board received letters from three doctors' groups, one of which asked for board representation of doctors from each of the five hospitals.  In a memo to employees, Isherwood rejected suggestions to fire Ghezzi and his Alvarez & Marsal team, saying the board voted to back out of the Highmark deal, not the consultants.  “I must admit that I was very hurt when I learned that ‘unnamed WPAHS physician leaders' spoke with the Tribune-Review about the contents of one such letter before I had even received it,” Isherwood wrote.  In their letter to West Penn Allegheny, the Highmark leaders expressed shock over West Penn Allegheny's interpretation of their plan. They said they want to move forward with the agreement.  Highmark filed a civil suit against West Penn Allegheny seeking an injunction. If upheld, the breach could cost the insurer repayment of $100 million in loans it extended to the health system. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Oct. 25-26.  Isherwood and Ghezzi said Highmark officials told them even if the board agreed to debt restructuring and a pension transfer to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the insurer could not assure them it would complete the acquisition.  “It is shocking to us that you would characterize these proposals as ‘eminently reasonable approaches,' ” the West Penn Allegheny letter states.  The hospital leaders said the health system contracted with New York City-based Alvarez & Marsal at Highmark's urging.  “While I completely understand that this organization is consultantweary, A&M is doing the job that the board hired them to do and is doing it well,” Isherwood told employees. “... A management change at this critical juncture would not only be extremely disruptive, but could also set WPAHS back.”  A Highmark executive told the Trib it's important to resume negotiations soon because the system's financial condition is weak.  The executive, who asked not to be identified, said West Penn Allegheny's intent to keep the loan money and $100 million more in grants is “completely absurd.”  “We've never left the table,” the official told the Trib. “They were the party that left.

In a war of letters, two top Highmark Inc. officials on Friday said the West Penn Allegheny Health System board “completely misconstrued” the insurer's plan to restructure the health system's debt and urged them to drop a breach of affiliation claim.

“What we intended and presented was a plea and a plan to jointly approach your major creditors about a debt restructuring,” Highmark CEO William Winkenwerder and board chair Robert Baum wrote to West Penn Allegheny board chair Jack Isherwood. “The proposals we discussed would fully protect the pensions of all WPAHS employees.”
“We doubt that our 18 directors misconstrued your words ‘The original affiliation is history,' and subsequently, ‘The affiliation is dead,' ” Isherwood and interim CEO Keith Ghezzi fired back in a letter to Highmark. They maintained they would not drop their position that Highmark breached their agreement.  The proposed $475 million affiliation between the state's largest health insurer and the region's second-largest hospital network collapsed two weeks ago when West Penn Allegheny officials said Highmark demanded that the health system declare bankruptcy to restructure nearly $1 billion in debt.  Highmark for now has stopped second-phase renovation projects at West Penn Hospital in Bloomfield and Forbes Regional Hospital in Monroeville because of the health system's claim of a breach.  The escalating feud prompted top physicians from West Penn Allegheny to lash out at its board, demanding the resignation of the system's interim management team. The board received letters from three doctors' groups, one of which asked for board representation of doctors from each of the five hospitals.  In a memo to employees, Isherwood rejected suggestions to fire Ghezzi and his Alvarez & Marsal team, saying the board voted to back out of the Highmark deal, not the consultants.  “I must admit that I was very hurt when I learned that ‘unnamed WPAHS physician leaders' spoke with the Tribune-Review about the contents of one such letter before I had even received it,” Isherwood wrote.  In their letter to West Penn Allegheny, the Highmark leaders expressed shock over West Penn Allegheny's interpretation of their plan. They said they want to move forward with the agreement.  Highmark filed a civil suit against West Penn Allegheny seeking an injunction. If upheld, the breach could cost the insurer repayment of $100 million in loans it extended to the health system. A hearing on the injunction is scheduled for Oct. 25-26.  Isherwood and Ghezzi said Highmark officials told them even if the board agreed to debt restructuring and a pension transfer to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the insurer could not assure them it would complete the acquisition.  “It is shocking to us that you would characterize these proposals as ‘eminently reasonable approaches,' ” the West Penn Allegheny letter states.

37,1060796,"The fall is a boost for first-time buyers seeking a foothold on the housing ladder, the bank claimed. However, a leading Scottish housing market expert warned that the report glosses over the main obstacle facing first-time buyers - the reluctance of lenders to provide more affordable loans for those with small deposits.  The average monthly mortgage repayment in Scotland is GBP424, while the typical take-home pay is GBP1,954 a month. Only in Northern Ireland do mortgage payments soak up less of the average monthly earnings (at 20 per cent), while they account for 36 and 35 per cent in London and west of England respectively.  Affordability for new borrowers - including home-movers and first-time buyers - is at its best for almost a decade, said the bank, which attributed the change to lower house prices and reduced mortgage rates.  Of the 10 most affordable areas in the UK, seven are in Scotland, led by West Dunbartonshire - where mortgage payments account for just 17.6 per cent of average local earnings - Renfrewshire and Ayrshire (both 17.9 per cent).  The least affordable local authorities are Aberdeenshire, Perth & Kinross and Edinburgh City. Borrowers in all three areas spend more than 27 per cent of their take-home pay on their home loans.  Nitesh Patel, housing economist at Bank of Scotland, said: ""The favourable mortgage affordability position is a boost for both those who already have a mortgage and those who are able to raise the required deposit to buy a home.  ""Higher deposit requirements and low, or negative levels, of housing equity for many homeowners, however, mean that significant numbers of would-be homebuyers and movers remain unable to enter the market.""  The main reason for that is the caution of lenders, according to Dr John Boyle, head of research at Rettie & Co.  He pointed out that improved affordability also reflects the bigger deposits being put down by buyers, enabling them to secure lower mortgage rates. But while those able to afford the average deposit - around 20 per cent - are benefiting from more affordable mortgages, those who cannot are still struggling.  The Bank of England's funding for lending scheme (FLS), launched last August and giving lenders access to cheaper borrowing, has helped push mortgage costs down, Boyle added. ""However, until the macroeconomic conditions in the market improve, it is difficult to see the caution of the banks lifting,"" he warned.  But one trend will be being bucked on Monday with the launch of a new interest-only mortgage. Clydesdale Bank's new three-year ""low start mortgage"" is launched in the wake of a mass exodus of lenders from the interest-only market.  The new Clydesdale loan allows borrowers to fix their mortgage on interest-only terms before moving onto the bank's standard variable rate at the end of that period.","Scotland is the UK's second most affordable place to own a home as the cost of mortgage repayments continues to fall, according to a report out today.

In a letter to accountancy bodies seen by  The Times  , Jim Harra, the HMRC chief executive, suggested that it was unlikely that a simple appeals format would be developed by January 31, but said that no fines would be issued until the system was up and running.  “We know some taxpayers and agents will struggle to meet the deadline, especially given the current public health situation and related restrictions,” he said.  “We are carefully considering options that would significantly simplify the handling of reasonable excuse appeals for HMRC, taxpayers and agents.”  In normal times somebody who misses the deadline pays penalties for filing late and for paying late. They would be fined £100 for a delay in filing of up to three months and an additional £10 a day, up to a maximum of £900, after that. Extra payments are also due at six and 12 months. Interest of 2.6 per cent is charged on the tax owed. For paying late they would also be charged 5 per cent of tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 months.  This year, HMRC has said that fines for filing late will be waived for those with a good Covid-19 related reason, but those for paying late will not and nor will interest.  Taxpayers are being told to get in touch now if they cannot file their return or pay their bill. HMRC’s customer service is already under strain, however and waiting times have been rising since November.  More than 12 million self-employed people, landlords and those with second forms of income are expected to file by the self-assessment deadline, but 5.4 million had not done it by January 4.  The Chartered Institute of Taxation, the tax advisers’ body, said it was furious that HMRC was refusing to automatically waive all late-filing penalties, claiming that it was breaching its charter to be fair to taxpayers.  It wants HMRC to waive all penalties on tax returns until at least March 1, with no need for an appeal.  Richard Wild from the institute said: “Dealing with appeals will create even more unnecessary work for taxpayers, agents and HMRC, not to mention the additional stress and concern. We find it difficult to reconcile HMRC’s stance with its charter commitments to its customers, which include the promise of ‘being aware of your personal situation’.  “The unfortunate impression given is that there is one rule for HMRC, in that it can constantly miss its own targets, but another for taxpayers who must file on time, come what may.”  Tim Stovold from the accountancy firm Moore Kingston Smith said: “HMRC will be tying up goodness knows how many people to deal with these appeals when we know that it doesn’t have the resources to deal with day-to-day stuff. It’s a really bad call in my view.”  HMRC said: “We want to encourage as many people as possible to file on time, even if they can’t pay their tax straight away. Filing allows taxpayers to benefit from HMRC’s significantly enhanced ‘time-to-pay’ arrangement.”  What should I do if I have filed my return but can’t pay on time?  Contact the taxman. HMRC may allow you to have a time-to-pay arrangement, where you can spread payments over 12 months. There will be no fixed £100 late-filing fine, but interest of 2.6 per cent of the tax owed will still be charged. Then on March 2, if you still haven’t paid, you will get a late-payment penalty of 5 per cent of your bill.  If you do not get in touch, enforcement proceedings could involve the taxman collecting what you owe through your earnings or pension, using debt collectors to demand the money, removing items from your home using bailiffs, or even taking money from your bank account. You could also be taken to court and made bankrupt.  What if I can’t file on time?  Again, contact HMRC. It has promised leniency for people with Covid-related excuses who have not managed to file their tax returns on time, which can range from you or your accountant becoming ill to you facing extra work pressure and the stress of home schooling your children. The taxman has promised to introduce a simplified form for you to fill out, but has not done so yet. If you don’t file your return you won’t be able to set up a time-to-pay arrangement.  Can I just refuse to pay?  No — don’t bury your head in the sand. There will be penalties for the late tax return although you will be able to appeal against these if you have an excuse that is clearly linked to coronavirus.

41,660126,"During a daylong preliminary hearing in Vallejo, Judge Mike Nail listened to testimony from two police officers who were with K-9 Officer Jeff Azuar on April 12 at Teitgen's Tennessee Street home to take him into custody on a Napa County warrant for check fraud.  Officer Douglas Wilcox told how he and Azuar, 50, were let into the house by Teitgen's wife and found the suspect hiding in a downstairs laundry room.  ""He took off running in mine and Officer Azuar's direction and started toward the direction of the stairway,"" Wilcox testified to a courtroom filled with the families and friends of both the victim and the defendant. ""He basically caught me flatfooted.""  He ran past the officers, who pursued him part way up the stairs where Wilcox struggled with Teitgen, 34, with Azuar close behind.  ""As I was trying to get a carotid restraint on him, a gunshot occurred,"" Wilcox said. The officer saw Teitgen holding a revolver in his right hand and attempting to twist the gun around.  ""I believed he was trying to point it at me,"" Wilcox said. ""I was basically yelling as loud as I could to Jeff to shoot him. As I pushed the gun away, the second shot went off.""  The shot was close enough for Wilcox to feel the heat of the bullet and it allowed Teitgen to break free and run for the top of the stairs.  From there, he allegedly fired a third bullet from the .357-caliber pistol, the bullet that probably struck Azuar in the forehead.  ""I don't know if it was the second shot or the third shot,"" said Wilcox, who struggled at times to maintain his composure while answering questions from defense attorney Guy Sandler. The officer said he felt Azuar slump against him and when Wilcox stood up and turned around, he watched his fellow officer -- blood pouring from his head -- fall to the bottom of the stairs.  ""It took a long time for him to fall,"" Wilcox said. In response to a question about how Teitgen was able to wriggle out from under the officer and fire a third shot, Wilcox answered, ""I've thought about that for a long time.""  Reportedly an informant for Vallejo police, Teitgen had been using methamphetamine heavily before the arrest, investigators said. He was shot in the chest by a third officer, Sgt. Larry Rogers, as he fled the house from a second-story window. But Teitgen still managed to resist and fiercely struggled with Rogers to regain control of his pistol before officers subdued him.  Although yesterday's testimony offered the most detailed account yet of how Azuar, a 21-year veteran of the department, was killed, more questions were raised about why police decided to arrest Teitgen on a Napa County warrant that had gone unserved for five months.  Despite several objections from prosecutor George Williamson, Wilcox was allowed to tell defense attorneys that Vallejo Officer Daniel Reid had requested Teitgen's arrest on the Napa warrant even though he was not on duty the day Azuar was shot.  Reid reportedly had been tipped off to the outstanding warrant from an unidentified Vallejo resident who had allegedly been threatened by Teitgen.  But none of the officers who responded to Teitgen's house was apparently aware of his history as an informant for the department or his reputation as a drug user. Wilcox testified that both he and Azuar never drew their guns as they searched for Teitgen in the house.  Several internal investigations are under way at the department, but authorities have declined to comment about them.  But Teitgen's attorneys said that certain officers improperly handled Teitgen in his role as an informant and may have only worked to further destabilize him, making him more dangerous for the officers sent to arrest him.  ""It will be developed fully at trial,"" said defense attorney Stephen Krimel. ""I believe that it's going to be revealed that the officers who went to that home had not been made aware of extremely critical information regarding Mr. Teitgen. It was information those officers should have known about and it's a tragedy they didn't.""","After hearing graphic testimony about how a well-liked Vallejo police officer was slain while serving a warrant, a judge ruled yesterday that there is enough evidence to hold the suspect in the case over for trial.

44,251290,"'This time of year, I'm getting a lot of requests to donate money, but bills and debt payments are hanging over my head. I want to be generous. Can I give to charity anyway?'  Congratulations: You have a heart. The desire to donate comes from a place of compassion and empathy, and it's worth celebrating.  'We can't avoid being human and wanting to help others,' says Derrick Feldmann, lead researcher on the Millennial Impact Project, which studies millennials' philanthropic behavior.  Feldmann says millennials donate $200 to $300 a year on average, and closer to $400 in years when major natural disasters occur.  While you can't give money you don't have, it's possible to do your part to save the world even with, say, thousands of dollars in student loan debt. You're financially ready to give if you are:  * Earning more money than you spend  * Paying at least the minimum on your debts, on time, every time  * Saving regularly for the future in both emergency and retirement funds: That means setting aside at least $500 for unexpected expenses and contributing enough to get the company match on your 401(k) "" or saving in an individual retirement account  Once you've determined you can spare some cash for charity, follow these tips on how to do it. And if donating isn't possible this year, consider volunteering or participating in activism instead.  Build your values into your budget  Your question is about spending money on what you value most, and that's all budgeting really is. Figure out what you can spare by looking at how much is available for discretionary spending.  Using the 50/30/20 guideline, aim to spend no more than 30% of your after-tax income on wants (50% of your take-home pay goes to needs like housing, food and utilities; 20% goes to paying down debt and saving for the future). Decide how much of the 30% you want to give away. Maybe you'll decide $20 a month can go to charity.  This approach makes it easy to set up automatic recurring donations, instead of giving lump sums at the end of the year, says Elise Murphy, a certified financial planner at Level Financial Advisors in Amherst, New York. You won't feel crunched or drain your bank account in November and December, when you're also buying holiday gifts and traveling to see family.  Donate strategically  Once you've earmarked your precious cash for charity, put it to good use.  * Donate your full charitable giving budget to just one or two organizations, says Eileen Heisman, CEO of the National Philanthropic Trust. Sending $10 to 20 different organizations won't make as big an impact, because it costs money to process every donation.  If you give more to one, 'the charity will have more net money to actually devote to programs,' she says.  * Ask if your workplace matches donations, which will make your money go further.  * Keep records of your donations; you can deduct them from your taxable income if you itemize on your tax return and the organization qualifies under IRS rules. Check its eligibility using the IRS' Exempt Organizations search tool.  * Make sure you're giving to reputable organizations.

45,56473,"The report’s authors recently found interest rates as high as 14.24% on private undergraduate loans, compared to 5.05% on federal loans. They are calling on colleges and universities to do a better job of educating students about their eligibility for government-backed loans.  “Private education loans are one of the riskiest ways to pay for college,” the report argues. “Unlike federal loans, they typically have variable interest rates and lack the important borrower protections and repayment options that come with federal loans.”  The report from TICAS, an advocacy group that focuses on college affordability and availability, offers a preview of how the policy debate with respect to student loans is likely to change if Democrats take control of Congress in November.  The education finance industry has argued in recent years that the federal government, which does not consider borrowers’ ability to repay their loans, bears far more responsibility than banks do for the massive run-up in U.S. student debt.  Student debt outstanding rose from less than $800 billion in 2010 to $1.4 trillion this year. Federal loans represent more than 90% of that debt, according to industry data.  Following President Trump’s election in 2016, industry officials hoped that congressional Republicans would scale back the federal program in ways that would benefit the private sector — such as by restricting government-backed loans to parents and graduate students. Shares in SLM Corp., the student loan giant known as Sallie Mae, climbed 59% between Nov. 8 and Dec. 7, 2016.  But over the last 20 months, the GOP-led Congress has failed to enact major changes to the nation’s student loan programs.  If Democrats gain control of the House in November, they may well point to the report released Wednesday as evidence for the need to steer more borrowers into government-backed loans.  The report’s authors support legislation — introduced over the summer by Democratic Sens. Richard Durbin of Illinois, Tina Smith of Minnesota and Jack Reed of Rhode Island — that would require schools to counsel students about any unused federal student aid eligibility before they shoulder private debt.  That bill has drawn opposition from the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents the nation’s largest private student lenders, including Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo and Discover Financial Services.  “Provisions in this legislation are needed, but not for private student loans,” the trade group’s president, Richard Hunt, said in a July 16 press release. “Private loans have comprehensive, plain-language disclosures so students and their families know the full cost of their private student loan upfront. The same disclosures simply do not exist for federal loans and should.”  Banks also argue that the structure of the federal loan program — borrowers are not underwritten based on their ability to repay — contributes to fast-rising tuition bills at colleges and universities. They say that students can get federal loans even if their job prospects are likely to be poor, driving up the demand for higher education. They also maintain that student default rates have been rising as a result of the federal government’s dominant role in the market.  But in its new report, TICAS flips that criticism on its head. The nonprofit organization argues that as a result of the underwriting done by private student lenders, students from poorer families pay more than those from wealthier households.  “Regardless of whether they are fixed or variable, interest rates for these loans are typically highest for those who can least afford them,” the report states.  The report’s conclusion that 53% of private student loan borrowers in the 2015-2016 school year did not use the maximum amount available from federal loans was based on an analysis of data from the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study.  In the previous edition of that study, from the 2011-2012 academic year, 47% of private student loan borrowers did not use the full amount available from federal loans, according to Debbie Cochrane, vice president at TICAS.  Cochrane said that there are likely multiple reasons why many college students do not fully avail themselves of federal student aid.  In some cases, the student may not complete a financial aid application. In other situations, the student may receive some federal money, but later determine that the proceeds do not cover the full cost of attendance, and turn to private loans without realizing that additional federal funds could be tapped.  “When the student needs more, they just think private loans are their only option,” Cochrane said.  The report also places blame on financial aid offices at some colleges, noting that their practices vary widely. Prior to approving a loan, private lenders typically get certification from the school, verifying that the borrower is enrolled and collecting other information.  “Some colleges take care to inform students about their federal loan eligibility before certifying private loans, whereas others encourage private loan financing by including private loans in students’ award packages,” the report states.","More than half of all students who took out private education loan were eligible to borrow more from the federal government than they ultimately did, and 30% of them did not use government-backed loans at all.

Research shows that more than three million people currently working - one in 10 of the total UK workforce - have no plans to retire once they reach state pension age.

It is the rise of an army with one of those horrible mashed-up names that nevertheless conveys the meaning perfectly: the ""wellderly"".  The state pension age was designed a century ago, when average life expectancy in the UK was below 60. Although recent changes are gradually raising pensionable age, by 2020 this will be still a relatively young 66 for both men and women. Today, people can live three more decades beyond it: the number of nonagenarians has nearly tripled since 1982 (and centenarians have quadrupled over that period), and it is not only about living longer, but having a healthier older life. Thirty years is a long time to receive a smaller amount of money than you are used to, even if it means taking it easy - so why wouldn't you want to carry on with some sort of job?  Of course, some older people will be less mobile and suffer more health problems than younger workers. But the ""wellderly"" - physically and mentally fit older people - can offer a great deal to society through their experience if they keep working. In any case, staying in work might keep them more physically and socially active than in retirement. More over-60s in work would make them more visible in society, so they would be better valued by employers.  In his landmark book The Pinch: How the Baby Boomers Took Their Children's Future - And Why They Should Give It Back, published in 2010, former Conservative minister David Willetts noted that the baby boomers, who have just begun or are on the brink of retirement, own more than half of the nation's £6.7trillion wealth - a staggering amount of assets. Yet at the same time, they are benefiting more from the welfare state than any other generation: Lord Willetts calculated that people born between 1956 and 1961 will get 118 per cent more out of the welfare state than they put in.  His argument was that this inter-generational inequality is grossly unfair, and that the newly retired should give back more to society, particularly the young.

That's a 75 per cent overrun on the estimate for that particular contract when the previous B.C. Liberal government approved Site C at the end of 2014.  Overall spending on the project was $7.4 billion as of June 30 this year, suggesting another milestone is at hand. With Site C burning through more than $100 million a month, the running tab must be approaching $7.9 billion, which this time seven years ago was the all-in cost estimate for the completed project.  Now B.C. Hydro says there's another $8 billion or so still to be spent, presuming no more setbacks and no more things they just aren't telling us yet. vpalmer@postmedia.com"

51,412467,"The government has announced it is launching a consultation on ways to reduce childcare costs for parents, most notably by changing staff-to-child ratios so that each adult can look after five two-year-olds instead of four as currently permitted.  It says the move could reduce costs by up to 15% or £40 a week for a family paying £265 a week for care for a two-year-old, if providers adopt the changes and pass on all the savings. However, the figures have been questioned by the charity Pregnant Then Screwed, which described them as “nonsense”.  Purnima Tanuku, the chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), said: “From when this was first mooted, the sector has been saying that altering ratios for two-year-olds from 1:4 to 1:5 won’t make any meaningful difference to the cost of childcare for providers or parents. That can only come from the government paying the full rate for funded childcare places for children under five.  “Many children are coming into early years settings with additional needs having been impacted by Covid restrictions. More children are struggling with language acquisition and with their personal, social and emotional development as a result. This is why now is not the time to be giving young children less support.”  The proposed new ratio would bring England in line with Scotland, but Tanuku said the early years framework in Scotland was “very different in terms of qualification levels, staff training and support from their regulators”.  A study in 2013 – commissioned by the government when it was considering the policy – concluded that allowing staff members to look after more children would lead to a reduction in quality, and that there was little evidence that high fees were a result of regulatory requirements.  The government has reprised the policy as part of efforts to tackle the cost of living crisis.  Neil Leitch, the CEO of the Early Years Alliance, said: “It is beyond frustrating that the government is wasting its time consulting on relaxing ratios, rather than just admitting that if we want to have affordable, quality, sustainable care and early education in this country, we need to invest substantially more into the sector than we are doing at the moment.  “If the government wants to take lessons from other countries, maybe it should look at how much they invest in early years providers and how they respect and value the workforce. Watering down early years standards at a time when children need more support than ever is not, and never will be, the answer.”  Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant Then Screwed, said research by the charity and alliance found that only 2% of nurseries and preschools would lower fees for parents – mainly because most would not relax ratios – and even when they did the average would be about £2 a week.  She said: “We’re furious that after months and months of talking to the government, showing them data that, for two-thirds of families, childcare costs the same or more than their rent or mortgage and is pushing parents into poverty, children into poverty, they’ve come up with a proposal to change ratios that won’t reduce costs for parents but will just reduce quality.”  The government also announced plans to boost childminder numbers by granting them greater flexibility and reducing inspections, and it has launched a £1.2m campaign to encourage greater take-up of the £2,000-a-year tax-free childcare scheme and the universal credit childcare offer.  The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, said: “Every child deserves a great start in life and that means giving families the support they need. Childcare is an integral part of our economy, and these reforms prove again that this government is on the side of working families.

Less stringent rules may also put consumers in health plans that don't cover the services they need if they get sick.  ""These plans would provide many consumers with inadequate protection,"" warned Ceci Connolly, president of the Alliance of Community Health Plans, an organization of leading health insurers, including Kaiser Permanente, HealthPartners in Minnesota and UPMC Health Plan in Pennsylvania.  The association health plan regulation and a second proposal to broaden availability of short-term health plans that can also offer skimpier benefits have drawn criticism from patient advocates, physician and hospital groups, and many health insurers and state regulators.  A Washington Bureau analysis of official comments filed with federal agencies found that more than 95 percent, or 266 of 279, of the health care groups that filed comments about the proposed association health plan regulation expressed serious concern or outright opposed it.

The new regulation would prohibit these plans from turning away sick consumers or charging more to people with pre-existing medical conditions, two popular protections enacted in the 2010 health care law.

60,565605,"My brother did his best to live within his means. But a few times, he overdrew his bank account. When he did, he would berate himself.  Overdraft charges and non-sufficient-fund fees are a menace to the most financially vulnerable, like my brother. So, it's worth noting that Capital One says it's eliminating all overdraft fees and non-sufficient-fund fees for its consumer banking customers.  Could this be a trendsetting move for other big banks, which rake in the most money in overdraft fees? I certainly hope so, but if it isn't, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ought to step in.  A few other financial institutions have eliminated overdraft fees, but as Capital One pointed out, it's the nation's sixth-largest retail bank and stands alone among the top 10 banks in getting rid of the fees. Customers enrolled in overdraft protection will automatically be converted to its no-fee policy early next year. For customers not enrolled, transactions that would overdraw their account will be declined, with no fees assessed.  ""The bank account is a cornerstone of a person's financial life,"" said Capital One's founder and chief executive, Richard Fairbank, in a statement. ""Eliminating overdraft fees is another step in our effort to bring ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking.""  I was struck by Fairbank's use of the word ""humanity."" For years, consumer advocates have been critical of the abusive nature of such fees. They are menacing and inhumane.  ""Bank overdraft fees cause particular harm to low-income consumers and communities of color, who are already disproportionately excluded from the banking mainstream,"" said a 2020 report from the Center for Responsible Lending. While the typical overdraft fee is $35, the report said, ""the cost to the bank of processing an overdraft transaction, particularly in today's highly automated environment, is very low.""  Think about this.  The most common transactions that generate an overdraft fee involve the use of a debit card. And those transactions are only $20 on average, according to the center's report. The report also pointed out the tricks of this trade that can trigger overdraft fees even when people are trying to be careful to avoid them.  One practice is imposing overdraft fees on debit card transactions that were authorized when consumers had enough money in their accounts. But by the time the bank settles the transaction, the customer might not have sufficient funds.  Or this fee-generating strategy cited in the report: ""Banks have notoriously re-ordered transactions to drive up the number of overdraft fees incurred; if larger balances are posted first, the account is depleted more quickly, resulting in more transactions for which the bank charges overdraft fees.""  Overdraft fees or the fear of them are keeping millions of Americans outside the banking system, leaving many to be preyed upon by payday loan companies or rent-to-own establishments. Or they end up paying unnecessary fees to cash checks. This is what my brother did before I persuaded him to open a bank account.  In the U.S., an estimated 7.1 million households, or 5.4%, were ""unbanked"" in 2019, meaning that no one in the household had a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union, according to a report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Lower-income and minority populations are disproportionately represented among unbanked households. Nearly 14% of Black and 12% of Hispanic households are unbanked, compared with 2.5% of white households, according to the FDIC.  The CFPB released a report in 2017 that found many consumers who get hit with overdraft fees tend to carry low balances and have relatively low monthly deposits. It then promised to escalate the study of the fees, a move that could have led to stronger consumer protections.  But under the Trump administration, the CFPB, then led by former congressman Mick Mulvaney, backed away from a rulemaking plan to address bank overdraft-fee abuses.  The Biden administration can't leave it up to the banking industry as a whole to do what Capital One did, because the money is too good for them to do the right thing.","I know the damage bank overdraft fees can do to a person's finances and self-worth.

In the U.S., an estimated 7.1 million households, or 5.4%, were ""unbanked"" in 2019, meaning that no one in the household had a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union, according to a report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Lower-income and minority populations are disproportionately represented among unbanked households. Nearly 14% of Black and 12% of Hispanic households are unbanked, compared with 2.5% of white households, according to the FDIC.  The CFPB released a report in 2017 that found many consumers who get hit with overdraft fees tend to carry low balances and have relatively low monthly deposits. It then promised to escalate the study of the fees, a move that could have led to stronger consumer protections.  But under the Trump administration, the CFPB, then led by former congressman Mick Mulvaney, backed away from a rulemaking plan to address bank overdraft-fee abuses.  The Biden administration can't leave it up to the banking industry as a whole to do what Capital One did, because the money is too good for them to do the right thing."

62,113809,"The iconic rock 'n' roll star rented the midcentury modern house for about a year starting in 1966, and he and his then-wife, Priscilla, celebrated there following their Las Vegas wedding the following year. The house is a Palm Springs landmark, long drawing tourists, Elvis fanatics and architecture lovers.  The sellers of the four-bedroom house are Seattle-based investors Dan Bridge and Paul Armitstead. Mr. Bridge, 68, said he is a rabbi who has worked in the nonprofit sector, and Mr. Armitstead, 67, is an architect who has designed apartment communities. The men are former brothers-in-law (Mr. Bridge used to be married to Mr. Armitstead's sister) and have been co-investing for several years in house revamps in Seattle and Palm Springs, Mr. Bridge said.  They first visited the property three or four years ago for an event held as part of Palm Springs' Modernism Week, an annual festival for architecture lovers, Mr. Bridge said. With its round walls and batwing-shaped roof, it reminded Mr. Bridge of a stealth bomber.  ""It looked like it was ready to take off,"" he said.  The roughly 4,700-square-foot home dates to around 1960, when it was designed by architect William Krisel, a Modernist architect known for his California tract homes, according to the Palm Springs Historic Site Preservation Board. The house essentially has no corners. Rather, its peanut-brittle-style stone walls curve around circular rooms, according to the sellers. In the living room, a roughly 60-foot-long, rounded built-in couch hugs the walls and surrounds a central fireplace. Outside, there is a pentagon-shaped pool, although the original tennis court no longer exists.  The story goes that Elvis and Priscilla Presley were set to marry at the house, but shifted their ceremony to Las Vegas after a local gossip columnist got wind of their plans. They returned to the home after the ceremony on Frank Sinatra's Learjet and Elvis carried Priscilla over the threshold singing ""The Hawaiian Wedding Song,"" according to the book, ""And the Rest Is History: The Famous (and Infamous) First Meetings of the World's Most Passionate Couples"" by Marlene Wagman- Geller. Ms. Presley's spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.  The house was built as a personal residence for home builder Bob Alexander and his family, according to the preservation board. Mr. Alexander's firm, the Alexander Construction Company, built thousands of homes in Palm Springs and was responsible for most of the modern homes in the surrounding neighborhood, which is known as Vista Las Palmas.  At the time of its completion, the house was dubbed ""The House of Tomorrow"" and seen as a harbinger of a new era in modern design, with its electronic controls to manipulate the temperature, outside lights and sprinkler systems, according to a 1962 article in ""Look"" magazine. The magazine ran a spread on Mr. Alexander and his wife, Helene Alexander, and their cutting-edge home, calling it a ""$300,000 pleasure dome that proves California has only begun to show how luxurious things can be on this planet.""  The article portrayed the Alexanders as the ultimate Palm Springs ""It"" couple,"" at a time when the area was seeing an influx of wealthy buyers from L.A. In the mornings, the story said, Ms. Alexander would spend an hour putting on her false eyelashes and mascara, then head off to the racquet club, which was popular with movie stars, for a tennis lesson, which ""firms her legs."" In the evening, it was ""parties, parties, parties."" The Alexanders died in a plane crash a few years after the home was completed.  When Messrs. Bridge and Armitstead first saw the house during Modernism Week a few years ago, it had the look of a museum stocked full of Elvis memorabilia, Mr. Bridge said. The previous owner, Boston-based investor M.L. Lewis, was an Elvis superfan and maintained the property as a kind of time capsule, offering guided tours given by docents in Elvis and Priscilla costumes.  Mr. Bridge said he and Mr. Armitstead were overwhelmed by the memorabilia but saw potential in the house. At the time, the property had been on the market since 2014 asking $9.5 million, but they thought the price was too high. After a string of price cuts, they eventually pounced, buying it for $2.6 million in December 2020, records show. They didn't even return to see it again in person, Mr. Bridge said.  The pair's decision was driven by the architecture of the home as opposed to the Elvis connection, Mr. Bridge said, noting that neither he nor Mr. Armitstead is an Elvis devotee. The Elvis memorabilia, which included furnishings and framed Elvis photographs, movie posters and costumes, was removed and auctioned by the previous owner, they said.  ""I grew up as a big soul music fan and I appreciate Elvis, but I am not an Elvis groupie,"" Mr. Bridge said.  The two embarked on a lengthy renovation, which was slowed by the city's push in 2021 to designate the home as a historic landmark. They rebuilt the kitchen, replaced the round island in the center and modernized the fixtures and finishes. They replaced the windows and cleaned the exposed-rock walls. They refurbished the built-in sofa. The lack of right angles in the home meant nearly every countertop and fixture had to be custom-made, Mr. Bridge said.  They worked with the city to secure the historic designation, which required returning the home to its original exterior color by working with the 1960s paint supplier. They removed a fifth bedroom, which had been an illegal addition, he said, and restored the carport that had been originally attached to the home.  They also tore up the pool decking because it had been poured over the original plumbing and gas lines, which had galvanized and rusted and were no longer serviceable.  Mr. Bridge said he hasn't yet tallied up the total cost of the renovation and admitted he is a little scared to do so. He said it was always the plan to sell the house once the renovation was completed.  ""Our goal in this was not to have a museum, but rather turn this into a living and breathing home for people who will live in it, not just use it as a showpiece,"" he said.

His name is also being wiped off the fund, as the assets will be handed to BlackRock and Park Hill to sell off – instead it will be re-named the ""LF Equity Income Fund"".

Read the latest | Woodford thrown off flagship fund  Why is it being wound up now?  The suspension from 3 June 2019 was supposed to protect those who had kept their money in the fund after a flood of investors pulled their cash.  Link also considered other options, including extending the period of suspension and merging the fund with another fund. However, it concluded that these options would either not be in the best interests of investors or are not viable.  The suspension was supposed to give Woodford time to reposition the fund’s portfolio into more liquid investments. This would have allowed the fund, upon lifting of the suspension, to meet requests from investors to exit.  It had been agreed that suspension should only be lifted when the sale of its unlisted and less liquid listed assets was complete.  Link's note said while there has been progress to reposition the fund's portfolio, it has ""not been sufficient to allow reasonable certainty"" as to when the fund could be re-opened.  Will I get my cash back?  Link said that cash will be returned to investors at the “earliest opportunity”, and that the move was designed to protect them.  Investors do not have to take any action right now – this is what they can expect.  Money will be returned through interim payments to investors more quickly than if the fund had remained suspended for a longer period of time. This will be done through an “orderly” sale of assets to avoid a ""fire sale"" and maximise returns for investors.  After it has taken account of any liabilities which the fund owes, and of the costs incurred in the winding up, a process will begin of paying each individual's share of the proceeds from the sale of assets as soon as possible.  It is uncertain when this will happen, but investors will get regular updates.  The amount investors will get shall depend on the Equity Income fund’s value and the amount raised by selling its assets.

The fund has been raking in around £65,000 a day in fees from investors .  The administrator, Link, revealed today it will not take its fee for acting as authorised corporate director from the point of suspension. If there is a surplus after paying all other fees, Link will return this to the fund.  Investors will not be charged a direct fee during the winding-up process.  In the run-up to that process, there will be no change to the periodic charge paid by the Equity Income fund to Link. Out of this, Link will pay BlackRock’s fees, as well as those of the fund’s depositary, administrator, custodian and auditor.  Brokerage and legal costs, including the costs of Park Hill, associated with selling the assets in Portfolio B will continue to be borne by the fund.  Investors should beware that these costs will be greater during this period than they were typically in previous periods due to the requirement to sell all the assets.

64,745944,"Have you ever seen one of those behemoth shredders? They’re nearly as big as a municipal trash truck. The good ones (the ones we use) have cameras, allowing you to watch the shredding taking place. They come to our office and demolish 20 or 30 boxes in a half hour or less.  Why watch the shredding process? Is it really better than TV? Not really. It’s a security measure we take when shredding sensitive client records. They contain enough information to allow for identity theft. That’s why we don’t have them pick up the records to shred later (an optional service). If you use a service to do your shredding, it’s important that you watch the process until it’s done. Otherwise, do it yourself.  The cost of using these mobile shredding services tends to be about $100 for the first few boxes, then about $5 or $10 for subsequent boxes. If you don’t have a ton of your own trash, consider inviting your friends, neighbors or business colleagues to share the truck and bring all the boxes to a central location — your office building, school, church, or social hall. This can be a great fundraiser and community clean-up event.  Don’t destroy tax returns  Never destroy copies of your tax returns or proof that you paid any balance due. If possible, keep both an electronic copy and hard copy of your returns. They don’t take up that much room. You can fit 10 to 20 years of tax-return files into one or two 12” x 15” cardboard storage boxes.  Why say “never” on tax returns? After all, the IRS may audit you only for up to three years after you file, right? Well, not so right. If there is an error of 25% or more on your return, the IRS may audit for up to six years. When it comes to certain other errors, there may be no statute of limitations. States tend to have a longer open window because they assess taxes after an IRS audit.  Another problem that crops up often enough to consider is that government agencies lose tax records. TaxMama® hears from taxpayers who have been hounded by the IRS or their state for not having filed a return in a year when they know they have filed. Without a copy of the tax return from 10 years ago, how can you prove you’ve already filed and paid?  Speaking of states, people have become more mobile. Our jobs and careers often have us working in more than one state. More states have started implementing the Jock Tax concept. Read more: The long arm of states' tax laws.  Why should you care? If you worked in a state several years ago and never filed a tax return, the statute of limitations has never closed. The same thing applies to partners in a partnership, LLC or S corp, where the business has income in several states. When you don’t file a tax return to report income from the entity (whether publicly traded or privately held), the states can come after you forever.  How does having a copy of the tax return for that year help? Most state tax returns start with the federal information and give you credit for your federal itemized deductions. So you don’t have to work as hard to prepare those unfilled state returns when the states demand you file.  Save property records  One of the big nightmares many people face is how to establish the basis (tax cost) of an asset held for decades when they sell it. This applies to real estate, stocks, retirement accounts, insurance policies, collectibles, etc. Keep all purchase records, improvement receipts, reinvestment records — and anything else related to the ownership of your assets.  Even if you don’t organize your files, if you keep all the records in one place, you can sort them out when necessary. Better yet, try to keep the records organized, at least minimally. Use expandable files, labeled with each asset or asset type. Then, just drop papers into the file.  Save loan records  Doesn’t it feel great when you pay off a loan? Especially a mortgage. But when I see people on TV having a “burn the mortgage” celebration, I cringe. What if you need to prove you paid it off, years later? The Recorder’s office does make errors. Or the bank may fail to file the final paperwork with the appropriate government or credit agency. Keep copies of major loans and their payoffs — real estate, vehicles, student loans, lawsuit payoffs, long-term credit-card balances, personal loans, family loans, etc.  Those records are also helpful when you need to prove that you made a particular payment. The very first time I shredded records (after keeping everything for over 20 years), I discovered that I’d destroyed the proof of a loan owed to me by a former boyfriend. Fortunately, he paid every dime, so we didn’t need to end up before Judge Judy.  Keep warranties  Warranties and service records have a variety of terms. They will provide parts and labor in the initial years after purchase. But some will provide longer-term support for the more expensive materials in computers, furniture, appliances, etc. They will also provide model numbers and valuable contact information to the company so you can get replacement parts, even after the warranty has expired.  Disaster strikes  If you live in a disaster-prone area, consider keeping copies online of important personal and business records — and irreplaceable family photos. You won’t have to struggle to reconstruct anything after your local earthquake, flood, fire or hurricane.  What can we toss?  It sounds as if you must keep everything. Not so. After four to seven years, you can shred all of your bank records and credit-card records.  You can shred personal utility bills after a year or two. And business or rental utility bills after four to seven years.  Sort through the correspondence that you’ve saved. Aside from precious letters and cards, you can shred all correspondence that is unrelated to those must-save items above.  Definitely stop saving all the junk mail related to things you might buy someday. Toss the old magazines, unless they are collector’s items (like the Playboy issue about Hugh Hefner’s wedding to Crystal Harris, which was called off, alas). You can re-read those articles online.  Do you need all your old, out-dated reference materials? We finally tossed more than 25 years of IRS and California tax books. The IRS has 1913 to the present on one single disk. These materials were unreasonably difficult for me to relinquish. What are you holding on to from your profession that is now available on a single disk?

LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — The end of the year is a great time to clean house, and to remove the detritus and accumulation of another year. What about tax returns or financial records? That’s one of the common questions that comes to TaxMama®. My instinctive response always is: never!

Yet the big shredder truck is coming to our office to destroy records. We are destroying hard-copy client records that are five years or older. We did ask our clients if they wanted copies before turning them into confetti. Naturally, we have electronic copies of key files.
Have you ever seen one of those behemoth shredders? They’re nearly as big as a municipal trash truck. The good ones (the ones we use) have cameras, allowing you to watch the shredding taking place. They come to our office and demolish 20 or 30 boxes in a half hour or less.  Why watch the shredding process? Is it really better than TV? Not really. It’s a security measure we take when shredding sensitive client records. They contain enough information to allow for identity theft. That’s why we don’t have them pick up the records to shred later (an optional service). If you use a service to do your shredding, it’s important that you watch the process until it’s done. Otherwise, do it yourself.  The cost of using these mobile shredding services tends to be about $100 for the first few boxes, then about $5 or $10 for subsequent boxes. If you don’t have a ton of your own trash, consider inviting your friends, neighbors or business colleagues to share the truck and bring all the boxes to a central location — your office building, school, church, or social hall. This can be a great fundraiser and community clean-up event.  Don’t destroy tax returns  Never destroy copies of your tax returns or proof that you paid any balance due. If possible, keep both an electronic copy and hard copy of your returns. They don’t take up that much room. You can fit 10 to 20 years of tax-return files into one or two 12” x 15” cardboard storage boxes.  Why say “never” on tax returns? After all, the IRS may audit you only for up to three years after you file, right? Well, not so right. If there is an error of 25% or more on your return, the IRS may audit for up to six years. When it comes to certain other errors, there may be no statute of limitations. States tend to have a longer open window because they assess taxes after an IRS audit.  Another problem that crops up often enough to consider is that government agencies lose tax records. TaxMama® hears from taxpayers who have been hounded by the IRS or their state for not having filed a return in a year when they know they have filed. Without a copy of the tax return from 10 years ago, how can you prove you’ve already filed and paid?  Speaking of states, people have become more mobile. Our jobs and careers often have us working in more than one state. More states have started implementing the Jock Tax concept. Read more: The long arm of states' tax laws.  Why should you care? If you worked in a state several years ago and never filed a tax return, the statute of limitations has never closed. The same thing applies to partners in a partnership, LLC or S corp, where the business has income in several states. When you don’t file a tax return to report income from the entity (whether publicly traded or privately held), the states can come after you forever.  How does having a copy of the tax return for that year help? Most state tax returns start with the federal information and give you credit for your federal itemized deductions. So you don’t have to work as hard to prepare those unfilled state returns when the states demand you file.  Save property records  One of the big nightmares many people face is how to establish the basis (tax cost) of an asset held for decades when they sell it. This applies to real estate, stocks, retirement accounts, insurance policies, collectibles, etc. Keep all purchase records, improvement receipts, reinvestment records — and anything else related to the ownership of your assets.  Even if you don’t organize your files, if you keep all the records in one place, you can sort them out when necessary. Better yet, try to keep the records organized, at least minimally. Use expandable files, labeled with each asset or asset type. Then, just drop papers into the file.  Save loan records  Doesn’t it feel great when you pay off a loan? Especially a mortgage. But when I see people on TV having a “burn the mortgage” celebration, I cringe. What if you need to prove you paid it off, years later? The Recorder’s office does make errors. Or the bank may fail to file the final paperwork with the appropriate government or credit agency. Keep copies of major loans and their payoffs — real estate, vehicles, student loans, lawsuit payoffs, long-term credit-card balances, personal loans, family loans, etc.  Those records are also helpful when you need to prove that you made a particular payment. The very first time I shredded records (after keeping everything for over 20 years), I discovered that I’d destroyed the proof of a loan owed to me by a former boyfriend. Fortunately, he paid every dime, so we didn’t need to end up before Judge Judy.  Keep warranties  Warranties and service records have a variety of terms. They will provide parts and labor in the initial years after purchase. But some will provide longer-term support for the more expensive materials in computers, furniture, appliances, etc. They will also provide model numbers and valuable contact information to the company so you can get replacement parts, even after the warranty has expired.  Disaster strikes  If you live in a disaster-prone area, consider keeping copies online of important personal and business records — and irreplaceable family photos. You won’t have to struggle to reconstruct anything after your local earthquake, flood, fire or hurricane.  What can we toss?  It sounds as if you must keep everything. Not so. After four to seven years, you can shred all of your bank records and credit-card records.  You can shred personal utility bills after a year or two. And business or rental utility bills after four to seven years.  Sort through the correspondence that you’ve saved. Aside from precious letters and cards, you can shred all correspondence that is unrelated to those must-save items above.  Definitely stop saving all the junk mail related to things you might buy someday. Toss the old magazines, unless they are collector’s items (like the Playboy issue about Hugh Hefner’s wedding to Crystal Harris, which was called off, alas). You can re-read those articles online.  Do you need all your old, out-dated reference materials? We finally tossed more than 25 years of IRS and California tax books. The IRS has 1913 to the present on one single disk. These materials were unreasonably difficult for me to relinquish. What are you holding on to from your profession that is now available on a single disk?  While you’re at it, if you happen to run across old letters from friends, perhaps you can scan them and send a copy to your friends. They might enjoy the memories.

66,20576,"Once the federal government assigns Baby No. 3 her nine-digit identifier sometime after she's born, Malchow and her husband will open another tax-advantaged education savings account under the Nebraska Education Savings Trust program.  Known better by the acronym and federal tax code chapter under which ""qualified tuition programs"" are exempt from taxation, NEST 529 plans continue to grow in popularity as millennials — roughly, those born between 1981 and 1997, who now comprise the largest living generation in the U.S. — begin to start families of their own.  Collective balances of NEST 529 accounts are up $300 million since August and stand at $4.8 billion, according to First National Bank of Omaha, which administers the program for the Nebraska state treasurer. Balances have more than doubled since December 2010 when First National took over administration duties, and the number of active accounts is up about 40 percent since then to 355,000. Today, about 16 percent of Nebraska families participate in the plans, compared with 11 percent in 2010.  An amendment to the federal tax package that recently made its way through Congress may open the door for even more growth.  The Student Opportunity Amendment allows 529 plans to be used for private and religious schools for kindergarten through 12th grades.  Deborah Goodkin is managing director of savings plans including NEST 529 at First National and says the act would be ""a big change.""  She declined to speculate on just how much of an influx of new savings the change may bring in, but said she anticipates a bill to be introduced in the upcoming Nebraska legislative session to square up state law with federal tax law.  ""Nebraska has a lot of kids going to parochial schools, especially in the eastern part of the state,"" Goodkin said.  In Nebraska, about 11 percent of the state's roughly 357,000 students were enrolled in nonpublic institutions in the fall of the 2016-2017 school year. That's slightly more than the 10 percent figure nationally, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.  Even though the plans' $10,000 annual withdrawal limit most likely wouldn't cover full payment of tuition at local private schools — annual tuition at Omaha religious schools can cost anywhere from $10,000 to more than $20,000 — multiple accounts for individual students could provide a tax shelter for some.  But it could be more trouble than it's worth, said Paul von Hippel, an assistant professor in the Lyndon B. Johnson School for Public Affairs at the University of Texas-Austin.  Von Hippel said the shorter-term investment timeline for primary and secondary education doesn't match up with the longer-term design of 529 plans.  A family that puts away $100 a month as soon as a child is born would save about $50,000 by the time the child is 18, assuming a healthy return of 8 percent. Dipping into that account any sooner would thwart returns.  That means any tax benefits sought by private-school parents plopping $10,000 in every year (that's the maximum income tax deduction allowed for such plans in Nebraska) would maybe be ""a few hundred dollars,"" von Hippel said.  ""Necessarily, if you're using these for elementary school, you'll be taking out money sooner than if you're using them for secondary school, and sooner than for college,"" von Hippel said. ""As a result, the tax benefits are smaller.""  President Donald Trump signed the tax overhaul on Friday.  Meanwhile, some Nebraskans who have been socking away money in 529 plans have other things on their minds.  ""The biggest concern is that it's easy to think 'We're so far ahead, but will it be enough?' "" said Malchow, 27, an account director at Omaha-based marketing firm OBI Creative.  Her concern is well-founded: Student loan debt has increased more than fivefold over the past 14 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and at $1.36 trillion, it constitutes the second-largest class of household debt behind mortgage debt at $8.74 trillion. That puts loan balances for things like course credits, books and room and board ahead of credit card debt and mortgage debt.  As those costs continue to rise, Shannon Wallace said her concern (or hope) is getting her 15-year-old son, Ted Wagner, through an undergraduate program without taking on any student loan debt. Wallace has been saving money in a NEST 529 account since Ted was about 5 years old.  Now a freshman at Elkhorn South High School, Ted only recently learned that his parents — and grandparents, aunts and uncles — have been contributing to his higher education expenses since before he started kindergarten in 2007.  ""A lot of times when Ted was little, he didn't know he got money, so being the mom, I just threw it in the NEST account,"" Wallace said.  Those contributions in addition to an automatic deduction out of Wallace's paycheck, plus investment returns over about 10 years, have ""doubled"" the investment in the Elkhorn South student's 529 plan over time, Wallace said.  And lately there's been yet another contributor to the student's future college education.  ""Now that he's older, he'll put some in savings and then give me some to put in the NEST account,"" Wallace said.

68,1453734,"The key change, that most retirees with defined contribution pension savings will no longer have to buy an annuity for their retirement income but instead be able to pull down money from their pot, was seen as a mortal blow to the companies providing annuities and their share prices plummeted.  Yet amid the panic there was widespread support for the changes. Giving greater flexibility over how savers get their pension money has been lauded.  Firstly, it frees retirees from the underwhelming returns offered on annuities - the products that take your retirement savings in return for providing a guaranteed income for life.   Returns on these had fallen and even pension savings of £100,000 would only give an annual income of a few thousand pounds.  Secondly, it has raised hopes that workers will become more enthusiastic about saving into a pension in general. Committing money from their pay packet will feel less like losing it into a black hole if they can get it back flexibly and in a tax efficient way when they retire.  However, the months since the Budget have seen concerns grow that a disorderly rush will commence when the reforms take effect next April.   The risk is that savers are left disappointed that the flexibility doesn't live up to the promises of ministers, or worse that many will make irrevocable mistakes handling their money.  Why are the experts so worried - and should you be too?  Retirees will spend their money too quickly  This was jumped upon as soon as the reforms were announced and can be regarded as the 'Lamborghini' issue - that retirees will take all the money set aside for their retirement and blow it on a sports car, or other frivolities.  Steve Webb, pensions ministers, said at the time he was 'relaxed' about this possibility, insisting that anyone doing this would at least be exercising a free choice.  Additionally, ministers argue that a new flat-rate state pension that will provide a new higher baseline income (although smaller than the maximum currently on offer) from 2016 means the safety net is a bit bigger if the money does run out.  But that hasn't stopped the warnings that some will end up blowing their pension pots as soon as they can lay hands on them at 55..  Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: 'At age 55 people have 30 years of active life ahead of them.  'We have an environment where the state retirement age is rising, where people are being encouraged to work for longer. Yet the communication around the Budget reforms is focussed on access to cash at age 55.'  Savers will get investing decisions wrong  The new flexibility means that many people who have never had to engage with the world of investing will be required to do so.   Those with decent a level of savings will be able to get professional advice from an independent financial adviser, but those with less may struggle.  Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Millions of pension savers are being encouraged to withdraw their money at will.   'This is fine as far as it goes, but managing longevity and investment risk is complicated, particularly if you have been defaulted into a pension, you’ve never engaged with it and you don’t know what you’re doing.  'Many professionals struggle to get it right so the idea that at least some inexperienced investors won’t get it wrong is recklessly naïve.'  Faced with having to make investments that can provide an income, inexperienced investors may be tempted into 'guaranteed' products or 'smoothed' investments that make promises to reduce risk. However, these can add fees.  'You can ""insure"" an investment fund to protect it from falls in capital or income', McPhail said. 'These guarantees are very expensive. Typically the guarantee alone costs more than the whole of the charge cap for auto-enrolment workplace pensions. So they could more than double pension charges.'  'Investors may be persuaded to hand their money over to investment experts, who will promise to smooth out the investment and longevity risks for them. A few will succeed, many will fail.'  One predicted result of retirees getting their hand on their pension pots is a surge of money spent on residential property. As well as giving aspiring buy-to-let investors access to money they can lay down against a house, the reforms may also offer a way out for interest-only mortgage borrowers who face having to sell because they don't have savings enough to clear their loan at the end of their term.  Others will see their children struggling to get a foot on the ladder and decide their pension money is best spent giving them a hand.    The reforms will not live up to expectations  This is perhaps the biggest unanswered question regarding the flexibility - will pension companies actually allow savers to use it?  Briefing around the legislative changes today has described how those over 55 will be able to use their pension 'like a bank account'. The Government is removing restrictions on scheme rules so that savers will be able to leave the money where it is when they retire, then use the flexibilty to draw down money as they wish.  The problem is that pension schemes have never had to accommodate withdrawals in this way.   They have been used to providing savers with a lump sum soon after they reach retirement, then transferring the rest to either an annuity or drawdown provider.   Providing regular withdrawals, let alone the flexibility of bank accounts, will be a huge undertaking.  Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and a Government adviser on older people, told the Daily Mail: ‘Currently, most pension companies are not ensuring that their customers can take money out flexibly. I call on the industry to make sure people can really benefit from the new changes as quickly as possible.’  It is unclear what charges scheme operators will level to provide this and it seems inevitable that many will simply tell savers to transfer their pot to a different provider.  Alan Higham, retirement director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: 'There's a big risk that people will want to use the flexibility but be shocked at the cost of it.

Today the pension reforms that were announced so unexpectedly in the Budget were set out before parliament in the Taxations on Pensions Bill.

The changes had not been consulted upon before Chancellor George Osborne unveiled them in April and they left the pensions industry scrambling to catch up.
The key change, that most retirees with defined contribution pension savings will no longer have to buy an annuity for their retirement income but instead be able to pull down money from their pot, was seen as a mortal blow to the companies providing annuities and their share prices plummeted.  Yet amid the panic there was widespread support for the changes. Giving greater flexibility over how savers get their pension money has been lauded.  Firstly, it frees retirees from the underwhelming returns offered on annuities - the products that take your retirement savings in return for providing a guaranteed income for life.   Returns on these had fallen and even pension savings of £100,000 would only give an annual income of a few thousand pounds.  Secondly, it has raised hopes that workers will become more enthusiastic about saving into a pension in general. Committing money from their pay packet will feel less like losing it into a black hole if they can get it back flexibly and in a tax efficient way when they retire.  However, the months since the Budget have seen concerns grow that a disorderly rush will commence when the reforms take effect next April.   The risk is that savers are left disappointed that the flexibility doesn't live up to the promises of ministers, or worse that many will make irrevocable mistakes handling their money.  Why are the experts so worried - and should you be too?  Retirees will spend their money too quickly  This was jumped upon as soon as the reforms were announced and can be regarded as the 'Lamborghini' issue - that retirees will take all the money set aside for their retirement and blow it on a sports car, or other frivolities.  Steve Webb, pensions ministers, said at the time he was 'relaxed' about this possibility, insisting that anyone doing this would at least be exercising a free choice.  Additionally, ministers argue that a new flat-rate state pension that will provide a new higher baseline income (although smaller than the maximum currently on offer) from 2016 means the safety net is a bit bigger if the money does run out.  But that hasn't stopped the warnings that some will end up blowing their pension pots as soon as they can lay hands on them at 55..  Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers, said: 'At age 55 people have 30 years of active life ahead of them.  'We have an environment where the state retirement age is rising, where people are being encouraged to work for longer. Yet the communication around the Budget reforms is focussed on access to cash at age 55.'  Savers will get investing decisions wrong  The new flexibility means that many people who have never had to engage with the world of investing will be required to do so.   Those with decent a level of savings will be able to get professional advice from an independent financial adviser, but those with less may struggle.  Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'Millions of pension savers are being encouraged to withdraw their money at will.   'This is fine as far as it goes, but managing longevity and investment risk is complicated, particularly if you have been defaulted into a pension, you’ve never engaged with it and you don’t know what you’re doing.  'Many professionals struggle to get it right so the idea that at least some inexperienced investors won’t get it wrong is recklessly naïve.'  Faced with having to make investments that can provide an income, inexperienced investors may be tempted into 'guaranteed' products or 'smoothed' investments that make promises to reduce risk. However, these can add fees.  'You can ""insure"" an investment fund to protect it from falls in capital or income', McPhail said. 'These guarantees are very expensive. Typically the guarantee alone costs more than the whole of the charge cap for auto-enrolment workplace pensions. So they could more than double pension charges.'  'Investors may be persuaded to hand their money over to investment experts, who will promise to smooth out the investment and longevity risks for them. A few will succeed, many will fail.'  One predicted result of retirees getting their hand on their pension pots is a surge of money spent on residential property. As well as giving aspiring buy-to-let investors access to money they can lay down against a house, the reforms may also offer a way out for interest-only mortgage borrowers who face having to sell because they don't have savings enough to clear their loan at the end of their term.  Others will see their children struggling to get a foot on the ladder and decide their pension money is best spent giving them a hand.    The reforms will not live up to expectations  This is perhaps the biggest unanswered question regarding the flexibility - will pension companies actually allow savers to use it?  Briefing around the legislative changes today has described how those over 55 will be able to use their pension 'like a bank account'. The Government is removing restrictions on scheme rules so that savers will be able to leave the money where it is when they retire, then use the flexibilty to draw down money as they wish.  The problem is that pension schemes have never had to accommodate withdrawals in this way.   They have been used to providing savers with a lump sum soon after they reach retirement, then transferring the rest to either an annuity or drawdown provider.   Providing regular withdrawals, let alone the flexibility of bank accounts, will be a huge undertaking.  Ros Altmann, a pensions expert and a Government adviser on older people, told the Daily Mail: ‘Currently, most pension companies are not ensuring that their customers can take money out flexibly. I call on the industry to make sure people can really benefit from the new changes as quickly as possible.’  It is unclear what charges scheme operators will level to provide this and it seems inevitable that many will simply tell savers to transfer their pot to a different provider.  Alan Higham, retirement director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment, said: 'There's a big risk that people will want to use the flexibility but be shocked at the cost of it. Pensions were never set up to be bank accounts and the reality is that many can't and won't operate that way.  'There is an unfolding reality around the level of flexibility that those retiring next April will benefit from. To access the full flexibility, people may have to move their pensions and moving isn't easy; it also has costs and some risks of error.  'Taking your pensions savings as cash is fine but only once you have secured enough income for life. This has to be thought through.'

Average U.S. FICO® Score At 716, Indicating Improvement In Consumer Credit Behaviors Despite Pandemic  Ethan Dornhelm wrote: The FICO® Score is the lingua franca, or common language, for the credit scoring industry. It serves as a broad-based, independent standard measure of credit risk. It is relied upon by stakeholders across the entire lending ecosystem - from regulators, investors and boards to consumers, lenders, and brokers - as a baseline metric for assessing credit risk that is fair to both lenders and consumers.  Each year, we share the average U.S. FICO® Score, which now stands at 716. This is eight points higher than it was one year ago, and five points higher than the last time we reported on the average FICO Score in October 2020. At that time, the news that the FICO Score had trended up in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic was greeted with some surprise. But there is considerably less surprise about these latest results: the data shows that a growing economy, accompanied by historic home price appreciation, strong performance of equity markets, and evidence that the payment accommodation programs offered by lenders since the onset of the pandemic have helped (and are continuing to help) affected borrowers bridge the gap that opened up in their finances as a result of COVID-related income loss.  Figures 1. National Average FICO® Score Has Continued to Rise Through the Pandemic; FICO Score® Distribution Shows Similar Trend Towards Higher Scores  Though it might sound obvious, the drivers of the continued improvement in the average FICO® Score are continued improvements in key metrics considered by the score: fewer missed payments, lower consumer debt levels, and reduced credit seeking behavior. Let's dive into each of these in a bit more depth:  * Missed payments reported in the credit file are down significantly. As of April 2021, just 15% of the population has had a 30+ day past due missed payment in the past year. This is down from 19.6% as of April 2020. As shown in figure 3, recent missed payments are down across key product types. While millions of U.S consumers have experienced disruption to their income since the onset of the pandemic, the combination of government stimulus programs such as the CARES Act and payment accommodation programs being offered by lenders continues to enable many consumers to avoid falling behind on their bills. Staying up-to-date on your bills can have a substantial and positive impact on your FICO® Scores. In fact, this 'payment history' dimension of the credit file represents some 35% of the overall FICO Score calculation.  * Consumer debt levels are decreasing. The uncertainty brought on by COVID-19, coupled with the fact that consumers simply had fewer opportunities to engage in discretionary spending during the lockdown phase of the pandemic, had a material impact on consumers' willingness and ability to spend. Mix in the fact that many consumers - enabled, in part, by historic levels of savings at least partly driven by government stimulus such as enhanced unemployment benefits - have shifted their focus to paying down their credit card debt, and the result is a greater than 10% decrease in the average credit card balance and utilization of the U.S. consumer. ""Amounts owed"" comprises some 30% of the overall FICO® Score calculation and is heavily weighted towards credit card balances and utilization---so the observed reduction in credit card debt is helping to drive scores upwards.  * Fewer consumers are actively seeking credit. There has been a 12.1% year-over-year decrease in the average number of hard credit inquiries in consumers' credit files. Hard credit inquiries represent instances where a credit file was requested by a lender in response to a consumer-initiated application for credit. This dip in credit seeking behavior likely goes hand-in-hand with the renewed consumer focus on reducing spending and paying down debt. The ""new credit"" dimension of the FICO® Score represents ~10% of the overall score calculation.

In a new blog series called FICO Fact, FICO experts dive into the common misconceptions surrounding FICO® Scores. In the first post of the series addressing whether minimum scoring criteria limits the consumers' access to credit, Joanne Gaskin wrote: Simply put, the answer is no. Over the last 30 years, FICO has continued to analyze the minimum amount of credit bureau data that is necessary to deliver a reliable, predictive FICO® Score to the market - which benefits both consumers and lenders alike.  As a reminder, we have found that at least 6 months of credit history, as well as data reported within the past 6 months, is required in order to best ensure that the consumer's current financial position is sufficiently reflected. Our research has consistently found that models that rely solely on sparse and/or outdated credit information are less reliable at forecasting future performance.  Diving in a bit deeper, this means that, unlike with other scores in the market, consumers that just opened their first trade line, such as a credit card, would not be eligible for a FICO® Score before they have ever made a single payment. A payment history of at least 6 months is necessary to derive a consistently predictive and reliable credit score. At any time, there are approximately 2.5M consumers that have recently opened a credit account, but don't yet have the necessary 6 months of repayment experience in order to obtain a FICO Score based solely on traditional credit bureau data. Allowing consumers to build their credit repayment history over six months before assigning them a FICO Score will result in a consistently more accurate assessment of their credit risk, and with it, confidence by lenders to extend credit to these consumers at more favorable terms.  Delivering less predictive and often low scores to the market using only sparse and/or stale credit bureau data is not a recipe for helping consumers gain access to credit. FICO has found the answer to supporting lenders in identifying credit ready consumers is to augment traditional credit bureau data with FCRA compliant alternative data such as telecom, utilities, public record, and checking account data to provide a predictive and reliable score that lenders can use to responsibly expand access to credit.

Joanne Gaskin wrote: The unequivocal answer is yes! FICO® Scores have always considered telco and utility payment data that is furnished to the three nationwide U.S. credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. The inclusion of telco and utility payment information dates back to the release of the very first FICO Scores in 1989.  The next natural question is: how much of this data is available at the three nationwide credit bureaus? The answer is that while the availability of this data has been increasing, it remains far below other tradeline data such as credit cards, auto loans or mortgages. For example, in the US, 92 percent of consumers have cell phones, but just 5 percent of consumers have telco data reported in their traditional credit bureau files.

Joanne Gaskin wrote: While the FICO® Score has been trusted by consumers, lenders and investors for decades, the data that goes into a FICO® Score can be as recent as a payment reported by your lender today.  When a FICO® Score is pulled, say, when a consumer applies for a loan or credit card, the most up-to-date information available at the credit bureaus is used to calculate the score. In fact, while other credit scoring models may generate a credit score based on stale credit information, our minimum scoring criteria requires that at least one credit account has updated information reported in the last six months.  How frequently the data is updated depends on where it resides:  Credit Bureau Data  FICO® Scores use data from the three main credit bureaus. This data is updated by thousands of data furnishers, usually on a monthly basis. It's generally monthly because most loans (auto loans, mortgages, credit cards, etc.) are billed on a monthly cycle. As a result, these accounts are generally reported to the bureaus on a monthly cycle with information being reported each day of the month by different furnishers. Then, when a FICO® Score is pulled, it reflects the most up-to-date data reported to the credit bureaus. That information may have been reported to the credit bureaus as recently as that very same day.  Alternative Data  Some FICO® Scores use alternative data, which is predictive, regulatory-compliant and found outside of the credit bureau file maintained by the credit bureaus. Telco and utility payment data, similar to credit bureau data is generally reported on a monthly basis.

More Than 232 Million Us Consumers Can Be Scored By The FICO Score Suite  Based on the 2020 US Census, the US credit-eligible population (those over 18 years of age) is 258 million people. But how many of those consumers can obtain a FICO® Score?  Calculations by FICO data scientists indicate that more than 232 million US consumers can be scored by the FICO® Score suite. That is 90% of the credit-eligible US population.  For most of the credit-eligible US population there is sufficient traditional credit bureau data available for calculating a FICO® Score. However, some 28 million consumers have minimal data available in their traditional credit bureau files, and another 25 million are 'credit invisible' and have no traditional credit bureau data at all. An independent study conducted by the CFPB reached very consistent conclusions to our own, sizing the 'credit invisible' population at 26 million consumers. As shown in Figure 1, the profiles of these consumers that lack sufficient traditional credit bureau data can be quite varied.  To responsibly and reliably score consumers with sparse or no traditional credit bureau data requires a novel approach to credit scoring. Over the past decade, FICO has been developing innovative new scores - like FICO® Score XD and the UltraFICO™ Score - which augment traditional credit bureau data with rich alternative data, such as telecom, utilities, public record, and checking account data.

Top 5 Scores Topics of 2021
In 2021, the financial services world continued to grapple with the uncertainty brought on by year two of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the continued concerns, we were encouraged to see the growth of the average U.S. FICO® Score, as stated in our top post of the year. Other top FICO Scores posts explored the expansive reach of the FICO® Score suite, as well as dispelling common misconceptions surrounding FICO® Scores.  Average U.S. FICO® Score At 716, Indicating Improvement In Consumer Credit Behaviors Despite Pandemic  Ethan Dornhelm wrote: The FICO® Score is the lingua franca, or common language, for the credit scoring industry. It serves as a broad-based, independent standard measure of credit risk. It is relied upon by stakeholders across the entire lending ecosystem - from regulators, investors and boards to consumers, lenders, and brokers - as a baseline metric for assessing credit risk that is fair to both lenders and consumers.  Each year, we share the average U.S. FICO® Score, which now stands at 716. This is eight points higher than it was one year ago, and five points higher than the last time we reported on the average FICO Score in October 2020. At that time, the news that the FICO Score had trended up in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic was greeted with some surprise.

Scores are also used to determine which apartments you can rent, which cell phone plans you can get and, in most states, how much you pay for auto and homeowners insurance.

87,865282,"My parents recall the good old days when savings bonds made the best Christmas gifts. When my dad was around eight years old during the early 1960s, his grandfather gave him his first $100 bond. Although foggy on the details, he distinctly remembers thinking it seemed almost magical that money could increase over time. It was kind of magical - in the early 1980s, you could count on government savings bonds paying rates as high as 19.5%.  But as popular as government savings bonds were during the First and Second World War eras and into my father's adolescence as a safe, secure way to save money, these bonds are now considered the laughing stock of the fast-paced investing world. Investors sneer at these bonds for one simple reason - the painfully low interest rates that are now barely able to keep up with inflation at around 2%. Factoring in tax along with fluctuating interest rates and inflation, growth over a long term period could be minimal.  Since interest rates are at an alltime low as we roll into 2012, with Canadian Premium bonds paying a measly 1% annual interest rate provided you lock in for one year and Canada Savings Bonds offering an even lower yield to maturity at 0.65%, are government bonds a viable option for people with low income? Jason Heath, financial consultant for E.E.S. Financial Services Ltd., believes there are better plans out there to build up your nest egg.  Sorry dad.  (Both doctors, my parents always say asking them for financial advice is like asking a banker for a medical analysis.)  Nearly 3.8 million Canadians invest in CSBs or their premium cousin purchased through banks or payroll savings programs, but the amount of money invested continues to steadily drop along with interest rates themselves. The Investment Funds Institute of Canada says bond funds net sales totalled $938.9-million by June 2011, plummeting from $3.50-billion during the same period just a year earlier.  Decisions to invest really depend on assessing risk. Mr. Heath notes that although investors might not have earned a hefty return from their government bonds in 2011, those who opted to invest in stocks suffered a blow with the TSX down 11% that year.  ""You might as well have put the money under your mattress and been better off at the end of the day,"" he jokes.  But before young investors rush into any plans, Mr. Heath says they need to take a step back and think about what they want to do with the money.  ""Whether you are young or old, the money should be tied to a specific goal,"" he explains.

But like many young, financially illiterate adults, I knew little about bonds, apart from the fact that my relatives think they make good gifts as an alternative to giving cash.
My parents recall the good old days when savings bonds made the best Christmas gifts. When my dad was around eight years old during the early 1960s, his grandfather gave him his first $100 bond. Although foggy on the details, he distinctly remembers thinking it seemed almost magical that money could increase over time. It was kind of magical - in the early 1980s, you could count on government savings bonds paying rates as high as 19.5%.  But as popular as government savings bonds were during the First and Second World War eras and into my father's adolescence as a safe, secure way to save money, these bonds are now considered the laughing stock of the fast-paced investing world. Investors sneer at these bonds for one simple reason - the painfully low interest rates that are now barely able to keep up with inflation at around 2%. Factoring in tax along with fluctuating interest rates and inflation, growth over a long term period could be minimal.  Since interest rates are at an alltime low as we roll into 2012, with Canadian Premium bonds paying a measly 1% annual interest rate provided you lock in for one year and Canada Savings Bonds offering an even lower yield to maturity at 0.65%, are government bonds a viable option for people with low income? Jason Heath, financial consultant for E.E.S. Financial Services Ltd., believes there are better plans out there to build up your nest egg.  Sorry dad.  (Both doctors, my parents always say asking them for financial advice is like asking a banker for a medical analysis.)  Nearly 3.8 million Canadians invest in CSBs or their premium cousin purchased through banks or payroll savings programs, but the amount of money invested continues to steadily drop along with interest rates themselves. The Investment Funds Institute of Canada says bond funds net sales totalled $938.9-million by June 2011, plummeting from $3.50-billion during the same period just a year earlier.  Decisions to invest really depend on assessing risk. Mr. Heath notes that although investors might not have earned a hefty return from their government bonds in 2011, those who opted to invest in stocks suffered a blow with the TSX down 11% that year.  ""You might as well have put the money under your mattress and been better off at the end of the day,"" he jokes.  But before young investors rush into any plans, Mr. Heath says they need to take a step back and think about what they want to do with the money.  ""Whether you are young or old, the money should be tied to a specific goal,"" he explains.  And if that goal is to move out of your parents' house or purchase a car within the next five years, and you don't have ample time to wait for your bonds to mature, then the financial consultant recommends exploring the more conservative option of low-interest bonds tucked into a tax-free savings account.

That could place the companies in which you invest at greater risk.  Pokie manufacturer Aristocrat Leisure was producing so much cash before 2007 that share buybacks and dividends became excessive. But when the boom turned to bust, the company's wasted research and development expenditure was exposed and earnings crumbled. You can guess what happened next.

89,18592,"U.S. Attorney's Office February 21, 2014  Southern District of New York (212) 637-2600  Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced that Peter J. Lesniewski, a Board-certified orthopedist, was sentenced today in Manhattan federal court to eight years in prison for his role in the alleged massive fraud scheme in which Long Island Railroad (LIRR) workers claimed to be disabled upon early retirement so that they could receive disability benefits to which they were not entitled. Between 1999 and 2008, Lesniewski provided fraudulent medical narratives in support of the disability applications of at least 230 LIRR employees. In all, over 98 percent of the more than 400 LIRR employees he supposedly treated received disability benefits after seeing Lesniewski. Following a three-week jury trial, Lesniewski was convicted on August 6, 2013, on all 10 counts with which he was charged, including one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, wire fraud, and health care fraud; one count of conspiracy to defraud the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB); three counts of health care fraud; and five counts of mail fraud.  Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said, ""In perpetrating this elaborate scheme, Dr. Lesniewski compromised both his professional and his personal integrity. Regrettably, Dr. Lesniewski is one of a number of health care professionals whose gross misconduct has depleted the RRB's funds and diverted benefits from the rightful beneficiaries of its disability program.""  According to the complaint, the superseding indictments, the evidence at trial, and statements made in court:  The LIRR Disability Fraud Scheme  The RRB is an independent U.S. agency that administers benefit programs, including disability benefits, for the nation's railroad workers and their families. A unique LIRR contract allowed employees to retire at the relatively young age of 50--the age of eligibility has since changed to 55--if they had been employed by the LIRR for at least 20 years. Eligible employees are entitled to receive an LIRR pension, which is a portion of the full retirement payment for which they are eligible at 65. In addition, at full retirement age (between age 60 and age 65 depending on years of service), they are eligible to receive an RRB retirement pension. LIRR workers who retired at 50 with only an LIRR pension would receive less than their prior salary and substantially lower pension payments than those to which they would be entitled at full retirement age. However, LIRR employees who retired and claimed disability could receive a disability payment from the RRB on top of their LIRR pension, regardless of age. A retiree's LIRR pension, in combination with RRB disability payments, can be roughly equivalent to the base salary earned during his or her career.  Hundreds of LIRR employees have allegedly exploited the overlap between the LIRR pension and the RRB disability program by pre-planning the date on which they would falsely declare themselves disabled so that it would coincide with their projected retirement date. These false statements, made under penalty of prosecution in disability applications, allowed LIRR employees to retire as early as age 50 with an LIRR pension, supplemented by the fraudulently obtained RRB disability annuity. From 1995 through 2011, more than 75 percent of retiring LIRR employees stopped working and began receiving RRB disability benefits, whereas during this same period, only 25 percent of retiring Metro-North employees stopped working and began receiving RRB disability benefits.  Lesniewski was instrumental in helping LIRR retirees receive disability benefits to which they were not entitled. As part of the massive fraud scheme, Lesniewski prepared false documentation purporting to show the LIRR employees' steady decline toward disability exactly at the time they pre-planned their retirement. He then provided to those LIRR employees a narrative for submission to the RRB that claimed they should receive a disability annuity. These medical narratives were completely fabricated or grossly exaggerated so that Lesniewski could recommend a set of restrictions that, if legitimate, would render it impossible for the LIRR employees to continue performing their jobs. Many of the purportedly ""objective"" findings from the tests he conducted showed nothing more than normal degenerative changes one would expect to see in patients within the relevant age bracket.  Lesniewski received approximately $1,000, often in cash, for these fraudulent assessments and narratives, and hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional health insurance payments for unnecessary medical treatments. In turn, the 242 patients who obtained disability benefits with Lesniewski's assistance have received approximately $70 million in RRB disability benefit payments. In sentencing LESNIEWSKI, Judge Marrero found that the total intended losses from his fraud were over $90 million and that the actual losses suffered by the RRB and insurance companies to date total over $70 million.  * * *  In addition to his prison term, Lesniewski, 63, of Rockville Centre, New York, was also sentenced to three years of supervised release. He was also ordered to forfeit $70,947,699 and pay $70,632,900 in restitution.  Thirty-three people have been charged in connection with the LIRR disability fraud scheme, 28 of whom have pled guilty and five of whom were convicted after trial.  Mr. Bharara praised the Railroad Retirement Board's Office of the Inspector General, the FBI, and the Metro Transit Authority's Office of the Inspector General for their outstanding work in the investigation, which he noted is ongoing. He also acknowledged the previous investigation conducted by the New York State Attorney General's Office into these pension fraud issues.  The Office's Complex Frauds Unit is handling the case.

My conclusion from the report is that with no public sector pension to look forward to and higher taxes ahead, I should save more, and in places that offer the most protection from the taxman. That means Isa saving rather than pension saving, as pension income is taxed.  andrew.oxlade@telegraph.co.uk"

For term deposits, the promise is that everyone gets the Surrey-based credit union's best rates.

Customers with large term deposit amounts have traditionally been able to negotiate preferential rates, although McCurdy noted in an interview that most limit themselves to no more than $100,000 in any one account, because that's the maximum protected by government deposit insurance if the institution goes belly up.

96,1398735,"He was in hospital, suffering from the brain tumour which caused his death less than two months later, when he was alleged to have made a will leaving everything he owned to a longstanding friend and confidante. His siblings, who would have inherited his estate as his next of kin had he died without making a will, launched proceedings challenging the document's validity.  The Court found that the will was duly executed. Arguments that the man was so unwell that he would have been unable to hold the pen used to sign the document were rejected. Also finding that he had the mental capacity required to make a valid will, the Court noted that treatment with steroids had at the relevant me brought a temporary improvement in his condition.  The beneficiary and one of the two witnesses to the will had in some respects acted in an underhand manner. They had provided the impetus for making the will and they had concealed what they were doing from the man's brother. There was, however, no suggestion that they had brought undue influence to bear and the Court was satisfied that the will ultimately reflected the man's true wishes.  Upholding the will's validity, the Court found that the man's intention was to benefit the group of friends that he considered his family. Although he was in the grip of progressive brain damage due to the tumour, he was able to understand and approve the simple contents of the will. The document was read to him and he probably read it through himself, as best he could, before signing it.  Gardiner v Tabet & Anr.(2020]ewhc 1471 (Ch)Davey & Anr v Bailey & Ors [2021] EWHC 445 (Ch). In another case the wishes of the deceased were not able to be fulfilled. In a devoted couple had built up considerable wealth during their marriage. Each of them had made wills leaving everything to the other. However, the documents were about a decade old when the wife died from cancer. The grief-stricken husband later suffered a fatal heart attack and survived the wife by only about four months. The wife's estate passed to the husband in accordance with her will. After she died, he made an appointment with a solicitor with a view to making a new will. No such will was executed prior to his death, however. The wife no longer being alive to inherit his estate, the husband died intestate. The end result was that all the couple's assets passed to the husband's next of kin and the wife's family received nothing. The wife's brother and sister launched proceedings on the basis that the couple had given them substantial parts of their respective estates shortly before they died. The gifts were said to be enforceable deathbed gifts in that they had been made by the couple in contemplation of their imminent deaths. Ruling on the matter the Court noted that both husband and wife were devoted to their respective families, which were closely intertwined. The evidence indicated that it was highly likely that the couple intended that both their families should benefit substantially from their estates. In rejecting the claim, however, the Court found that the strict criteria which must be met before a deathbed gift can be legally binding had not been fulfilled. The Court expressed considerable sympathy for the wife's family, who had effectively been disinherited. However, there was nothing to prevent them receiving voluntary gifts from the husband's estate if his family chose to make them.

Making a will when you are close to death and without professional assistance is an effective means of fostering dispute between your loved ones after you are gone. As a High Court case strikingly showed, that is particularly so if you intend to leave your estate outside your immediate family.

The case concerned an exceptionally intelligent man whose life had been blighted by mental health difficulties. He was eloquent and talkative and had built his life around friendships formed with lodgers in his substantial home. His complex and difficult personality had led to estrangement from his brother and sister, although contact resumed between them in the weeks and months before his death.
He was in hospital, suffering from the brain tumour which caused his death less than two months later, when he was alleged to have made a will leaving everything he owned to a longstanding friend and confidante. His siblings, who would have inherited his estate as his next of kin had he died without making a will, launched proceedings challenging the document's validity.  The Court found that the will was duly executed. Arguments that the man was so unwell that he would have been unable to hold the pen used to sign the document were rejected. Also finding that he had the mental capacity required to make a valid will, the Court noted that treatment with steroids had at the relevant me brought a temporary improvement in his condition.  The beneficiary and one of the two witnesses to the will had in some respects acted in an underhand manner. They had provided the impetus for making the will and they had concealed what they were doing from the man's brother. There was, however, no suggestion that they had brought undue influence to bear and the Court was satisfied that the will ultimately reflected the man's true wishes.  Upholding the will's validity, the Court found that the man's intention was to benefit the group of friends that he considered his family. Although he was in the grip of progressive brain damage due to the tumour, he was able to understand and approve the simple contents of the will. The document was read to him and he probably read it through himself, as best he could, before signing it.  Gardiner v Tabet & Anr.(2020]ewhc 1471 (Ch)Davey & Anr v Bailey & Ors [2021] EWHC 445 (Ch). In another case the wishes of the deceased were not able to be fulfilled. In a devoted couple had built up considerable wealth during their marriage. Each of them had made wills leaving everything to the other. However, the documents were about a decade old when the wife died from cancer. The grief-stricken husband later suffered a fatal heart attack and survived the wife by only about four months. The wife's estate passed to the husband in accordance with her will. After she died, he made an appointment with a solicitor with a view to making a new will. No such will was executed prior to his death, however. The wife no longer being alive to inherit his estate, the husband died intestate. The end result was that all the couple's assets passed to the husband's next of kin and the wife's family received nothing. The wife's brother and sister launched proceedings on the basis that the couple had given them substantial parts of their respective estates shortly before they died. The gifts were said to be enforceable deathbed gifts in that they had been made by the couple in contemplation of their imminent deaths. Ruling on the matter the Court noted that both husband and wife were devoted to their respective families, which were closely intertwined. The evidence indicated that it was highly likely that the couple intended that both their families should benefit substantially from their estates. In rejecting the claim, however, the Court found that the strict criteria which must be met before a deathbed gift can be legally binding had not been fulfilled. The Court expressed considerable sympathy for the wife's family, who had effectively been disinherited. However, there was nothing to prevent them receiving voluntary gifts from the husband's estate if his family chose to make them.

99,891706,"SEE ALSO: 10 Best Financial Benefits for Military Families  But servicemembers have access to special savings opportunities that aren't available to most people, so it's important to take advantage of these programs while you can.  Many servicemembers overlook the importance of saving because they hope to retire from the military after 20 years and receive pension income for life. However, fewer than 18% of servicemembers stay long enough to qualify for military retirement pay. The rest get nothing.  Unlike civilian jobs, there is no partial vesting under the current system if you leave before 20 years. Even if you do end up getting the pension, your retirement income could be as little as 50% of your base pay (more if you stay longer than 20 years), leaving you to fill in the gaps yourself. And major changes are coming soon to the military retirement system, which will provide new opportunities for servicemembers who don't stay for 20 years. But the new system could also reduce your lifetime income and make it even more important to save on your own. Because of these changes, many servicemembers will need to make key decisions about their financial futures in 2018.  No matter which retirement system you choose, it's essential to save on your own, too. The younger you are when you start setting aside money for your future, the easier it will be to build a healthy nest egg. While you are in the military, you can take advantage of special investing programs and tax breaks to help you supercharge your savings--even if you can only afford to set aside a little money now. It's up to you to make the most of your options.  Begin With the Thrift Savings Plan  The government's Thrift Savings Plan is a great place to start saving. Members of the military can invest in this tax-advantaged retirement savings plan for federal employees, which is similar to a private company's 401(k) plan but with extremely low fees. You can invest up to $18,000 in the TSP in 2016, and even more if you're receiving tax-free income while deployed--boosting the limit to $53,000 this year.  The TSP provides valuable tax advantages, no matter how much you can afford to invest, and a new rule gives you the option to take the tax breaks now or build up tax-free income for the future.  If you choose to make traditional contributions, the money you set aside reduces your taxable income now and grows tax-deferred until retirement. For example, contributing $10,000 cuts your take-home pay by just $7,500 if you're in the 25% federal tax bracket (even less if your contributions also escape state income tax).  Alternatively, you now have the option to make Roth TSP contributions, which don't provide a tax break now but do let you withdraw the money tax-free in retirement. This is similar to a Roth IRA but without any income limits to block contributions. (Note that contributions from tax-free pay in a combat zone will never be taxed.)  With either version of the TSP, your contributions can grow significantly over the years if you start early. Say you contribute $300 each paycheck to a traditional TSP. Your take-home pay will only shrink by $225 if you are in the 25% tax bracket. And if you start at age 25 and contribute for the next 30 years, you could end up with more than $900,000 by the time you're 55! Even if you leave the military at age 40 after 15 years of contributions and never add another dime to your TSP account, you could still end up with about $700,000 by age 55. These examples assume your investments return 8% per year, which has been a typical average for long-term investments.  As mentioned above, if you forego the tax break on your contributions now and instead contribute to the Roth version of the TSP, your withdrawals will be totally tax-free in retirement. If your taxable income is lower now than it will be in the future, you'll come out ahead with the Roth.  SEE ALSO: 8 Smart Financial Moves to Make in 2017 If You're in the Military  ""For most people relying primarily on military income, the Roth is generally the way to go,"" says Patrick Beagle, a certified financial planner in Springfield, Va., who is also a former helicopter pilot who retired from the Marines and specializes in helping military families with their finances. ""They are generally in the lowest bracket they will ever be in, because of all of the non-tax compensation.""  Take Advantage of Low-Cost Investing  You have several low-cost investing options in the TSP. You can choose from five index mutual funds investing in large companies, small firms, international firms, bonds or government securities.  Or you can choose a lifecycle fund (called the L fund), which builds a diversified portfolio of the other funds to match your time horizon. The fund invests primarily in stock funds at the start, when you have more than a decade before you plan to tap the money. And it gradually becomes more conservative as your retirement date draws near. Choosing the L fund is an easy way to invest.  Expenses for all of the funds are extremely low--about 29 cents a year for every $1,000 invested--making the TSP one of the lowest-cost investing options available. For a $100,000 portfolio, for example, you'd pay just $29 a year in investment management fees.  You can keep the money in the TSP after you leave the military, or you can roll it into an IRA or another employer's 401(k), where it will continue to grow tax-deferred. Just be aware that if you take the money from a traditional TSP and spend it, you could face an immediate tax bill. What's more, you'll generally face a 10% penalty if you withdraw the money from the account before age 59 ½ (unless you leave your job after age 55).  See tsp.gov for more information and a calculator to help you project your future account balance and see the power of long-term compounding of earnings.  An extra incentive to save: If you're having a tough time putting aside money for retirement, consider that your contributions can also earn you an extra tax break. The Retirement Savings Contribution Credit is worth 10% to 50% of the first $2,000 you contribute for the year to the TSP, an IRA or another retirement savings plan. The lower your income, the higher your credit.  It's worth $1,000 per person at the lowest income levels. But it drops to $200 if you are near the cutoff--$30,500 for single filers; $45,750 for filing head of household; or $61,000 if married filing jointly. These limits are based on adjusted gross income, which doesn't include your tax-free housing allowance or any tax-free pay received while in a combat zone.  Tax-Free Earnings From a Roth IRA  A Roth IRA can be a great way for anyone to supplement their retirement savings--you generally don't get a tax break for Roth contributions, but you can withdraw your earnings tax-free in retirement (and can withdraw contributions at any time without taxes or penalties). And deployed servicemembers get an extra perk: If you're receiving tax-free pay in a combat zone, your money goes into the Roth tax-free, and your contributions as well as your earnings come out tax-free in retirement.  You can contribute up to $5,500 to a Roth IRA in 2016 (or $6,500 if you're 50 or older) as long as your modified adjusted gross income is less than $117,000 for single filers, or $184,000 if married filing jointly. (The opportunity to make contributions gradually phases out as income rises above those levels.)  SEE ALSO: Why You Need a Roth IRA  You can open a Roth IRA with a brokerage firm, mutual fund company, credit union or bank. When selecting an IRA administrator, look for low fees and a range of investment choices. If you have 20 or 30 years until retirement, it's usually best to invest the money in a diversified portfolio of mutual funds. (See the Investor Protection Trust's series of investor education booklets for more information about creating a portfolio.)  Note that you can invest the maximum in both a Roth IRA and the Thrift Savings Plan in the same year. And you have until April 15 of the following year to make an IRA contribution (or a few days later if the 15th falls on a weekend). For example, April 17, 2017, is the deadline for 2016 contributions.  Finally, if you have a spouse who doesn't earn income, you can contribute to an IRA on his or her behalf. And children who earn income from a job also can contribute to a Roth IRA, which can be a great way to get them started saving for the future.  Guaranteed Return on Savings  It sounds almost too good to be true--10% interest guaranteed. But in this case it's no scam: The military's Savings Deposit Program lets servicemembers invest up to $10,000 in the program each time they are deployed. You receive 10% annual interest, compounded quarterly, and can keep the money in the account while you're deployed and up to three months after you return.  For more information, see the SDP page at the Defense Finance and Accounting website.  What You Need to Know About the New Retirement System  You may need to make a major decision about your financial future in 2018 because the military is introducing a new retirement system.  While the new system reduces the guaranteed income available after 20 years, it provides matching contributions to your Thrift Savings Plan, which you can keep after just two years of service. Your options depend on the year you entered the military.  Before 2006. If you joined the military before January 1, 2006, you're covered under the original system. You need to stay for at least 20 years to qualify for the military pension, which can be worth 50% (more if you stay longer) of your basic pay. See the section below for more information about how retirement pay is calculated.  From 2006 to 2017. If you joined from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2017, then you'll need to make a big choice. You can stay with the old system, or you can sign up for the new ""blended retirement system"" that reduces your pension but also provides matching Thrift Savings Plan contributions. (The timing for members of the Reserves is based on the number of retirement points.)  After 2018. If you join on January 1, 2018, or later, you'll automatically be enrolled in the blended retirement system.  Take Our Quiz: Test Your Retirement IQ  How Is the System Changing?  Under the current military retirement system, you'll receive income for life if you serve for 20 years or longer. Your retirement pay, which starts right away, is based on 2.5% times the number of years you served times your retired base pay (generally calculated by averaging the highest 36 months of basic pay). This works out to be 50% of your retired base pay if you stay for 20 years, and more if you stay longer. The payouts are adjusted each year for the cost of living.  The new system changes the formula to figure retirement income as 2% times the number of years served times your retired base pay. This works out to 40% of your base pay at 20 years. (Note that both systems adjust payouts for the cost of living.)  But under the new system, you'll also get something if you leave before then. The Department of Defense will automatically contribute 1% of your basic pay to the Thrift Savings Plan after 60 days of service. It will also match your contributions up to the next 4% of your pay. That's up to 5% each year in free money that you can keep in your plan (along with the earnings) after completing two years of service.  You may also receive a cash bonus after 12 years of service, in return for a commitment of four more years of service, called ""continuation pay.""  As with any TSP contributions, the money grows tax-deferred for the future (or tax-free in a Roth TSP). In addition, you generally can't withdraw money from the TSP while you are still in the service, and will need to pay a 10% penalty for withdrawals before age 59½.  For more information about the new system, see the Department of Defense's Blended Retirement System Web page. You'll find information and FAQs (including special calculations for members of the Reserves) and other resources.  You'll have from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, to opt in. If you don't do anything, you'll remain in the current retirement system.  How Do You Choose?  If you don't plan to stay for 20 years, then you'll come out ahead with the blended retirement system. If you're not sure whether or not you'll be staying, it pays to do the math. Estimate what your monthly income is likely to be under the old and new pension system, and figure out how much you'd need to save in the TSP to make up the difference.  ""We're doing some analysis to understand the probability of retirement and if they can save enough to make up for the gap,"" says Josh Andrews, a certified financial planner and advice director for Military Life for USAA, and former Air Force pilot.  If you choose the blended system, be sure to contribute at least the 5% needed to get the full match in your Thrift Savings Plan; otherwise, you're giving up free money. Under either system, it helps if you can afford to contribute even more--the more money you contribute when you're young, the longer it has time to grow and the less you'll need to set aside later to reach the same goals.

SEE ALSO: 10 Best Financial Benefits for Military Families  But servicemembers have access to special savings opportunities that aren't available to most people, so it's important to take advantage of these programs while you can.  Many servicemembers overlook the importance of saving because they hope to retire from the military after 20 years and receive pension income for life. However, fewer than 18% of servicemembers stay long enough to qualify for military retirement pay. The rest get nothing.  Unlike civilian jobs, there is no partial vesting under the current system if you leave before 20 years. Even if you do end up getting the pension, your retirement income could be as little as 50% of your base pay (more if you stay longer than 20 years), leaving you to fill in the gaps yourself. And major changes are coming soon to the military retirement system, which will provide new opportunities for servicemembers who don't stay for 20 years. But the new system could also reduce your lifetime income and make it even more important to save on your own. Because of these changes, many servicemembers will need to make key decisions about their financial futures in 2018.  No matter which retirement system you choose, it's essential to save on your own, too. The younger you are when you start setting aside money for your future, the easier it will be to build a healthy nest egg. While you are in the military, you can take advantage of special investing programs and tax breaks to help you supercharge your savings--even if you can only afford to set aside a little money now. It's up to you to make the most of your options.  Begin With the Thrift Savings Plan  The government's Thrift Savings Plan is a great place to start saving. Members of the military can invest in this tax-advantaged retirement savings plan for federal employees, which is similar to a private company's 401(k) plan but with extremely low fees. You can invest up to $18,000 in the TSP in 2016, and even more if you're receiving tax-free income while deployed--boosting the limit to $53,000 this year.  The TSP provides valuable tax advantages, no matter how much you can afford to invest, and a new rule gives you the option to take the tax breaks now or build up tax-free income for the future.  If you choose to make traditional contributions, the money you set aside reduces your taxable income now and grows tax-deferred until retirement. For example, contributing $10,000 cuts your take-home pay by just $7,500 if you're in the 25% federal tax bracket (even less if your contributions also escape state income tax).  Alternatively, you now have the option to make Roth TSP contributions, which don't provide a tax break now but do let you withdraw the money tax-free in retirement. This is similar to a Roth IRA but without any income limits to block contributions. (Note that contributions from tax-free pay in a combat zone will never be taxed.)  With either version of the TSP, your contributions can grow significantly over the years if you start early. Say you contribute $300 each paycheck to a traditional TSP. Your take-home pay will only shrink by $225 if you are in the 25% tax bracket. And if you start at age 25 and contribute for the next 30 years, you could end up with more than $900,000 by the time you're 55! Even if you leave the military at age 40 after 15 years of contributions and never add another dime to your TSP account, you could still end up with about $700,000 by age 55. These examples assume your investments return 8% per year, which has been a typical average for long-term investments.  As mentioned above, if you forego the tax break on your contributions now and instead contribute to the Roth version of the TSP, your withdrawals will be totally tax-free in retirement. If your taxable income is lower now than it will be in the future, you'll come out ahead with the Roth.  SEE ALSO: 8 Smart Financial Moves to Make in 2017 If You're in the Military  ""For most people relying primarily on military income, the Roth is generally the way to go,"" says Patrick Beagle, a certified financial planner in Springfield, Va., who is also a former helicopter pilot who retired from the Marines and specializes in helping military families with their finances. ""They are generally in the lowest bracket they will ever be in, because of all of the non-tax compensation.""  Take Advantage of Low-Cost Investing  You have several low-cost investing options in the TSP. You can choose from five index mutual funds investing in large companies, small firms, international firms, bonds or government securities.  Or you can choose a lifecycle fund (called the L fund), which builds a diversified portfolio of the other funds to match your time horizon. The fund invests primarily in stock funds at the start, when you have more than a decade before you plan to tap the money. And it gradually becomes more conservative as your retirement date draws near. Choosing the L fund is an easy way to invest.  Expenses for all of the funds are extremely low--about 29 cents a year for every $1,000 invested--making the TSP one of the lowest-cost investing options available. For a $100,000 portfolio, for example, you'd pay just $29 a year in investment management fees.  You can keep the money in the TSP after you leave the military, or you can roll it into an IRA or another employer's 401(k), where it will continue to grow tax-deferred. Just be aware that if you take the money from a traditional TSP and spend it, you could face an immediate tax bill. What's more, you'll generally face a 10% penalty if you withdraw the money from the account before age 59 ½ (unless you leave your job after age 55).  See tsp.gov for more information and a calculator to help you project your future account balance and see the power of long-term compounding of earnings.  An extra incentive to save: If you're having a tough time putting aside money for retirement, consider that your contributions can also earn you an extra tax break. The Retirement Savings Contribution Credit is worth 10% to 50% of the first $2,000 you contribute for the year to the TSP, an IRA or another retirement savings plan. The lower your income, the higher your credit.  It's worth $1,000 per person at the lowest income levels. But it drops to $200 if you are near the cutoff--$30,500 for single filers; $45,750 for filing head of household; or $61,000 if married filing jointly. These limits are based on adjusted gross income, which doesn't include your tax-free housing allowance or any tax-free pay received while in a combat zone.  Tax-Free Earnings From a Roth IRA  A Roth IRA can be a great way for anyone to supplement their retirement savings--you generally don't get a tax break for Roth contributions, but you can withdraw your earnings tax-free in retirement (and can withdraw contributions at any time without taxes or penalties). And deployed servicemembers get an extra perk: If you're receiving tax-free pay in a combat zone, your money goes into the Roth tax-free, and your contributions as well as your earnings come out tax-free in retirement.  You can contribute up to $5,500 to a Roth IRA in 2016 (or $6,500 if you're 50 or older) as long as your modified adjusted gross income is less than $117,000 for single filers, or $184,000 if married filing jointly.

The Gypsy King called out Derek Chisora on social media on Monday, claiming that a contract has been sent for a prospective trilogy bout between the pair.  Fury, who retired after his victory over Dillian Whyte in April, has now posted a video where he is seen with his new coach Isaac Lowe, and talks about hoping to make history with Chisora.  When asked by someone off camera why he has come back to boxing he said: 'I've decided to come to boxing because I can be the first heavyweight champion in history to have two trilogies - one with Deontay Wilder and a second with Derek Chisora.  'I always said I would fight Derek Chisora at the end of my career and here we are breaking all records again.'  He then revealed he chose Lowe to be his new coach, after the pair previously worked together when Fury was trained by Peter Fury, Ben Davison and SugarHill Steward.  He said: 'Why I have chosen Isaac Lowe as my trainer as when I was with Peter, Isaac was there, when I was with Ben, Isaac was always there, and when I was with SugarHill, Isaac's always been there.  'He's always given me information, he knows me better than anybody on the planet and we're a great team - we've always been together and we're going to finish this out together.  'We've always worked very well together and here we are about to take on a massive, massive, massive event.'  Isaac added: 'I'm looking forward to it, it's a new challenge for me and I've been with you all your career and think can put something new together. Looking forward to it, it's a tough task but something to look forward to go forward.'  Fury beat Chisora via unanimous decision in their first bout at Wembley Arena in July 2011.  They fought again at the ExCel Arena in November 2014, when Fury was again victorious after Chisora's corner pulled him out at the end of the tenth round.  Fury sent a message to Chisora on Monday, in which he said: 'This one goes out to Derek the s**thouse Chisora, you're running from the trilogy.  'You call yourself war but you should yourself chicken, because you're running from a trilogy for a career-highest payday. Get the f***ing contract signed and stop being a s**thouse.' Fury said.  Though the rivals had reconciled following their second meeting, tensions began rising once more earlier this year after it emerged that Fury was planning on coming out of retirement to make a return to the ring.  In an interview with iFL TV last month, Chisora said: 'Listen Frank Warren and the Gypsy King's posse, just tell me when and where or what time and I am there. I just want to fight, if you are a fighter you should fight everybody out there. It is just business it would be a great fight with Tyson.'  Chisora last fought back in July, where he earned a hard-fought split decision victory in a rematch with Kubrat Pulev, breaking a three-fight losing streak in the process.  Meanwhile Fury has recently been training alongside Joseph Parker as the former world champion prepares for a main-event clash with British Olympian Joe Joyce on September 24.  Fury has also been linked with a showdown with the winner of the rematch between Oleksandr Usyk and Anthony Joshua that is due to be staged later this month in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.","* Tyson Fury is planning to come out of retirement to fight Derek Chisora

101,1343457,"* The increase in active defined benefits schemes. Broadly, 16 times the pension increase.  * Pension contributions made to a defined contribution arrangements including personal, employer and third-party contributions.  If the annual allowance is exceeded, unused allowance from the three previous tax years can be “carried forward” to increase it. Where the allowance is exceeded, the excess is taxed at your marginal rate.  A scheme can be required to pay the charge out of your benefits if you have exceeded £40,000 in their scheme and your tax charge exceeds £2,000. Where the amounts are lower, the scheme can still pay voluntarily.  The origins of the MPAA  From April 2011, you could take your whole pension as a lump sum under the old flexible drawdown rules if you had secure income of £12,000 a year. If you did, future contributions were effectively banned as your AA became zero.  With pension freedoms, flexibility was available to all and as the intention was to allow people to work flexibly and keep saving into a pension there was a need for something new. With access to large lump sums the government had to prevent people ”recycling” their pensions purely to get further tax relief.  The new rule was the MPAA, which was initially set at £10,000, and £4,000 from 6 April 2017.  How does the MPAA work?  From the tax year that someone first flexibly accesses their pension they are subject to the MPAA. Future money purchase contributions are restricted to £4,000. If you exceed £4,000, the AA you have for defined benefits is reduced by £4,000.  Carry forward cannot be used. Importantly, the rules for when you can force your scheme to pay are unlikely to be usable. You need to exceed £40,000 and the excess alone generates a charge of £2,000 or more.  How do you flexibly access benefits?  There are 7 ways, known as MPAA triggers:  1. Uncrystallised funds pension lump sum (UFPLS)  This is a new type of lump sum payment introduced from April 2015 and the payment of one triggers the MPAA.  2. Flexi-access drawdown  A designation of funds for flexi-access drawdown does not in itself trigger the MPAA, nor does the payment of a PCLS. However, once income is taken, the MPAA applies from the date of the payment.  3. Capped drawdown income above cap  Those in “capped drawdown” on 5 April 2015 continued with the same rules in place. However, if they choose to take an income above their cap the MPAA will apply from when the income payment that breaches it is paid.  4. Existing flexible drawdown  People who had flexible drawdown funds immediately before 6 April 2015, were treated as having triggered on 6 April 2015 as their drawdown became flexi-access on this date.  5. Standalone lump sum  A standalone lump sum that is paid out after 5 April 2015 will trigger the MPAA where the reason the whole pension was paid as a lump sum was the member had primary protection and lump sum rights at A-day in excess of £375,000.  6. Flexible annuity  Many annuities are “flexible” but for MPAA purposes it is a very specific type of annuity. It is an annuity where entitlement occurred after 5 April 2015 and it varies in a way not permitted before that date. Allowable variations are in the Registered Pension Schemes (Prescribed Manner of Determining Annuities) Regulations.  7. Scheme pension (less than 12 members)  Where a client is entitled to scheme pension from a money purchase arrangement after 6 April 2015 this will trigger the MPAA unless there are 12 or more members entitled to scheme pensions .  Can you access pensions and not trigger the MPAA?  Yes.  Pension commencement lump sum (PCLS) only  Where you vest enough pension to take a lump sum to meet your needs and do not take any income.  Capped drawdown income within the cap  You can change the income amount within the cap at any time for example starting, reducing or increasing.  Defined benefits  Benefits such as PCLS and pension or trivial commutation lump sums do not trigger.  PCLS and scheme pension from a DC occupational scheme  Providing there are at least 12 members receiving a scheme pension there will be no trigger. Therefore scheme pensions from small self-administered schemes will be a trigger.  Small pots  A small pot payment made under The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations is not a trigger.  Dependants' benefits  Taking dependants' benefits is not a trigger. This includes death benefits for non-dependants too for example, lump sums or nominees drawdown.  Standalone lump sums  These are allowed for any amount as long as they do not fit the trigger criteria above.  Lifetime annuity  An annuity that is only allowed to vary in such a way that was permitted prior to 6 April 2015 is not a trigger.  Disqualifying pension credits  Income taken from assets wholly attributable to a disqualifying pension credit, that is, pension credits from divorce pension sharing orders where the benefits were already in payment at the time of the order, is not a trigger.  So who will be impacted and what can you do?  There are two cohorts:  1. Those yet to take benefits  It will become an issue when they want to take flexible benefits but foresee continued DC savings over £4,000. They will need to accept the tax charge, reduce future savings plans or make alternative savings arrangements.  Planning may require the transfer of pension benefits to a scheme that will allow benefits to be taken in a way that does not trigger the MPAA. Individual circumstances will dictate if benefits can be taken in a way that does not trigger. Alternatively, perhaps non-pension savings could be used to meet their needs.  2. Those who have already triggered the MPAA  Anyone who has flexibly accessed benefits is potentially impacted if they are still contributing, or having contributions made on their behalf or by their employer and these exceed £4,000. A check of pension contributions against available allowances should be a part of any review process, so the reduction should be caught for those getting advice. Others will need to rely on employers/schemes informing them of the rule changes.  This will not necessarily be an issue only for high earners; relatively small salaries with good quality workplace provision could be impacted.  Some schemes will receive 18 per cent of salary between employer and employee. This would impact people on salaries from £22,223, a figure below the national average wage. Conversely, anyone only having auto-enrolment minima contributions paid will not trigger regardless of salary.  Like those who have yet to trigger their benefits the issues are the same, if they are already contributing, or looking to start, they will have to restrict them to £4,000 or pay the tax charge. Alternate savings vehicles may be needed.  Where a tax charge is payable then this will have to be declared to HMRC through self-assessment and the charge paid, it may be possible to have this collected through future PAYE coding.  Case study  Finally, it should be remembered that avoiding a MPAA charge might not be a good thing.  Let's take Bob. He earns £40,000 a year and his employer pays 6 per cent of this into a pension. Where Bob pays up to 6 per cent too, his employer will match it.  You can see from the table below that the amount of any MPAA charge will be under Bob's control - it will be based on how much he decides to pay.  Once the MPAA is reached:  Bob effectively receives no tax relief on each additional £1 he contributes, so;  • Each £1 of pension costs him £1;  • On withdrawals this £1, after 25 per cent tax free and 20 per cent tax, gives 85p  Ordinarily this would not be sensible.  However, while the employer is matching contributions:  • Bob's £1 gets him 85p.  • His employers £1 costs him 20p tax,  • His employers £1 also returns 85p, so;  • Bob's £1 generates £1.50.  So, suffering an MPAA charge makes Bob better off while his employer matches his contribution. Once the employer matching stops, the pension no longer seems worth it.

The MPAA should be factored into the advice process but do not always try to avoid breaching it. Tax is only bad where the net benefit is not worth it.

The government responded to their consultation on a reduction to the money purchase annual allowance (MPAA) on 20 March. Despite pressure from industry, the reduction is going ahead.

Before we get onto the MPAA, it is worth a resume of the “normal” annual allowance rules. Everyone ordinarily has an annual allowance of between £10,000 and £40,000 that covers:
* The increase in active defined benefits schemes. Broadly, 16 times the pension increase.  * Pension contributions made to a defined contribution arrangements including personal, employer and third-party contributions.  If the annual allowance is exceeded, unused allowance from the three previous tax years can be “carried forward” to increase it. Where the allowance is exceeded, the excess is taxed at your marginal rate.  A scheme can be required to pay the charge out of your benefits if you have exceeded £40,000 in their scheme and your tax charge exceeds £2,000. Where the amounts are lower, the scheme can still pay voluntarily.  The origins of the MPAA  From April 2011, you could take your whole pension as a lump sum under the old flexible drawdown rules if you had secure income of £12,000 a year. If you did, future contributions were effectively banned as your AA became zero.  With pension freedoms, flexibility was available to all and as the intention was to allow people to work flexibly and keep saving into a pension there was a need for something new. With access to large lump sums the government had to prevent people ”recycling” their pensions purely to get further tax relief.  The new rule was the MPAA, which was initially set at £10,000, and £4,000 from 6 April 2017.  How does the MPAA work?  From the tax year that someone first flexibly accesses their pension they are subject to the MPAA. Future money purchase contributions are restricted to £4,000. If you exceed £4,000, the AA you have for defined benefits is reduced by £4,000.  Carry forward cannot be used. Importantly, the rules for when you can force your scheme to pay are unlikely to be usable. You need to exceed £40,000 and the excess alone generates a charge of £2,000 or more.  How do you flexibly access benefits?  There are 7 ways, known as MPAA triggers:  1. Uncrystallised funds pension lump sum (UFPLS)  This is a new type of lump sum payment introduced from April 2015 and the payment of one triggers the MPAA.  2. Flexi-access drawdown  A designation of funds for flexi-access drawdown does not in itself trigger the MPAA, nor does the payment of a PCLS. However, once income is taken, the MPAA applies from the date of the payment.  3. Capped drawdown income above cap  Those in “capped drawdown” on 5 April 2015 continued with the same rules in place. However, if they choose to take an income above their cap the MPAA will apply from when the income payment that breaches it is paid.  4. Existing flexible drawdown  People who had flexible drawdown funds immediately before 6 April 2015, were treated as having triggered on 6 April 2015 as their drawdown became flexi-access on this date.  5. Standalone lump sum  A standalone lump sum that is paid out after 5 April 2015 will trigger the MPAA where the reason the whole pension was paid as a lump sum was the member had primary protection and lump sum rights at A-day in excess of £375,000.  6. Flexible annuity  Many annuities are “flexible” but for MPAA purposes it is a very specific type of annuity. It is an annuity where entitlement occurred after 5 April 2015 and it varies in a way not permitted before that date. Allowable variations are in the Registered Pension Schemes (Prescribed Manner of Determining Annuities) Regulations.  7. Scheme pension (less than 12 members)  Where a client is entitled to scheme pension from a money purchase arrangement after 6 April 2015 this will trigger the MPAA unless there are 12 or more members entitled to scheme pensions .  Can you access pensions and not trigger the MPAA?  Yes.  Pension commencement lump sum (PCLS) only  Where you vest enough pension to take a lump sum to meet your needs and do not take any income.

102,1063690,"Laughter rose above the buzz of clippers, the droning whoosh of the driers and the chatter of the more than 50 well-wishers who circulated through the shop on U.S. Highway One.  William and Sarah Wynn moved back to Wrens in the mid 1970s after her husband retired from the Marine Corps after suffering from a heart attack at Parris Island, SC.  ""I wanted to come back to Wrens because my family was here,"" Wynn said. ""It was a blessing I came back. There are some nice people in Wrens.""  She had been working at ThermoKing in Louisville for about three years when a second heart attack took her husband in 1977, leaving her alone with their 5-year-old daughter, Demetria.  Knowing she would now have to provide on her own for their family, Wynn decided she needed to quit work and go back to school. At first she thought about studying to be a nurse.  ""In nursing you have to go when they say go,"" she said.  Instead she chose cosmetology so she could be available for her daughter whenever she needed to be. She liked the idea of setting her own hours and being her own boss. When she started school, Wynn didn't know much of anything about cutting or styling anyone else's hair.  ""But anything I applied myself to I became good at,"" Wynn said.  She graduated the top of her class and went to work with Lucille Walker at the Beauty Box. A few months later Wynn noticed a little house for sale on U.S. Highway One, just a block and a half off Broad Street.  At that time there were not many black businesses downtown in Wrens, but she knew the area well and that there had once been many.  ""My daddy was raised up in this lot right over here and my great-grandmother had a restaurant over here,"" she said, pointing downtown. ""Right here on Short Street behind Peggy's, my grandparents and uncles had businesses. They owned a barbershop, a convenience store, a restaurant, and there was a funeral home back there too. All of that was black-owned (at one time).""  So Wynn hired a lawyer, got the money and bought the house. In 1984 she opened the salon she operates to this day.  It was a full-service salon offering hair analysis, relaxers, curls and cuts.  Demetria grew up at the base of a salon chair while her mother built a business.  ""It's something she loves doing,"" Demetria said. ""She has the passion for it and she's a real genuine people person. I think she's become so successful because no matter what, she came to the shop. She was sick sometimes but she came to the shop. She got up and served the people and it's still going.""  Demetria said she has ""beautiful memories"" of Delicate Touch and her mom's work.  Sometimes there were long days, Saturdays when the doors opened at 7 a.m. There was one Saturday before Easter when Delicate Touch had 33 children to treat and style in the single day.  ""Mama always helped people,"" Demetria said. ""If they didn't have a ride to come, she would make that happen. I think she's been so successful because she has a love for people and she really believed in serving her people.""  Wynn said that through the business she has been able to do more than serve the cosmetology needs of her clients, she has been able to serve other needs as well.  ""Really, God blessed me in this profession,"" Wynn said. ""He said come on Sara you need to be here. I paid for this shop in five years. And by having this business, if I heard about somebody that needed help, I helped them.""  In the late 1980s she helped raise money to bury a local man whose family did not have the money to cover those expenses. She has donated to multiple causes and provided jobs for teenagers and young adults who needed the opportunity.  Krystal Brown said she started cutting hair at Delicate Touch when she was in 10th grade and worked there on and off for around 15 years.  ""I have always worked high school kids,"" Wynn said. "" I gave them a job, but I always asked, are you in school. I always influenced them to stay in school. I told them school comes first. You got something to do, you go do it and then you can go back to work.""  After several years in business in Wrens Wynn partnered with her uncle Roy Boatwright and opened a second salon in Hephzibah. She ran both salons until she went to work as an examiner for the Georgia State Board of Cosmetology and Barbers and later trained students to become state board examiners.  Wynn slowed down and gave up most of her duties in the salon and at the state level three years ago when an injury made it hard to stand for long periods.  Today she still manages Delicate Touch, but barber Alton Crawford and stylists Evonne Brown and Alisha Hobbs see most of the customers there.  Crawford, who has had a barber chair in her salon for about 10 years, called Wynn a ""Godly woman.""  ""She'll do anything to try to help anybody,"" he said. ""She's a blessing to the community.""  Wynn herself said she was flattered by the attention she received last week. She says she owes her success to just being nice.  ""Some people come in and all they need is someone to talk to, someone to listen,"" she said.

103,484600,"Like Social Security, workers and their employers contribute to the plans.  But unlike future Social Security recipients, state pension plan enrollees are relatively confident they can bank on retirement funds.  Americans who once believed Social Security would be there for them in retirement now hope and pray only that they will get a little back from the federal government after contributing throughout their working lives. As a result, many Americans set aside a significant portion of their pay to invest in other retirement plans.  With this in mind, doesn't it seem crazy that Gov. Ted Strickland wants to tinker with the state's contribution to the Public Employees Retirement System as a short-term solution to his current budget crisis?  Didn't Strickland learn anything during his tenure as a U.S. congressman about the problems that arise when governments start raiding pension plans?  On Friday, Strickland unveiled his plan to fill a $3.2 billion revenue shortfall in the next two years by reducing state government's contribution to PERS from 14 percent to 8 percent.  Currently, employees contribute 10 percent to the retirement system.  This money grab of $250 million is bad public policy, short-sighted and probably unlawful.  On Wednesday, a dozen unions representing public employees sent the governor a stern warning that the plan would jeopardize the long-term retirement security of thousands of Ohioans, increase health-care costs and threaten the solvency of a $60 billion retirement fund that serves 936,000 members and retirees.  Strickland and his budget director, Pari Sabety, said this is a one-time effort to find money to pay for essential state services that could be cut and that the state will repay the pension fund over a period of years.  They might be sincere, but the governor's predecessors started raiding the tobacco settlement fund with similar promises, and that money will never be repaid.  Secondly, there is no guarantee Strickland will be governor in two years to carry out his promise ? and even if he is re-elected, the next budget might be worse than the current one due to billions of dollars in one-time money currently being spent that will not be there in 2011.  For the better part of 2009, the pension funds in Ohio have been taking a serious look at their return on investments in a troubled economy and attempting to address long-term financial questions.  Prior to April 1, the Public Employees Retirement System board split the 14 percent contribution from the state between the pension fund and health care, but the law mandates that the pension fund must be viable for 30 years, while the health-care portion is a discretionary fund.  In April, the board reduced the health-care portion to 5.5 percent and increased the pension investment to 8.5 percent.  In other words, two months before the unannounced raid on the fund, the board recognized they needed to put more money into the investment side of the plan to ensure it remains financially sound.  Strickland's and Sabety's plan reduces the state's contribution to 8 percent, which is 0.5 percent less than the board's decision to ensure the pension is viable for 30 years, and wipes out the amount going to health care.  Some Democratic state lawmakers believe the pension can afford to pay health-care benefits for the next 12 years with current monies, so there is no danger in grabbing the 5.5 percent for the next two years, but this is a real gamble with a lot of hard-workers' long-term security.  ESTABLISHED LAW  A dozen years ago, state lawmakers passed a bill to increase oversight and accountability in the state's five pension systems.  Understandably, no elected official wants to wake up and discover the pension plans are bankrupt.  At the same time, lawmakers demonstrated the foresight to recognize that tinkering with the pension plans should not be impulsive, so they put into law that the pension boards must prepare actuarial studies of any legislative changes that might have ''a measurable financial impact on the retirement system.''  They gave the boards 60 days to finish the studies.  Now laws must be followed by everyone, including the governor and his budget director.  In this case, no actuarial study has been completed of the impact of nabbing $250 million from the fund or reducing the state's contribution from 14 to 8 percent ? and that would seem to pass the ''measurable financial impact on the retirement system'' test.  REVISIONS CONSIDERED  Lawmakers and the governor should take a long look at the pension plans, because there are significant issues on the table.  The boards of the five plans already are discussing revisions to the age and service retirement requirements, benefit formulas, lump-sum death benefit payouts and cost-of-living allowances (COLAs) ? as they should.  Currently, someone can retire after 30 years at any age, the COLA is 3 percent annually, and a worker's retirement is based on their highest three years of salary.  The pension boards are looking at raising the retirement age to 60, suspending the COLA and extending the retirement salary average to five years.  There are other ideas on the table, but the point is the boards are considering these changes because they recognize the days of big and easy returns on investments are over ? and investments pay 70 cents out of every dollar in benefits for retirees.  Governor, the signs are there that the pension plans have enough problems without a state raid on their funding.

Ask anyone you know whether they would rather be vested in one of Ohio's five retirement systems or Social Security, and the overwhelming response will be a state pension plan.

The five state pension plans are stable, reliable, dependable.
Like Social Security, workers and their employers contribute to the plans.  But unlike future Social Security recipients, state pension plan enrollees are relatively confident they can bank on retirement funds.  Americans who once believed Social Security would be there for them in retirement now hope and pray only that they will get a little back from the federal government after contributing throughout their working lives. As a result, many Americans set aside a significant portion of their pay to invest in other retirement plans.  With this in mind, doesn't it seem crazy that Gov. Ted Strickland wants to tinker with the state's contribution to the Public Employees Retirement System as a short-term solution to his current budget crisis?  Didn't Strickland learn anything during his tenure as a U.S. congressman about the problems that arise when governments start raiding pension plans?  On Friday, Strickland unveiled his plan to fill a $3.2 billion revenue shortfall in the next two years by reducing state government's contribution to PERS from 14 percent to 8 percent.  Currently, employees contribute 10 percent to the retirement system.  This money grab of $250 million is bad public policy, short-sighted and probably unlawful.  On Wednesday, a dozen unions representing public employees sent the governor a stern warning that the plan would jeopardize the long-term retirement security of thousands of Ohioans, increase health-care costs and threaten the solvency of a $60 billion retirement fund that serves 936,000 members and retirees.  Strickland and his budget director, Pari Sabety, said this is a one-time effort to find money to pay for essential state services that could be cut and that the state will repay the pension fund over a period of years.  They might be sincere, but the governor's predecessors started raiding the tobacco settlement fund with similar promises, and that money will never be repaid.

105,679329,"How Long Does It Take To Rebuild Your Credit?  If you have bad or poor credit, rebuilding your credit takes time and patience because negative information remains on your credit report for seven to 10 years. It also depends on the credit relationship, the length of your credit history and the steps you take to rebuild your credit. You can't remove negative reports when it comes to your past credit card relationships. But you can show good faith to creditors if you do not go back to your old spending habits.  Which Credit Card Should I Shop For?  The best recommendation is to always get a secured credit card. Some do require security deposits upfront and are often far less expensive than unsecured credit cards for people with bad credit. And if you do some diligent research, and use your card wisely, it can generally be changed over to a regular credit card in a year or so.  Should I Keep My Old Credit Cards Open?  The longer an account is open, the better your credit score. Closing old credit cards has been known to hurt your credit score. This is because your FICO score is partially determined by the length of your credit history. If you're not using your credit cards anymore, and it doesn't carry an annual fee, put it some place safe and let it collect dust. If it does carry an annual fee, call the credit card company to see if you can downgrade to a card with no or low annual fees.  How Should You Maintain Your Credit Score?  Your credit score is calculated based upon your payment history, how much credit you have, and the length of your credit history. A good starting point is to pay your bills on time and to use your credit cards responsibly because your score will reflect these smart spending behaviors. Also, make multiple micropayments during the month to keep balances down. One important tip is to treat your credit card like a debit card where you make your monthly payments as soon as you see a purchase is posted.  How Should I Keep My Credit Utilization Low?  Utilization is the amount of your credit limit that you spend each month. For instance, if you have a $600 credit limit and spend $60 in a month, your utilization will be 10 percent. Your utilization is part of what determines your credit score. It is always advised that you should never exceed 30 percent of your credit limit. The best method is to be lower than 30 percent because the lower your utilization rate, the better your score will be. It's also recommended that you make one small purchase (like a carton of milk) each month to keep your utilization low. Doing so will help increase your credit score at a faster rate.  In summary, as long as you pay your monthly bills on time, all the time, and avoid maxing out your spending limit, your score will gradually improve. So pay your bills and use your credit cards responsibly. Your score will reflect these smart-spending habits.

106,607974,"It was on March 9, 2009 that stocks finally hit bottom in the financial crisis, after the Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 55 per cent in 17 months and gutted retirement and other investment accounts. The next day, the S&P 500 perked up by 6.4 per cent, and it's been racing higher ever since thanks to extraordinary stimulus from the Federal Reserve and a recovery in corporate profits, with only a few interruptions in between.  A $10,000 investment in the largest U.S. stock mutual fund has turned into nearly $42,000 since the bottom, and this bull market for stocks has already outlasted all but one other since World War II. Only the 1990-2000 run, which ran through the top of the dot-come bubble, lasted longer.  The long vault higher for stocks has helped buy-and-hold investors not only recover all their losses from the Great Recession but also to add to them. The S&P 500 set a record earlier this month, which means anyone with the fortitude to hold on through worries about a double-dip recession, the 2011 European debt crisis and a series of other shocks is now sitting on more than ever before. Unfortunately, not everyone held onto their stocks.  Through the years, many investors remained leery of the market, with the memory of the financial crisis still too painful. They stuck instead to bonds and other safer confines. In 2015, for example, investors pulled $107 billion more out of U.S. stock mutual funds and ETFs than they put in, according to the Investment Company Institute. In the first 10 months of last year, the trend continued, and investors yanked a net $109 billion out of U.S. stock funds.  Then, the election happened. Donald Trump's surprise White House victory in November raised hopes that corporate tax cuts, less regulation and other business-friendly policies would jolt the economy out of its slow-growth rut. Stocks surged, with S&P 500 index funds packing roughly a year's worth of gains into a few months, and investors quickly followed. Since November, investors have plugged more than $60 billion into U.S. stock funds.  Slightly less than half of all U.S. households owned stocks in 2013, with much of that concentrated among the highest-income households, according to the most recent data from the Federal Reserve's survey of consumer finances.  Of course, even though the bull market is getting a bit more love, it's still doubted.  Critics say this flow back into the market is happening at a time when stocks are already looking expensive. Prices have risen faster than corporate earnings, which means the market at the least no longer looks cheap. Analysts along Wall Street also say optimism may actually be too high, with expectations overdone for how much Washington can do to help businesses quickly.  More elections around the world are also on deck with the potential to upset the global status quo, such as in France. All the while, the Federal Reserve will likely continue to raise interest rates. That has many along Wall Street calling for stocks to pull back at some point this year.  Goldman Sachs strategists, for example, say the market may be close to its peak for the year, and they expect the S&P 500 to dip a few per cent by the end of the year.  At the same time, many analysts remain optimistic about the long term and say any pullbacks for the market will likely be only temporary. It would take a recession or a burst higher in inflation, which would force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates quickly, to kill the bull market, and many analysts see those scenarios as unlikely.  Stephen Auth, chief investment officer for equities at Federated Investors, says this may be a bull market that ends up running 20 years.  He sees this run as entering its third phase.

107,1053976,"Just days after a global pandemic was declared in March 2020, the Trump administration began offering homeowners the option of forbearance on their federally-backed mortgage payments, allowing them to reduce or defer those payments without penalty as a way to weather the financial hardships created by covid-related shutdowns and job losses. The program affected homes with mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and state corporations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and at its height protected more than 11 million families.   However, the Biden administration said in June that its month-long refresh of the program would be its last, and as August begins, at least 1.75 million homeowners remain in forbearance, or 3.5% of all homes in the US, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) has created three new safeguards that will help mitigate or delay foreclosures for a time, but they are confined to borrowers who fell behind during the pandemic and ultimately won’t halt foreclosure altogether.  Those measures, which protect borrowers more than 120 days behind on their payments, include a loss mitigation program that can delay foreclosure; requiring loan servicers to verify that a property is considered abandoned under local and state laws before proceeding with a foreclosure; and requiring loan servicers to make a “reasonable” effort to contact borrowers and to wait 90 days after doing so before beginning the foreclosure process.However, those protections don’t go into effect until August 31, meaning some could still be kicked out of their homes in the month-long gap.  About 1.5 million of the 1.75 million in forbearance are at least 90 days behind - a number roughly equivalent to that reported in March 2021 - and at least 20% of them won’t be able to forestall foreclosure past September, according to the Washington Post.“This is just more of the K-shaped recovery,” Diane Thompson, senior adviser to acting CFPB director Dave Uejio, told the Post. “The ones who are left [in forbearance] are by and large people who aren’t paying, can’t pay and haven’t made payments for a very long time.”  The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) signed into law in April 2021 provided $10 billion in a Homeowners Assistance Fund to help homeowners pay off that debt, but “the program is moving so slowly that protections are expiring before states have figured out how to distribute the money,” the Post reported. According to the paper, by Saturday, the US Treasury hadn’t even opened its portal for states to submit their distribution plans, meaning they can only access some 10% of what’s been set aside.  Budding Movement Demands Return of Eviction Ban  A similar situation has plagued the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, created by the CARES Act in December 2020 to distribute $25 billion in bailouts to renters behind on their payments. Between the December allotment and a subsequent $21.5 billion created for state and local programs in early 2021, some $46 billion was set aside to save more than 15 million American renters from eviction.  However, as Sputnik has reported, the federal eviction moratorium mandated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was also allowed to expire at the end of July without being replaced by a more concrete action, such as a federal law or executive order, and just a tiny fraction of the aid money - $3 billion in federal funds and $1.5 billion in state and local funds - has actually been paid out to struggling renters.Unlike homeowners, renters never got an equivalent pause on their rent payments, which have piled up into substantial debts over the past 18 months.People camp out on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to highlight the upcoming expiration of the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions, in Washington, U.S., July 31, 2021.  The result is that millions of Americans behind on rent payments face the immediate or impending threat of being rendered homeless, as some state eviction bans are also set to expire in the coming weeks.  With House lawmakers beginning a seven-week summer recess on Friday without replacing the eviction ban and the Senate set to join them later this week, activists have rallied to the call by Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), a progressive freshman representative, to occupy the steps of the US Capitol building until a new protection is enacted.On Tuesday afternoon, the CDC suddenly reversed course and issued a new ""targeted"" moratorium lasting until October 3, noting the order is confined to target areas with significant community spread of COVID-19, which heightens the risks associated with eviction and homelessness.  Unemployment, Student Loan Help Ending  Other pandemic protections are also being allowed to sunset, as well. Many US states have already voluntarily ended their federal unemployment benefit programs even as millions remain without jobs and new unemployment applications are once again rising. The federal program created by the ARPA was given sufficient funding to operate until September 6, but more than half of state governments had already cut theirs by early July, driven by conservative beliefs that the payments have been keeping Americans from more adamantly seeking out employment.Student loan deferment, also introduced at the start of the pandemic by the US Department of Education, allowed millions of Americans to preserve their meager incomes during lockdown periods by putting off payment of loans used to pay for their college education. The program is set to expire on September 30, 2021, but Biden hasn’t yet spoken on the issue. Americans hold roughly $1.7 trillion student loan debt.  Several lawmakers have pushed the Biden administration to extend it until March 2022, and to forgive up to $50,000 per person in student loan debt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen.

Foreclosure sign shown through a front gate of a foreclosed home in Oakland, California

The federal ban on evictions of renters wasn’t the only pandemic-related protection allowed to expire on July 31: a federal ban on foreclosures also ended, and while several ad hoc programs will mitigate the effect for a few months, nearly 2 million Americans remain behind on their house payments.
Just days after a global pandemic was declared in March 2020, the Trump administration began offering homeowners the option of forbearance on their federally-backed mortgage payments, allowing them to reduce or defer those payments without penalty as a way to weather the financial hardships created by covid-related shutdowns and job losses. The program affected homes with mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and state corporations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and at its height protected more than 11 million families.   However, the Biden administration said in June that its month-long refresh of the program would be its last, and as August begins, at least 1.75 million homeowners remain in forbearance, or 3.5% of all homes in the US, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) has created three new safeguards that will help mitigate or delay foreclosures for a time, but they are confined to borrowers who fell behind during the pandemic and ultimately won’t halt foreclosure altogether.  Those measures, which protect borrowers more than 120 days behind on their payments, include a loss mitigation program that can delay foreclosure; requiring loan servicers to verify that a property is considered abandoned under local and state laws before proceeding with a foreclosure; and requiring loan servicers to make a “reasonable” effort to contact borrowers and to wait 90 days after doing so before beginning the foreclosure process.However, those protections don’t go into effect until August 31, meaning some could still be kicked out of their homes in the month-long gap.  About 1.5 million of the 1.75 million in forbearance are at least 90 days behind - a number roughly equivalent to that reported in March 2021 - and at least 20% of them won’t be able to forestall foreclosure past September, according to the Washington Post.“This is just more of the K-shaped recovery,” Diane Thompson, senior adviser to acting CFPB director Dave Uejio, told the Post. “The ones who are left [in forbearance] are by and large people who aren’t paying, can’t pay and haven’t made payments for a very long time.”  The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) signed into law in April 2021 provided $10 billion in a Homeowners Assistance Fund to help homeowners pay off that debt, but “the program is moving so slowly that protections are expiring before states have figured out how to distribute the money,” the Post reported. According to the paper, by Saturday, the US Treasury hadn’t even opened its portal for states to submit their distribution plans, meaning they can only access some 10% of what’s been set aside.  Budding Movement Demands Return of Eviction Ban  A similar situation has plagued the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, created by the CARES Act in December 2020 to distribute $25 billion in bailouts to renters behind on their payments. Between the December allotment and a subsequent $21.5 billion created for state and local programs in early 2021, some $46 billion was set aside to save more than 15 million American renters from eviction.  However, as Sputnik has reported, the federal eviction moratorium mandated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was also allowed to expire at the end of July without being replaced by a more concrete action, such as a federal law or executive order, and just a tiny fraction of the aid money - $3 billion in federal funds and $1.5 billion in state and local funds - has actually been paid out to struggling renters.Unlike homeowners, renters never got an equivalent pause on their rent payments, which have piled up into substantial debts over the past 18 months.People camp out on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to highlight the upcoming expiration of the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions, in Washington, U.S., July 31, 2021.  The result is that millions of Americans behind on rent payments face the immediate or impending threat of being rendered homeless, as some state eviction bans are also set to expire in the coming weeks.  With House lawmakers beginning a seven-week summer recess on Friday without replacing the eviction ban and the Senate set to join them later this week, activists have rallied to the call by Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), a progressive freshman representative, to occupy the steps of the US Capitol building until a new protection is enacted.On Tuesday afternoon, the CDC suddenly reversed course and issued a new ""targeted"" moratorium lasting until October 3, noting the order is confined to target areas with significant community spread of COVID-19, which heightens the risks associated with eviction and homelessness.  Unemployment, Student Loan Help Ending  Other pandemic protections are also being allowed to sunset, as well. Many US states have already voluntarily ended their federal unemployment benefit programs even as millions remain without jobs and new unemployment applications are once again rising. The federal program created by the ARPA was given sufficient funding to operate until September 6, but more than half of state governments had already cut theirs by early July, driven by conservative beliefs that the payments have been keeping Americans from more adamantly seeking out employment.Student loan deferment, also introduced at the start of the pandemic by the US Department of Education, allowed millions of Americans to preserve their meager incomes during lockdown periods by putting off payment of loans used to pay for their college education. The program is set to expire on September 30, 2021, but Biden hasn’t yet spoken on the issue. Americans hold roughly $1.7 trillion student loan debt.  Several lawmakers have pushed the Biden administration to extend it until March 2022, and to forgive up to $50,000 per person in student loan debt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) appealed to Biden last week to make the move via executive action, urging that “failure to act would be unconscionable, would undermine our economic recovery.” "

113,54069,"""If you use it, you pay for it,"" Mohr told the House Commerce Committee before it voted 12-10 to send the bill to the full House.  The legislation would allow rate-regulated utilities to charge solar customers about $330 a year to pay for their use of the electric grid, Mohr said. REC and municipal utility solar customers share in the infrastructure cost, he said, but customers of the rate-regulated utilities do not.  Current customers would be grandfathered in, so they would see no rate change.  However, Rep. John Forbes, D-Des Moines, said solar customers benefit utilities during peak loads. Typically, he said, peak demand is on sunny summer days at the same time solar customers are producing at a maximum. They push electrons back onto the grid at a much lower cost than utilities can buy electricity on the market — 3 cents versus 20 cents to 21 cents — during peak demand, Forbes said.  The $330 per year fee probably would discourage investment in solar power because it would extend the payback for a typical residential solar power system from eight years to 14 years or longer, Forbes said.  ""The fact the rest of us are subsidizing it is the reason why you get eight-year payback as opposed to a 14-year payback,"" Mohr countered.  He also said the 800 jobs in the Iowa solar industry is about the same number as in wind energy in 2003. Now there are about 8,000.

LABOUR is reportedly planning to halve the inheritance tax threshold in a bid to honour its spending commitments.

It is understood shadow chancellor John McDonnell plans to slash the threshold to £425,000.
Tories last night slammed the plan as ""nonsensical"" and warned it was part of a massive tax bombshell Jeremy Corbyn is planning to impose if he makes it to Downing Street.  Known as ""death tax"", the controversial scheme is a tax on the estate of someone who has died, only payable if the value is above the set threshold.

115,1312974," In a survey conducted for Fidelity Investments by ICR Survey Research Group, nine out of 10 respondents said saving for retirement is an important financial goal for 1996.  In the same survey, however, only three in 10 participants were aware of pending legislation that would substantially enhance Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), a primary vehicle for retirement savings.    ""It's ironic that while everyone seems to place a high priority on saving for retirement, so few Americans are aware of the broad impact the proposed changes to IRAs could have on their retirement savings options,"" said Kathryn A. Hopkins, executive vice president of retail marketing, Fidelity Investments.  ""These are actually the most significant changes to the IRA since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. We anticipate that if the legislation is passed, IRAs could become much more attractive to a wide variety of Americans.""    According to Hopkins, major elements of the proposed changes to current IRA tax laws include:    o Allow everyone not covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan to make a tax deductible contribution to a regular IRA, regardless of income.  Unlike today, this would allow non-wage-earning spouses, as well as workers without pension coverage but whose spouses are covered by a pension plan, to make tax-deductible IRA contributions.    o For persons covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans, raise the income limits for making fully tax deductible contributions to their regular IRA.  These income limits would gradually rise over the next decade from $40,000 to $100,000 for couples and from $25,000 to $85,000 for individuals.    o Establish a new type of IRA -- The American Dream IRA -- available to all Americans.  This would eliminate income tax on all distributions made after 591/2, or on account of death or disability if this account has been in effect for at least five years, but would not provide a tax deduction at the time of contribution.  ""Special Purpose Distributions""  after five years would also be tax-free for: first time-home purchases, higher education expenses, catastrophic medical expenses or long-term unemployment.    o Also allow ""Special Purpose Distributions""  from both the regular IRA and the American Dream IRA without the normal 10 percent penalty.    o Allow any couple, even if one did not earn wages outside the home, to each make up to a $2,000 annual contribution to either a regular IRA or American Dream IRA for a total of $4,000 per tax year.

116,1045881,"That's partly how five executives with health insurance companies — four based in Wisconsin and one that does business in the state — see the market for insurance eventually evolving under the proposed Republican plan.  ""There's this promise that insurance is going to be less expensive,"" said Cathy Mahaffey, chief executive officer of Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Brookfield. ""How is that going to be accomplished?""  Insurance companies will lower premiums, she said, by providing less coverage.  ""That's the method we always have used,"" Mahaffey said.  The cost would be less because people will be buying less insurance, and that's not the same as lowering the actual cost of insurance, she said.  ""If we want to reduce the cost of insurance,"" she said, ""we've got to start talking about the cost of medical care.""  The proposed Republican plan also could lower premiums because fewer older people, who have higher medical bills, would buy health insurance, the insurers said.  The plan would allow health insurers to charge older people up to five times more than younger people as opposed to the current cap of three times under the Affordable Care Act.  The higher cap is in line with the actual cost of insuring people who are 55 and older, said Rob Plesha, an actuary and vice president who oversees the small group and individual markets for Quartz Health Solutions, which manages Gundersen Health Plan and Unity Health Insurance, in Sauk City.  However, the Republican plan also would provide tax credits tied to a person's age and not the cost of insurance. The tax credits — $3,500 for people 50 to 59; $4,000 for people 60 and older — would not offset the increase in premiums.  As it now stands, the cost of insurance would jump for older people — and, as a result, fewer of them would buy insurance.  ""The age composition (of the plans) changes dramatically,"" said Marty Anderson, chief marketing officer of Security Health Plan in Marshfield.  However, an amendment was added Monday night that featured an unusual approach: language paving the way for the Senate, if it chooses, to make the bill's tax credit more generous for people age 50-64. Details in the documents released were initially unclear, but one GOP lawmaker and an aide said the plan sets aside $85 billion over 10 years for that purpose.  About 57 percent of the people who have bought health plans from Security Health are over 50 — in part because the health plan's market is largely rural and has an older population.  The Congressional Budget Office last week estimated that the cost of health insurance for someone 64 would increase 20 percent to 25 percent by 2026 — and Anderson believes the increase could be even higher if older people didn't leave the market.  That could happen.  ""There are sick people who will go to great lengths to buy insurance,"" said J. Mario Molina, a physician and president and chief executive of Molina Healthcare.  The Congressional Budget Office's report released last week also found that premiums would be lower under the Republican plan because health plans would provide less coverage and because fewer older people would have insurance.  All this, though, is in flux.  The House is making changes to the initial plan, and the Senate is expected to do the same.  President Donald Trump conducted closed-door meetings with Republican legislators Tuesday, trying to win enough support for the House to approve the bill on Thursday.  ""This is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare,"" Trump said at a rally in Louisville, Ky., Monday night. ""We're going to do it.""  Parts of the Republican plan — particularly enabling health insurers to offer lower-cost health plans that hold more appeal to healthy people — are needed to stabilize the market, several insurance executives said.  ""We currently are in an unstable market,"" said Coreen Dicus-Johnson, president and chief executive of Network Health in Menesha.  As a generalization, younger people who are healthy care more about premiums and are more open to buying health plans that cover only major medical expenses than older people.  ""It's not a one-size fits all in health insurance,"" said Mahaffey, of Common Ground Healthcare. ""It's just not.""  The Affordable Care Act forces younger people to buy more insurance than they may want or need, effectively subsidizing the cost of insuring older people. As a result, too few young people bought insurance.  That doesn't make for a stable market, said Plesha, of Quartz Health Solutions.  The challenge is finding a way to get more healthy people to buy health insurance while ensuring that older people won't be forced out of the market.  How the Republican plan — at least in its current form — would do that isn't clear.  The Republican plan also would end the additional subsidies that are available to people with low incomes — such as someone making less than $11.50 an hour, or $24,000 a year — to offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.  People in that income group are the most likely to lose their health insurance because the tax credits under the Republican replacement plan are less than they receive under the Affordable Care Act.  That said, money included in the Republican plan to help stabilize rates could help lower costs for people who are older or who have very low incomes.  ""It all depends how that program is structured,"" said Anderson, of Security Health.  States would decide how to use the money, and how the plan would work isn't clear.  What is clear is the proposed plan would bring widespread changes to the market for health insurance sold directly to individuals and families. But how the changes will play out is anyone's guess.  ""It is not clear that these changes will stabilize the market,"" said Dicus-Johnson, of Network Health. ""There still are a lot of questions.""  However, she and the other executives believe that fewer people — particularly older people — will have health insurance under the Republican plan.  ""And that's a problem,"" Dicus-Johnson said.

""Voters deserve to have an accurate description of the initiative free from poll-tested words and phrases that confuse and distort the specific language of the initiative,"" he said in a statement.  The title and summary can sometimes be a key milestone for statewide initiatives.  In 2012, a different group pushing a pension effort said it had to abandon its plans to put its initiative on the ballot after receiving what it considered an unfavorable title and summary from Harris. In 2008, gay marriage opponents challenged then-Attorney General Jerry Brown's title for Proposition 8: ""Eliminates Right of Same-Sex Couples to Marry.""  Contact Mike Rosenberg at 408-920-5705.

Jill replies  You believe that your son has been sofa surfing — moving from one friend’s house to another on an unofficial and temporary basis. You told me you have told him on numerous occasions that he was welcome to move in with you “but he says that he is OK and is clean and tidy so obviously is. He is 43 and seems to be perfectly independent”.  Your son insisted that he has never told anyone that he lives at your address, but he did provide it to an employer as where his payslips should be sent and has also used it to obtain credit.  I told Glasgow council that you were unlikely to risk your job as a motor litigation consultant for a very well-known insurance company for the sake of saving a few hundred pounds a year through a fraudulent claim. I asked it to reconsider your claim for the single person discount and asked what evidence it needed to prove that your son does not live with you. You also invited the council to send inspectors.  Glasgow council told me that your single person discount was withdrawn in March 2019 and that its decision remained unchanged. You were apparently offered the option of going to the Valuation Appeal Committee but you have not pursued that.  The council tax office accepted your home as being your son’s main residence in the absence of any other address details and added that you do not need to be permanently resident at an address for it to be deemed a main residence for council tax purposes. However, it took on board my comments and a single person discount has been applied “from the 2021-22 financial year, on the understanding an inspection may be arranged over the coming weeks”. This will save you about £250 a year.  You are still insulted that staff did not believe you when you said your son has never lived with you, and we both think that if it is prepared to allow you the discount now, it should backdate it for two years. You said: “I understand that people do try to fiddle the council but this should not blind it to the fact that there are decent, honest people, and the default position should not be that all people are cheats unless they can prove they’re not. This is not about the money — I take this very personally.”  But the council is adamant. For your discount to be backdated to March 2019 you or you son must provide evidence of where he is living.  £54 for eco radiator valves? That smarts . . .  I am having problems with the British Gas subsidiary Hive, which is struggling to deliver on its promises of a “smart home” with regard to its thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs).  This smart valve allows you to control each individual radiator when fitted, which is brilliant because we’re all working from home and don’t want to heat rooms we’re not in. It should in theory mean good savings on gas bills and help to reduce waste.  I have eight of the valves and have had issues with them repeatedly calibrating, which means they turn the heating on and off over four hours to work out the radiator temperature. This happens pretty much all the time with one of my valves, which means the heating comes on at random times 24 hours a day.  This means my boiler is on a lot, my bills are higher than they should be, and the TRVs are £54 each, so trying to have a smart home has cost me money rather than saving it.  Now one of the valves has “bricked” and is out of warranty due to a technical failure — it’s 18 months old, which I don’t think is ancient by any stretch. Hive isn’t budging and seems to accept that this is normal for its devices. There are countless complaints about this piece of equipment. In theory Hive’s technology should be amazing. In reality, it seems to have been rushed out before it was ready. I’m resigned to buying another valve and living with the issues now I am locked in to the technology.  Jill replies  I asked Hive to either fix or replace your faulty valves, or to refund you their full cost. You were contacted by a senior support engineer, who spent a long time on the phone with you, helping you to remove and test every single thermostat. Hive also replaced the defective thermostat as a goodwill gesture.  You said: “Finally things seem to be working as they should. Thank you so much for helping exert this pressure on them. Without you I would have had to remove the system in its entirety.”  Feeling the pinch  I bought a Tempur Hybrid Elite 25 mattress from John Lewis online on February 16 for £1,657, price-matched to £1,449, to replace my old mattress that had developed a manufacturer’s fault which was aggravating my hip condition.  I was unable to go to the Newcastle store because we were in lockdown so I had to buy online without trying. I applied my own waterproof covering and the new mattress initially seemed OK, but after a week my hip condition has been greatly aggravated, my mobility reduced and pain increased. I was being woken at 3am and having to pace around the house until morning. The mattress is just too soft and doesn’t provide the support my condition needs.  I contacted the John Lewis aftercare team on February 23 and was told that as it was a comfort issue and the packaging has been removed, the Tempur could not be returned or exchanged. I could maybe appreciate that when it is possible to visit the store that this may seem reasonable, but in the present situation it seems anything but.  I put the mattress on eBay for £879. After finding a buyer I returned to the John Lewis website on April 17 to check the weight of the mattress for the courier. This is when I discovered that John Lewis is now offering a 40-day trial for exchange/refund of the exact mattress. I again contacted John Lewis aftercare but was told that because the trial policy had started on March 29 I could not return the mattress.  I am disabled and on a fixed income, and the Tempur mattress was intended as an investment in my health and an attempt to reduce my pain. It cost a lot of money and I am disappointed in the level of aftercare. This in no way detracts from the excellent customer care I have received from the sales and delivery staff.  Jill replies  You cancelled your eBay sale because you believed you would now be able to return the mattress to John Lewis. This is a shame: although the John Lewis staff member who said the mattress could not be returned because the packaging had been disposed of was incorrect, I’m afraid you still cannot return it.  Online purchases can normally be returned under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, provided that you notify the retailer of your intention within 14 days of receiving the goods. But certain items are exempt from this rule for hygiene reasons, and mattresses fall into this group. Retailers can waive the exemption, hence the proliferation of companies offering 100-day trials for mattresses in a box, but it is their choice. John Lewis says clearly that it will not exchange or refund mattresses unless they are subject to a supplier promotion.  John Lewis said the 40-day trial is being offered by Tempur. It asked Tempur if it would extend the offer to you but it refused.  However, John Lewis recognised that this has been a poor experience for you and has offered you a £200 voucher in apology. You have accepted and will be selling the mattress on eBay again.  Can we help you?

120,1261620," Lorna Vestey writes: Whether you decide to keep, to share or to sell the freehold, if you want to split the ownership of the building you will need to have leases drawn up by a property solicitor for both the flat and the commercial element (your dental surgery). The leases will contain provision for dealing with the costs of maintaining and insuring the structure and exterior fabric of the building, which will be split on a stipulated percentage basis (often calculated on comparative square footage/meterage). The freeholder will be responsible for arranging for appropriate maintenance and insurance. Internal repairs and decorations will be the responsibility of the leaseholder concerned.

This is because there may be extra matters to consider. For example, if there is roof space which might be suitable for conversion, you could include it in the domain of the existing flat but you might want to keep it, either to create another smaller flat yourselves (subject to the necessary permissions) or to sell it separately. You would need to make provision for access and make sure that this would all be possible under the lease granted on the existing flat. Personally, I would sell the flat on a long lease (say, 105 years) and keep the freehold, just to retain that extra element of control and for any future development potential. Alternatively, you could put the freehold into the ownership of a company in which both leaseholders were equal shareholders. You would sell the flat on a lease but with a share of the freehold.

122,4759,"Credit repair agencies are paying consumers with high credit scores to authorize its poor-scoring clients to piggyback on the solid accounts. The clients pay $800 to $900 to boost their score, said Oklahoma City attorney Eric Johnson. The participants with good credit can earn several hundred dollars for each person they authorize on a credit card.     A recent Associated Press story related how a Florida real estate agent paid $1,800 to be added as an authorized user on several credit card accounts with pristine credit. Alipio Estruch's credit score jumped from a 550 to 715 in about a month, and he secured a 7.5 percent mortgage rate to buy a $449,000 home.     Johnson, of the Phillips McFall law firm, represents a local mortgage lender and an auto lender, each of which was misled by customers' inflated credit scores. The customers later defaulted on loans granted because the credit scores were hiked through the piggybacking loophole, Johnson said.     ""I see it as mortgage fraud or outright fraud,"" Johnson said.     Scores of credit enhancement Web sites offer the service for a fee, Johnson said. Federal regulators could enforce existing laws to prevent the practice, Johnson said, but appear unwilling to try.     ""The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) looked at this and said 'We can't say this is illegal or is legal,'"" Johnson said. ""There are your tax dollars at work.""     The impact of the relatively new procedure likely will spread to insurance companies, which use credit scores to set rates, and businesses, which often purchase credit scores of potential employees during the hiring process, Johnson said.     Fair Isaac, the company that created the proprietary formula that determines credit scores, will close the loophole later this year in its calculation of FICO scores for at least one of the three credit reporting agencies. The other two credit reporting agencies should adopt the new scoring within a year, Fair Isaac said.     ""We will continue working with lenders, regulators and others in the credit reporting industry to end deceptive practices that fraudulently misrepresent consumer credit histories for profit,"" said Mark Greene, chief executive officer of Fair Isaac.     The adjustment removes authorized user accounts from consideration by the scoring model in FICO 08, the newest version of the credit score that Fair Isaac expects to become available to lenders starting in September.     Meanwhile, lenders will have to spend more time, effort and money to evaluate potential customers, Johnson said.     ""The whole credit industry now revolves around ability to take a look at that FICO score and make a decision on an interest rate or monthly payments based on that one score,"" Johnson said. ""If you can't rely on the FICO score, then you must go back to a manual scoring system.""     ""It's really bad stuff,"" Johnson said. ""Hopefully, we'll see it corrected and turned around, but it's not taking place quickly enough.""

Credit repair companies are taking advantage of a loophole in the calculation of credit scores, and fixing the problem will hurt consumers — particularly those just establishing credit.   

The practice, called ""piggybacking,"" has been used for years by consumers with good credit to help relatives or friends establish or improve their credit rating. Parents with good credit, for instance, can authorize a child to use their credit card and that act will boost the youngster's fledgling credit score.   
Credit repair agencies are paying consumers with high credit scores to authorize its poor-scoring clients to piggyback on the solid accounts. The clients pay $800 to $900 to boost their score, said Oklahoma City attorney Eric Johnson. The participants with good credit can earn several hundred dollars for each person they authorize on a credit card.     A recent Associated Press story related how a Florida real estate agent paid $1,800 to be added as an authorized user on several credit card accounts with pristine credit. Alipio Estruch's credit score jumped from a 550 to 715 in about a month, and he secured a 7.5 percent mortgage rate to buy a $449,000 home.     Johnson, of the Phillips McFall law firm, represents a local mortgage lender and an auto lender, each of which was misled by customers' inflated credit scores. The customers later defaulted on loans granted because the credit scores were hiked through the piggybacking loophole, Johnson said.     ""I see it as mortgage fraud or outright fraud,"" Johnson said.     Scores of credit enhancement Web sites offer the service for a fee, Johnson said. Federal regulators could enforce existing laws to prevent the practice, Johnson said, but appear unwilling to try.     ""The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) looked at this and said 'We can't say this is illegal or is legal,'"" Johnson said. ""There are your tax dollars at work.""     The impact of the relatively new procedure likely will spread to insurance companies, which use credit scores to set rates, and businesses, which often purchase credit scores of potential employees during the hiring process, Johnson said.

124,34346,"Technical analysts will tell you the TSX tends to be the last major market to top out in an economic growth cycle, as was the case last time. The S&P 500 reached a record high in 2007, a full year before the TSX. Canadian stock investors had little time to celebrate the TSX's high-water mark in 2008, as financial markets started crashing just a few months later.  If investors are feeling a sense of déjà vu, it is because, once again, the TSX returns to its highs a full year behind its American counterparts.  But analysts say the Canadian stock market may not be doomed to repeat history as there are a lot of differences this time around.  ""We're a long way from what happened in 2008,"" said Robert Kavcic, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. ""Right now, we're in a [monetary] easing cycle, and back then we were in a tightening cycle. Sure, stocks are expensive, but I don't think it's a fair comparison.""  Canadian stock valuations are now at a three-year high, which will certainly make some investors anxious. But, at the same time, the TSX has spent the past three years lagging its global peers, including American, Japanese and European stocks. For example, the S&P 500 churned out a blockbuster return of nearly 30% last year, while Canadian stock investors were left with a much less impressive 9.6% return.  Analysts have expected the TSX to catch up for some time. The resource-heavy index tends to peak late in the economic cycle, because that's when energy and industrial stocks generally take the baton from the types of companies that excel earlier in the economic cycle, such as consumer and financial stocks.  True to forecasts, the past couple of weeks have been a boon for energy stocks, which comprise roughly one-third of the Canadian stock market. The sector was up 5% in the past two weeks alone and is up 23.7% in 2014.  Unrest in Iraq, spurred by the capture of key towns by Al-Qaeda offshoot The Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), drove oil prices to one-year highs this month. Iraq is considered one of the world's most important markets for future oil supply growth and having an extremist militant group threaten the country's capital has spooked traders.  The heightened geopolitical risk has helped the TSX, but analysts are quick to point out that it can be risky for investors to be too bullish on Canadian stocks when they trade at record levels.  ""You have to be careful, because when you've been at these levels before, it's not been pretty and major selloffs have come quickly,"" said Bill Strazzullo, partner and chief market strategist at Bell Curve Trading. ""The 14,000 to 15,000 range, as 2008 and 2011 showed us, has been a perilous place to have exposure to the TSX.""  Trading at highs has always been a risky proposition for Canadian stocks, since their peaks often come late in the economic cycle, but market watchers note there is still a lot of potential. Multiple expansion, which has helped drive gains south of the border, has yet to bloom here, and earnings are expected to continue improving as Canadian companies benefit from a weak loonie that is trading at roughly a 10% discount to the U.S. dollar.  ""Canadian stocks are not cheap, but they are not expensive from a historical context,"" said Greg Taylor, vice-president and portfolio manager at Aurion Capital Management Inc. ""What we need to see the market go higher is expansion. What makes this year different than other years is we finally have commodity prices kicking in; we've seen that with oil, and we now need to see earnings expansion.""  But with Canadian stocks finally outperforming their U.S. counterparts after three years of disappointing returns, the question is whether that outperformance can continue.  Mr. Kavcic at BMO Capital Markets said many economists are forecasting the U.S. economy to outpace the Canadian economy in the coming years, so the TSX might not get to enjoy its current outsized gains for very long.  ""I would probably lean toward both markets returning to lockstep returns in the coming years,"" he said. ""The TSX has made up quite a bit of ground in the past couple of months, and unless you get oil prices to continue to run up the way they have, I don't see Canada continuing to outperform.""  Mr. Taylor disagrees, predicting that if the market cycle is in fact currently in the middle phase and commodity prices continue to climb, the TSX should post better returns than its U.S. counterparts over the next 12 to 18 months. He does, however, identify one risk that could prevent that from happening: the U.S. Federal Reserve. ""The biggest risk is if Fed comes out and says they're behind the curve and start tightening sooner than expected,"" he said. ""That could throw off the market and halt the current rally.""  It's also worth noting that the TSX hasn't been above 15,000 for very long so the rally hasn't been stress tested. Mr. Strazzullo said he would wait until the TSX could stay above that level for more than a week before he became more bullish on the index.  ""I would feel a little better about it if we can hold another week here, hold at 15,000, because that would make me think the path of least resistance is higher,"" he said. ""If we can do that, then I would start talking about potential upside of 16,500. Not necessarily that it will reach that level, but we can start to see that kind of room on the upside.""  jshmuel@nationalpost.com  15,073.13 Previous TSX record close on June 18, 2008  15,109.25 New TSX record close on June 18, 2014 (A new record close was set June 19)","Investors who put up with lacklustre Canadian stock returns in recent years were finally paid off this week for keeping the faith.

126,408329,"Your home is your castle, and it is also a source of tax deductions. Yet, every year, Americans let these potential tax deductions pass by, not realizing how to take advantage of them.IRS Publication 530, titled ""Tax Information for Homeowners"", can fill you in on the deductions that are available to you for the 2016 tax year. Several of the most important tax benefits are listed below.Mortgage Interest - This should be the largest home-related tax deduction that is available to you unless you purchased your home in the 2016 tax year. You can deduct interest payments on either primary or secondary homes, up to the limit of $1 million in collective mortgage debt if married and filing jointly. The limits are $500,000 for single filers or married couples filing separately.The mortgage interest deduction applies to anything that meets the definition of a basic living space that you own. Condominiums, mobile homes, and even boats are included assuming that they meet the living space definition with at least one sleeping area, a kitchen, and a toilet. Details may be found in IRS Publication 936, ""Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.""Points - Any points that you paid at closing to lower the interest rate on your mortgage are deductible. Generally, the deductions must be amortized over the life of the mortgage, but there are circumstances where you may be able to deduct the entire amount of your points paid in the year of purchase. See Publication 530 for details.Property Taxes - You can deduct real estate taxes that are assessed uniformly (no taxes that reflect a special privilege or a service granted to you). Property taxes associated with the purchase of a home may also be deducted.Mortgage Interest Credit - Typically, mortgage interest is taken as a deduction. However, if you have a qualifying low income, you can claim mortgage interest as a credit instead. This subtracts the total directly from your tax bill instead of from your taxable income used to determine your tax bill. To claim this credit, you must have received a qualified Mortgage Credit Certificate from a suitable state or local agency. File Form 8396 along with your tax form to claim your credit.Home Equity Loans - When you borrow against your home equity, either with a loan or a line of credit (HELOC), the interest may be deductible depending on how the loan is used, the amount of the loan, and the value of your home.Forgiven Mortgage Debt - When a bank decides to accept a short sale for less than the value of a home and forgives the rest of the debt, that debt is usually considered as taxable income. In 2007, Congress created the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act to reclassify the forgiven debt as non-taxable income, saving already distressed homeowners from a huge tax burden. After being renewed several times, this tax relief measure expired at the end of 2016 and has not been renewed by Congress. However, the good news is that if you're in the process of discharging mortgage debt and signed a written agreement with the lender in 2016, you're still eligible for this tax exemption when you file your 2016 return. What's no longer covered is any mortgage debt cancelled in 2017 or beyond. Check the IRS publications and see if any of these valuable deductions apply to you.

The limits are $500,000 for single filers or married couples filing separately.The mortgage interest deduction applies to anything that meets the definition of a basic living space that you own. Condominiums, mobile homes, and even boats are included assuming that they meet the living space definition with at least one sleeping area, a kitchen, and a toilet. Details may be found in IRS Publication 936, ""Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.""Points - Any points that you paid at closing to lower the interest rate on your mortgage are deductible. Generally, the deductions must be amortized over the life of the mortgage, but there are circumstances where you may be able to deduct the entire amount of your points paid in the year of purchase. See Publication 530 for details.Property Taxes - You can deduct real estate taxes that are assessed uniformly (no taxes that reflect a special privilege or a service granted to you). Property taxes associated with the purchase of a home may also be deducted.Mortgage Interest Credit - Typically, mortgage interest is taken as a deduction. However, if you have a qualifying low income, you can claim mortgage interest as a credit instead. This subtracts the total directly from your tax bill instead of from your taxable income used to determine your tax bill. To claim this credit, you must have received a qualified Mortgage Credit Certificate from a suitable state or local agency. File Form 8396 along with your tax form to claim your credit.Home Equity Loans - When you borrow against your home equity, either with a loan or a line of credit (HELOC), the interest may be deductible depending on how the loan is used, the amount of the loan, and the value of your home.Forgiven Mortgage Debt - When a bank decides to accept a short sale for less than the value of a home and forgives the rest of the debt, that debt is usually considered as taxable income. In 2007, Congress created the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act to reclassify the forgiven debt as non-taxable income, saving already distressed homeowners from a huge tax burden. After being renewed several times, this tax relief measure expired at the end of 2016 and has not been renewed by Congress. However, the good news is that if you're in the process of discharging mortgage debt and signed a written agreement with the lender in 2016, you're still eligible for this tax exemption when you file your 2016 return. What's no longer covered is any mortgage debt cancelled in 2017 or beyond. Check the IRS publications and see if any of these valuable deductions apply to you. Take advantage of every tax deduction that you can. Otherwise, the government simply keeps more of your money.Get fast, easy, and FREE tax filing for simple returns with TaxAct!Photo ©iStockphoto.com/Pgiam  Originally Posted at: https://www.moneytips.com/top-tax-benefits-of-home-ownership  Understanding the Tax Benefits of a Mortgage  Men Benefit More from Mortgage Interest Tax Deductions  Deduct Your Mortgage Interest To Save On Taxes"

The trustees' report on Medicare's condition indicates that the hospital-insurance portion of that system will be completely bankrupt as soon as the year 2008. The hospital-insurance tax will have to rise from the present 2.9 percent to 7.8 percent by 2070 to keep the system in balance.  In short, unless there are fundamental changes to both the Social Security and Medicare systems, very large tax increases are in store for future workers. A new study by economists Jagadeesh Gokhale, Benjamin Page and John Sturrock, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, quantifies the impact. As the figure shows, currently living workers can expect to pay about 30 percent of their lifetime income in net taxes. But future generations can expect to pay two-thirds more, almost 50 percent.  The term net taxes takes account of both taxes paid and benefits received. For example, a worker born in 1950 can expect to pay 43 percent of his or her lifetime income in taxes and receive 9.5 percent of it back in the form of Social Security and other government benefits, for a net lifetime tax rate of 33.4 percent. The decline in the net tax rate for workers born in recent years is entirely due to the assumption of longer lifespans and hence greater future medical benefits for those workers. Future workers, however, will have to bear those costs.  As bad as it looks for future workers, there is at least some reason for optimism. The improved budgetary situation has led to a reduction in the lifetime net tax rate on future generations of more than 35 percent since the last time the figure was calculated in 1994. At that time, the net tax burden on future workers was estimated at an astonishing 84.4 percent.

130,1465948,"Small, young labour funds can, and do, hit the occasional home run. They identify small, private companies that eventually break on to the stock market or get gobbled up by some giant multinational at a rich premium to the original owners and the labour fund unit holders. In fact, the two fund managers with the best returns in the two-year period ended June 30 are both relatively new and quite small. Front Street Energy Growth Fund Inc. and Axis Investment Inc. posted average annual gains of 16.6 per cent and 9.4 per cent respectively.    Both started about two years ago and both have less than $15 million in assets under management, according the latest version of PALTrak invesment fund comparison software from Morningstar Canada.    On the flip side, what was formerly the first and largest national labour fund - Working Ventures Canadian Fund - was such a persistent dog that management of the fund was turned over to GrowthWorks Group of Cos. of British Columbia two years ago.    But, generally speaking, the smaller fund managers are limited in the choice of potential investments that they can attract, and the financial and human resources they can apply to help promising entrepreneurs break into the big time, argues David Ferguson, managing general partner of VenGrowth Capital Partners Inc.    VenGrowth is now the largest manager of labour sponsored investment funds in Canada. Founded in 1982, it began offering retail investors access to venture capital investment opportunities in 1994. Now it has more than $1 billion under management in three separate labour funds, with a fourth to open up later this summer. Its 26 investment managers specialize in different high-tech fields, several having brought years of experience with major international companies. Generally they are limited to overseeing no more than five investments.    Mutual fund dealers Robert Choquette and Dwight Alguire of Port Dalhousie Financial in St. Catharines say their clients are invested in a number of other labour funds. But the veteran advisers now recommend VenGrowth in preference to others.    Alguire said it was hard to know which labour funds would grow to be the largest when they first became popular, thanks to federal and provincial tax credits totalling up to 35 per cent of the value of $5,000 in annual investment. Now, though, VenGrowth is well out in front, while only three or four other groups manage more than about $300 million.    VenGrowth's recent investment returns have been far from stellar, at an average of 8.8 per cent, 7.9 and 2.2 per cent a year for the three funds respectively in the two years ended June 30.    But Ferguson says that's just a function of the horrible environment for selling or taking private companies public, a situation that has persisted for nearly four years. Investors must stay in labour funds a minium of eight years to keep their tax credits. So they are prepared to wait for a turnaround.    Signs suggest things are improving. For example, six young technology and media companies floated $280 million in stock-market issues in the first half of the year compared with only three deals in Canada during the same period last year.    Meanwhile, VenGrowth has been able to invest about $500 million at far more reasonable values in the past three years than was possible before the technology-stock bubble started to lose air in March, 2000.    ""This is a great time to be investing in private equity,"" argues Ferguson, a view strongly endorsed by managers of major pensions such as the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and the Canada Pension Plan.    Ferguson pointed to statistics from the United States, which has a more well-developed venture-capital market than Canada, although nothing like government-subsidized labour sponsored funds that now manage about $3.7 billion in assets.    A firm called Venture Source has reported the median or middle value assigned to all firms prior to attracting new venture capital investments in 2000 was $24 million (U.S.), whereas in the past two years the median value was only about $10 million.    Ferguson said the trend in Canada has been similar, offering the prospect of better returns in future for venture capital and labour fund investors.    Prospects are not so fantastic, though, that he thinks retail investors would be prepared to invest in labour funds without the benefit of rich government tax credits. But, he says, ""there will be a time.""  ","The Ontario government has recognized it, and so should investors: The size of a labour-sponsored investment fund manager matters a lot.  

The province went so far as to impose a moritorium on new fund registrations at the time of its budget in May, noting many existing funds that have sprung up in recent years are too small to be viable long-term investors.

Generally they are limited to overseeing no more than five investments.    Mutual fund dealers Robert Choquette and Dwight Alguire of Port Dalhousie Financial in St. Catharines say their clients are invested in a number of other labour funds. But the veteran advisers now recommend VenGrowth in preference to others.    Alguire said it was hard to know which labour funds would grow to be the largest when they first became popular, thanks to federal and provincial tax credits totalling up to 35 per cent of the value of $5,000 in annual investment. Now, though, VenGrowth is well out in front, while only three or four other groups manage more than about $300 million.    VenGrowth's recent investment returns have been far from stellar, at an average of 8.8 per cent, 7.9 and 2.2 per cent a year for the three funds respectively in the two years ended June 30.    But Ferguson says that's just a function of the horrible environment for selling or taking private companies public, a situation that has persisted for nearly four years. Investors must stay in labour funds a minium of eight years to keep their tax credits. So they are prepared to wait for a turnaround.    Signs suggest things are improving. For example, six young technology and media companies floated $280 million in stock-market issues in the first half of the year compared with only three deals in Canada during the same period last year.    Meanwhile, VenGrowth has been able to invest about $500 million at far more reasonable values in the past three years than was possible before the technology-stock bubble started to lose air in March, 2000.    ""This is a great time to be investing in private equity,"" argues Ferguson, a view strongly endorsed by managers of major pensions such as the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and the Canada Pension Plan.    Ferguson pointed to statistics from the United States, which has a more well-developed venture-capital market than Canada, although nothing like government-subsidized labour sponsored funds that now manage about $3.7 billion in assets.    A firm called Venture Source has reported the median or middle value assigned to all firms prior to attracting new venture capital investments in 2000 was $24 million (U.S.), whereas in the past two years the median value was only about $10 million.    Ferguson said the trend in Canada has been similar, offering the prospect of better returns in future for venture capital and labour fund investors.    Prospects are not so fantastic, though, that he thinks retail investors would be prepared to invest in labour funds without the benefit of rich government tax credits. But, he says, ""there will be a time.""  "

132,322739,"The way retirement village residents are charged for water differs from organisation to organisation.  Some villages receive a single, overall supply charge and water use bill for the entire estate and divide it equally between its residents. Residents in other villages are each slugged separate supply charges and water use bills, resulting in higher individual costs.  Under proposed changes to the Local Government and Valuation of Land Acts, homes within retirement villages would no longer be assessed individually by the Valuer General and instead each village would have a single valuation number.  This would mean that SA Water could no longer charge tenants individual water bills.  The South Australian Retirement Villages Residents Association supports the abolishment of individual assessments because it argues that villages should be treated the same as apartment blocks and shopping centres, which are charged for one or two meters and receive an overall bill.  However, councils have raised concerns that the new assessment structure could also remove their ability to levy separate fixed rate charges against individual dwellings in villages.  A parliamentary inquiry has been established to investigate the proposed amendments.  In a submission to the inquiry, LGA President Sam Telfer said the planned changes would leave councils short-changed by more than $2 million.  “To ensure the continued delivery of services in line with current expectations, councils would need to recover these significant shortfalls from all other ratepayers,” he said.  “This has the impact of benefiting a few to the detriment of the many.  “It is considered that issues associated with SA Water invoicing practices would be best managed directly with SA Water, rather than through a legislative change with a broader range of consequences.”  Onkaparinga Mayor Erin Thompson also lodged a submission to the inquiry, saying the changes could cost her council $2.8 million a year.  She said the council would need to raise rates or cut services to cover the shortfall.

133,43497,"* Workers will ‘lose out’ under plans to cut amount of tax relief on pensions  Changes to pensions risk ‘inflaming inter-generation tensions’ as workers realise they are losing out to retired people, financial experts have warned.  The Chancellor George Osborne is considering radical changes to tax benefits on pensions which are expected to hit middle-class savers hardest.  But workers in their 40s or younger will also ‘lose out’ if he goes ahead with plans to cut the amount of tax relief the government gives on pension savings, financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown said.  It warned that today’s workers are already set to receive around a third less in retirement than current pensioners and any changes would worsen the generational wealth divide.  The average private pension wealth held by those aged around 60 is about £149,300, but those now in their 40s will only have around £112,000 when they reach the same age, it said.  Tom McPhail, head of Retirement Policy, said government financial support for retirement needed to remain equal for all generations or it would risk ‘exacerbating the inequalities which already exist’ between old and young.  He added: ‘Today’s pensioners have worked hard and are now enjoying the fruits of their labours; no one would seek to deny them that.  ‘However we are deeply concerned that the younger workers of today face an uphill battle to achieve the same levels of retirement prosperity.  ‘Younger workers look with understandable envy at the generous guaranteed pensions enjoyed by many of today’s retirees.  ‘By contrast, workers in their 20s, 30s and 40s today can look forward to later retirement, lower contributions and fewer guarantees.  ‘Any reduction to the support given by the government to pension savers risks inflaming intergeneration tension.’  Currently, basic rate taxpayers receive a £2 top-up of tax relief from the Government for every £8 they save into a pension, while higher rate taxpayers – those earning more than £42,385 - receive £4 for every £6 saved.  The Government is considering plans to replace this system with one where all savers receive the same top-up – possibly around £2.50 for every £7.50 saved – regardless of how much they earn. It may also scrap the system all together and allow pensions to be drawn tax-free in retirement instead, like an ISA.  Research carried out for the Mail by pensions provider Fidelity found a middle class worker now in their 40s stands to lose between £44,000 and £110,000 by the age of 65 if Mr Osborne limits the tax relief paid on pensions.  The same worker would miss out on as much as £175,000 from their total pot if he scraps it altogether and treats pensions like ISAs instead.  Research by Royal London, a pensions provider, published today revealed a flat rate of tax relief at 25 per cent would be worth just £2 per week extra to basic rate taxpayers but could deter middle income workers from saving altogether.  Former Pensions Minister Steve Webb, who now works for the firm, said tinkering with pension tax relief amounted to ‘daylight robbery’.  He added: ‘A pension ISA steals billions of pounds in tax revenues from the next generation who will need the money to fund the public services of an ageing society.  ‘And if the Chancellor opts for a low flat-rate of tax relief, he will be stealing billions of pounds today from the support we give to hard-pressed savers.’  He warned last week that the Chancellor was also considering scrapping the tax free lump sum, in a move which would raise £4billion for the Treasury but affect millions of savers.","* Workers realise they are losing out to retired people, financial experts warn

136,1023737,"Some dream of spending their golden years in exotic locations, indulging in exciting trips to ancient ruins and sampling spicy, local cuisine. But when it comes to retirement savings, even the most adventurous seniors may still consider something routinely described as ""plain vanilla"": a fixed immediate annuity.  Perhaps the simplest of all the annuity options, a fixed immediate annuity does what its name suggests. It begins delivering steady income shortly after an investor buys a contract, often within 30 days and always within 13 months. A variable immediate annuity also delivers income quickly but, unlike with fixed annuities, your payments will fluctuate.  An immediate annuity is a contract between an investor and an insurance company, with the investor paying the insurance company a lump sum in exchange for regular income payments. Those income payments may be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually and are generally guaranteed to last as long as the contract holder is alive-or, depending on the terms of the contract, for a set period of time such as 10 or 20 years.  Fixed Immediate Annuities  Fixed immediate annuities have guarantees that can offer comfort to retirees who worry about the risks of keeping their money in financial markets. When you buy a fixed immediate annuity contract, you are guaranteeing that your monthly (or other periodic) income payments will remain the same, regardless of market conditions, for the time period specified in the contract.  The drawback of such a guarantee for fixed immediate annuities is that it won't bring big bucks. Fixed immediate annuity payments typically trail the returns that investors would see on equity and bond portfolios during a bull market.  Thus, the tradeoff for predictability might be lower returns when compared to what your money might have generated had you invested in the markets.  Another drawback to fixed immediate annuities is that, as time passes, a retiree with an annuity that offers a fixed payment amount may find that their regular payments don't stretch as far as they once did due to inflation. Annuity buyers can sometimes purchase riders with the contract that feature cost-of-living increases or fixed increases to soften the blow of inflation but, as with other riders, this will increase the cost of the annuity and may lower your overall returns.  Investors should evaluate their risk appetite when considering fixed immediate annuities. Retirees with a high risk tolerance and the ability to absorb risk may be turned off by fixed immediate annuities' conservative returns, but those with low risk tolerance and a wariness of market volatility may feel differently.  Variable Alternatives  Investors who want to receive annuity payments immediately along with the possibility of higher returns might want to consider variable immediate annuities. Variable immediate annuities, like other variable annuities, allow you to allocate your principal into a wide array of underlying investments, including stocks, mutual funds and bonds. Your allocations typically aren't set in stone, allowing you to move money out of one underlying investment and into another.  Unlike fixed immediate annuities, the value of your variable immediate annuity-and the payments you ultimately receive-will fluctuate based on how your underlying investments perform, meaning that investors have the potential to reap rewards if their investments grow but could also lose money if their investments flounder. As such, variable immediate annuities are considerably riskier than their fixed counterparts.  The Benefits of Living Longer  In general, those who may benefit most from immediate annuities are healthy people who expect to live longer-than-average lives. If your life were to be unexpectedly cut short, you would have received relatively little in annuity payments. And, unless your contract includes a death benefit or you have purchased certain riders, your surviving spouse or your heirs would not be entitled to any payments under a standard contract guaranteeing lifetime payments.  To mitigate the financial implications of dying earlier than expected, when purchasing an immediate annuity contract, you can generally purchase a rider to allow a beneficiary to receive some money from the annuity after your death. For example, some immediate annuities offer a period certain benefit, which guarantees that some amount of payments will be made to a beneficiary for a certain period of time after the contract holder dies. But a contract with this rider-or with any other sort of death benefit-will cost more. That means it will require a higher lump sum payment at the outset for the same amount of annuity income.  Investors considering immediate annuities should do their research and shop around because insurance companies may offer different features in exchange for the same lump sum payment.  And with all annuities, investors should remember that the annuity is only guaranteed as long as the insurance company issuing it remains in business, so you'll want to be sure you are comfortable with the issuer, not just the product itself.  * Original Link  Disclaimer  FINRA - Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. published this content on 14 July 2022 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Immediate Annuities
Some dream of spending their golden years in exotic locations, indulging in exciting trips to ancient ruins and sampling spicy, local cuisine. But when it comes to retirement savings, even the most adventurous seniors may still consider something routinely described as ""plain vanilla"": a fixed immediate annuity.  Perhaps the simplest of all the annuity options, a fixed immediate annuity does what its name suggests. It begins delivering steady income shortly after an investor buys a contract, often within 30 days and always within 13 months. A variable immediate annuity also delivers income quickly but, unlike with fixed annuities, your payments will fluctuate.  An immediate annuity is a contract between an investor and an insurance company, with the investor paying the insurance company a lump sum in exchange for regular income payments. Those income payments may be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually and are generally guaranteed to last as long as the contract holder is alive-or, depending on the terms of the contract, for a set period of time such as 10 or 20 years.  Fixed Immediate Annuities  Fixed immediate annuities have guarantees that can offer comfort to retirees who worry about the risks of keeping their money in financial markets. When you buy a fixed immediate annuity contract, you are guaranteeing that your monthly (or other periodic) income payments will remain the same, regardless of market conditions, for the time period specified in the contract.  The drawback of such a guarantee for fixed immediate annuities is that it won't bring big bucks. Fixed immediate annuity payments typically trail the returns that investors would see on equity and bond portfolios during a bull market.  Thus, the tradeoff for predictability might be lower returns when compared to what your money might have generated had you invested in the markets.  Another drawback to fixed immediate annuities is that, as time passes, a retiree with an annuity that offers a fixed payment amount may find that their regular payments don't stretch as far as they once did due to inflation. Annuity buyers can sometimes purchase riders with the contract that feature cost-of-living increases or fixed increases to soften the blow of inflation but, as with other riders, this will increase the cost of the annuity and may lower your overall returns.  Investors should evaluate their risk appetite when considering fixed immediate annuities. Retirees with a high risk tolerance and the ability to absorb risk may be turned off by fixed immediate annuities' conservative returns, but those with low risk tolerance and a wariness of market volatility may feel differently.  Variable Alternatives  Investors who want to receive annuity payments immediately along with the possibility of higher returns might want to consider variable immediate annuities. Variable immediate annuities, like other variable annuities, allow you to allocate your principal into a wide array of underlying investments, including stocks, mutual funds and bonds. Your allocations typically aren't set in stone, allowing you to move money out of one underlying investment and into another.  Unlike fixed immediate annuities, the value of your variable immediate annuity-and the payments you ultimately receive-will fluctuate based on how your underlying investments perform, meaning that investors have the potential to reap rewards if their investments grow but could also lose money if their investments flounder. As such, variable immediate annuities are considerably riskier than their fixed counterparts.  The Benefits of Living Longer  In general, those who may benefit most from immediate annuities are healthy people who expect to live longer-than-average lives. If your life were to be unexpectedly cut short, you would have received relatively little in annuity payments. And, unless your contract includes a death benefit or you have purchased certain riders, your surviving spouse or your heirs would not be entitled to any payments under a standard contract guaranteeing lifetime payments.  To mitigate the financial implications of dying earlier than expected, when purchasing an immediate annuity contract, you can generally purchase a rider to allow a beneficiary to receive some money from the annuity after your death. For example, some immediate annuities offer a period certain benefit, which guarantees that some amount of payments will be made to a beneficiary for a certain period of time after the contract holder dies. But a contract with this rider-or with any other sort of death benefit-will cost more. That means it will require a higher lump sum payment at the outset for the same amount of annuity income.  Investors considering immediate annuities should do their research and shop around because insurance companies may offer different features in exchange for the same lump sum payment.  And with all annuities, investors should remember that the annuity is only guaranteed as long as the insurance company issuing it remains in business, so you'll want to be sure you are comfortable with the issuer, not just the product itself.  * Original Link  Disclaimer  FINRA - Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. published this content on 14 July 2022 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

139,321002,"""Mary, I tried,"" she told her friend. ""I tried and I failed.""  Perhaps she was being too hard on herself. The forces arrayed against conservation in southern Utah were deeply rooted. County commissioners, state elected officials, the entire Utah congressional delegation - all were against the monument from the moment of its creation in 1996. They considered it a usurpation of local power, and they had acted at every chance to attack its legitimacy. Even the agency tasked with managing it - Shelton's employer, the local field office of the Bureau of Land Management - sometimes seemed against it. The Department of the Interior, which oversees the BLM, and Congress, which funds Interior, had not helped. By 2016, the budget for Grand Staircase had dropped to $4 million from $16 million in 2001. Three-quarters of the staff had been eliminated. ""Today, this monument office struggles to do the basic job,"" Shelton said recently.""We don't have adequate funding, we don't have adequate staff.""  Things were not supposed to go this way. At 1.9 million acres - 53 times the size of nearby Bryce Canyon National Park, bigger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined - the Grand Staircase was to have been the premier research monument in the national system, an outdoor lab for the practice of science. The 1996 proclamation by President Bill Clinton , who established it under the Antiquities Act, ""identified the Monument's birth in science,"" as the BLM's website describes. The vast Grand Staircase was still a frontier, Clinton said, much of it wild, unspoiled, with ""a spectacular array of historic, biological, geological, paleontological, and archaeological objects"" that required protection, care, study.  The end of scienceIn the early years, when funding and staff were in place, the Staircase was known as ""the Science Monument."" That science staff is mostly gone. ""The science we were supposed to be doing — it's not happening,"" Shelton said. ""The resources we were supposed to be protecting — we're not doing it.""  One day this spring, Shelton invited me for a hike on the Grand Staircase, not far from her home in Kanab, Utah. The afternoon before our rendezvous, I drove from the town of Escalante south across the Staircase on a rough dirt road called Cottonwood Wash.  The monument's name is no mere marketing ploy: It is a geological designation. The staircase it refers to runs from the youngest cliffs in the north, the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, to the oldest, the Vermilion Cliffs way in the south. Beyond the Vermilion Cliffs is the oldest step of all, the Grand Canyon, exposing the most ancient rock.  Among these steps there are plateaus and valleys, countless peaks, folds, streams, forests, mesas, gorges, buttes and canyons. I'd been up on the Kaiparowits Plateau and in the slot labyrinths of the Escalante River's tributaries and through the deep watery places of the Box-Death Hollow Wilderness and in the tall pines on Canaan Mountain, but I had never been down Cottonwood Wash was a winding, dusty, washboard road, hot and shadeless and lonely, crossing for 40 miles across scrub-steppe hills, fields turned golden with sunflowers, and canyons colored purple, mocha, mauve and orange. Halfway to Kanab, at sunset, I stopped.  The night was balmy, sweetened with the spring bloom, and moonless, the stars lavish. I saw no one else. My campsite was nothing more than a level spot under a piñon pine in a sandy turnout beside the road. Before bed I set out in the dark into a nameless little slot canyon, wandering for an hour or so, listening for wrens and loafing in the sandy bottom with boots off.  Shelton had advised this for any visitor to the Grand Staircase. ""I tell people you don't need a trail. You don't need signs. You don't need maps. Just go out and find your own way,"" she told me. ""Sit down, listen, observe, contemplate, be in the place where you are."" The Grand Staircase is not about the fast-food vistas of the national parks, she said. ""People want to drive to a viewpoint, then drive to another. This place requires effort. Time. Patience.""  Shelton is 60, petite, with a lush head of hair and a long Roman nose that gives her a serious, philosophical air. That she was willing to talk with me was a pleasure and a shock. For months, living in southern Utah near the Grand Staircase, I tried to interview current and former employees about the state of affairs. But no one would talk. Even in retirement, monument staffers were afraid.  We met by the side of another of the innumerable dirt roads in the Staircase, and ditched our cars, setting out cross-country. Shelton wanted to find a passage up a line of jagged cliffs called the Cockscomb. She and her husband, Jim, a retired homebuilder who joined us for the hike, spend a lot of time outdoors, bird-watching and fly-fishing and hunting for deer and elk, pheasants and ducks and chukars. Mostly they hike.  We never got to the Cockscomb. Instead, we strolled in an aimless pleasing way, stopping to sniff at wildflowers in a pygmy forest of piñons and junipers. The day grew very warm and the gnats swarmed. I was stunned by the variety of the flower, the colors, the perfumes: Hopsage with its intricate fuchsia petals, creamy milkweed beloved of monarch butterflies,the white Sego lily, purple phacelia, orange globemallow, the garish red petals of Indian paintbrush, the pale yellow petals of the prickly pear.  ""The subtleness of these colors,"" Shelton said, taking a knee next to a phacelia. ""The tenacity of this plant. It's tough to communicate these things. Or this."" She found a spot of hard black moss, Syntrichia ruralis. A few droplets from her water bottle: the moss was instantly green, soft as baby-flesh, photosynthesizing, growing before our eyes. ""Resurrection moss,"" she said. ""Now think of the adaptation. We've measured surface temperatures of 160 degrees here in summer. This moss goes to sleep. It survives. We're so anthropocentric we think technology is the highest form of literally everything on earth, when in reality the adaptations of a moss or a flower are far more evolutionarily successful than our building a skyscraper in Dubai. Maybe these are esoteric thoughts, I don't know. The landscape draws this thinking out of you.""  Not long before meeting Shelton, I took a walk along the Escalante River to spend time with the bees. The astonishing diversity of flowers in the spring brings a stampede of pollinators. Some are bright orange and furry, some metallic-looking, lime-green, others yellow or black or purple or neon-blue, all distinct.  Once upon a time, these wild native bees were among the subjects of the pioneering entomology funded by the BLM. In a five-year study during the early 2000s, researchers discovered that the 1.9 million acres of the monument had the second-highest bee diversity in North America. They found 648 species, 46 that were newly described, many of them endemic to southern Utah. They discovered a bee that only lives in the sandstone walls of the canyonlands. ""Some of these bees only pollinate certain flowers at certain times in specific conditions,"" Shelton told me. ""We still have so much to learn. And now that process has been cut off."" (Recalling her own doctoral research on pollinators decades ago in California, Mary O'Brien, Shelton's friend, told me, ""It took me two years to discover a relationship two wasp species had with two buckwheat flower species. The loss of this kind of research in the monument is devastating."")  When Shelton started in 2001, the Staircase had 140 employees, with more than half involved in science and research. There were two full science divisions: Cultural and Earth Sciences and the Biological Sciences. The science staff included botanists, soil experts, hydrologists, geologists, archaeologists, paleontologists and ecologists. The BLM maintained a dedicated $1 million annual fund for university research on the monument.  There were studies on the effects of climate change on native flora. There were studies on hydrology and erosion, on the microbes that live in sandstone, on aquatic insects in the driest parts of the desert. Researchers discovered a species of moth believed to be extinct. Scientists were consistently discovering new species of plants and insects that had never been described. One entomologist told Shelton that he had so many new insects piled up in his lab that he was hard-pressed to identify them all. Paleontologists recorded the fossil remains of dozens of different kinds of dinosaurs, including a new species of tyrannosaur, the world's largest oviraptor, and numerous new triceratops-like species. Archaeologists documented scores of prehistoric Native American dwellings, granaries, rock art panels. ""In the early years, in any given year, there were probably 60 universities, in virtually every scientific discipline you can think of — biological, cultural, geological, paleontological — conducting research on the monument,"" Shelton said. ""This was the last place to be mapped and settled in the United States. Part of our mission was to discover what's out there, to set some baseline data.""  The election of George W. Bush in 2000 signaled the beginning of the end of this. Funding cuts and subsequent staff losses accelerated throughout the 2000s. With the election of Barack Obama, the hope was that the death-by-thousand-cuts would be reversed. But it didn't happen. ""It wasn't like any other Democratic administration,"" said Shelton. ""We expected better from Obama,"" Sheldon said.  Today, the two science divisions are gone. There are fewer than 45 staffers. ""There's one guy left doing science, a paleontologist. Dr. Alan Titus,"" Shelton said. ""One guy. That's it.""  By locals, for localsBefore coming to southern Utah, Shelton worked at BLM offices across the American West. Her first job with the agency, in 1976, was as an interpretive specialist in the Mojave Desert near Barstow, California, developing educational programs and exhibits. Later, she worked in Colorado, Oregon and Washington, designing visitor centers and museums.  Utah, however, was different from anything she had experienced in the land-management bureaucracy. It was ""like entering another country."" What made the difference in the Utah BLM was the cultural and historical influence of Mormonism. ""That's truly a factor here,"" Shelton said. ""Anyone who doesn't see it is blind.""  The early history of the Latter-day Saints was one of separatism and sedition, driven by the belief that they were the chosen people on the continent. The Utah territory settlers in the 1840s, led by the prophets in Salt Lake City, dreamed of an independent Mormon nation that encompassed not just Utah but all of Nevada, parts of Idaho and Oregon, and a piece of Southern California. It was to be a religious imperium, with broad exploitation of natural resources and a port in San Diego for trade overseas.  In the years before Utah joined the union, the Mormon leadership under prophet Brigham Young undermined U.S. authority in the territory and advocated the violent overthrow of the government in D.C. They wanted its replacement with a theocracy led by the chosen ones. ""Much of the heated political rhetoric in the West about the evil federal government began in Utah,"" historian Will Bagley, author of many books of Western history and himself a former LDS member, told me recently.  Mormons today have integrated into the mainstream of business and government, and they dominate Utah's public-lands bureaucracy. A position with the BLM is a plum deal, providing benefits, security, a good salary. It's a process of capturing government jobs that Mormons call, with a sense of humor, ""homesteading.""  But the homesteaders, Shelton said, have a peculiar view of their relationship with the federal government. ""You have to realize that a large part of the federal land management workforce in Utah is anti-federal,"" she said. ""Probably half of the staff at the Grand Staircase is anti-federal. I think a lot of it does have to do with the Mormon way of thinking.""  Over the years, said Shelton, she has seen co-workers display a naked contempt for the federal environmental and resource laws that limit traditional local practices on the public domain, such as the grazing of livestock or the unrestricted use of off-road vehicles. Enmeshed in the web of local group and religious ties, these staffers often come from families of public-land ranchers who have run cows there for generations. They consider it their land, to be managed by locals, for locals. ""With some of these people there's a lack of acknowledgement that we're part of the United States of America,"" Shelton told me. ""They don't recognize that all Americans own this land, that it belongs to the people of Vermont and Florida and New York, too,"" she said.  I asked her why, if they hate the feds, are they working for them. ""Well, I've asked that myself. I don't know that I have a clear answer,"" said Shelton. ""But it does translate into some real conflict at the office.""There is a schism among employees at the Grand Staircase and in the Utah BLM. This is not just Shelton's opinion; I spoke with four current employees at the Grand Staircase who confirmed her observation On the one side are environmentally minded folks from outside the confines of Mormon culture, people like Shelton, who believe fervently in the federal public lands. Their ranks grew following the monument's establishment in 1996 with the funding then available for hiring new staff, many of whom were trained at world-class science institutions On the other side, said Shelton, ""I see a powerful anti-conservation interest, an anti-science interest, and certainly an anticlimate change position. I've sat in meetings with high-level people in Utah BLM who will roll their eyes when you mention climate change and say, 'Well, if you believe it.' You might as well be asking them to convert to Zoroastrianism. So our staffs are at odds with each other. There's a lot of antagonism. It's a really difficult place to work.""  I shared Shelton's comments about the Utah BLM with Larry Crutchfield, the public relations director at the Grand Staircase. In response, Crutchfield sent me an emailed statement from the monument's manager, Cindy Staszak, who was appointed there in 2014 and worked directly with Shelton. ""We pride ourselves on inclusivity and diversity,"" said Staszak. ""The Bureau of Land Management has a long and distinguished history of public service that does not create or accept boundaries based on religion, gender, ethnicity or other artificial divisions. It is wonderful to work with people who care about what they do and have dedicated themselves to the lands we manage.""  The cattle complaintStaczak's statement did not impress Shelton. ""I don't know why she'd say that,"" she said. ""Even though we try, it's just not that welcoming of communities of diverse people. But maybe she actually thinks the staff is diverse.""  From the very beginning, Utah officials — almost all of them conservative, Republican, Mormon — mounted a campaign of disinformation about the Grand Staircase. And this only served to exacerbate staff conflicts. Much of the campaign amounted to ""outright lies,"" Shelton told me. It was said that private land was condemned and stolen, that hundreds of public roads were closed. The lies trickled into the populace and calcified as rural myth. At the salon in Kanab where Shelton gets her hair done, a hairdresser told her that after Clinton seized the land, he ordered the government to alter the maps of the Staircase in a conspiracy to erase the record of private ownership. Southern Utahans who tell this story never know the names of the people whose land was stolen. That's because the land was already publicly owned, managed by the BLM.  But the most egregious alleged offense was that the monument ruined the public-lands livestock industry, that stockmen with permits on the 1.9 million acres were forced off their grazing allotments.  Statistics tell a different story. Roughly 97 percent of the monument remains open to cattle grazing. In the 3 percent where there are no cows, the stockmen willingly gave up their permits after conservationists paid handsome sums to ""buy them out."" According to BLM grazing data, permitted use within the monument is at roughly the same level now as it has been since the early 1990s. No reductions have occurred as a result of the Monument's designation.  Shelton notes that even with the straitened funding and staff cuts during the Bush and Obama years, one management program went untouched: livestock grazing subsidies. At the same moment they were losing science staff, the Staircase hired more range management staff, in positions with better salaries.  ""Trying to effect change is even more of an uphill effort now,"" a former staff botanist named Laura Welp told me. Welp now works for the nonprofit Western Watersheds Project to ameliorate environmental damage from public-lands grazing. ""My botany job was filled in-house by moving a young guy over from the range program who has lived in the area all his life, went to the nearby college where he was taught by livestock sympathizers, has extensive family and religious ties to the permittees and runs cattle himself on the adjacent field office. His understanding of advocating for the resource is running the bulldozer for the extensive vegetation treatments that are now going on to provide forage."" According to Welp, the recently hired assistant monument manager for natural resources is a former range staffer. He is also a bishop in the same Mormon church attended by the BLM official who hired him. The job of the range staff, said Shelton, is to maximize the number of cows. This means range improvements like more fences, roads, pumps, water pipelines, troughs, vegetation treatments, seedings - a program that benefits a small number of stockmen. Crutchfield said the BLM does not have available to the public the total amount spent on livestock subsidies at Grand Staircase.  So the staff, bereft of resources for other matters, is kept busy with cows. ""We've only surveyed less than 5 percent of the archaeological resources on the monument because most of the staff is doing paperwork for livestock grazing,"" Shelton said. ""Meanwhile, you throw all those cows out there and denude the landscape — and we don't even know what we're ruining, because we no longer seem to care.""  The past is prologueRecently, I called the former chief botanist at the monument, Walter Fertig, who quit in 2005 in protest of grazing policies. They were not in accordance with his findings as a scientist. ""I was exceptionally naive when I came to Grand Staircase,"" he told me. He had worked for 10 years in Wyoming, advising the BLM on endangered and threatened plant and animal species. ""In my previous experience, I had always been able to provide sound, unbiased information, and federal land managers and politicians could use that information to then make informed decisions. Or at least that is how I thought the world worked. It was a rude awakening to learn that scientific evidence did not matter in range management."" He suggested that the conflicts over Grand Staircase and other national monuments, especially when it comes to grazing, ""are really just proxy fights over local authority versus outside authority. ...

When Carolyn Shelton began working at southern Utah's Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in 2001, she expected to leave it in better shape for the next generation.

Fifteen years later, in spring 2016, her old friend Mary O'Brien, a local biologist, invited her over for dinner to celebrate her upcoming retirement. Shelton's eyes welled with tears at the thought of leaving. She had risen in the ranks - she was an assistant manager, the third most powerful person at the monument - but had not accomplished what she'd wanted, had not protected the land as she'd intended.
""Mary, I tried,"" she told her friend. ""I tried and I failed.""  Perhaps she was being too hard on herself. The forces arrayed against conservation in southern Utah were deeply rooted. County commissioners, state elected officials, the entire Utah congressional delegation - all were against the monument from the moment of its creation in 1996. They considered it a usurpation of local power, and they had acted at every chance to attack its legitimacy. Even the agency tasked with managing it - Shelton's employer, the local field office of the Bureau of Land Management - sometimes seemed against it. The Department of the Interior, which oversees the BLM, and Congress, which funds Interior, had not helped. By 2016, the budget for Grand Staircase had dropped to $4 million from $16 million in 2001. Three-quarters of the staff had been eliminated. ""Today, this monument office struggles to do the basic job,"" Shelton said recently.""We don't have adequate funding, we don't have adequate staff.""  Things were not supposed to go this way. At 1.9 million acres - 53 times the size of nearby Bryce Canyon National Park, bigger than Rhode Island and Delaware combined - the Grand Staircase was to have been the premier research monument in the national system, an outdoor lab for the practice of science. The 1996 proclamation by President Bill Clinton , who established it under the Antiquities Act, ""identified the Monument's birth in science,"" as the BLM's website describes. The vast Grand Staircase was still a frontier, Clinton said, much of it wild, unspoiled, with ""a spectacular array of historic, biological, geological, paleontological, and archaeological objects"" that required protection, care, study.  The end of scienceIn the early years, when funding and staff were in place, the Staircase was known as ""the Science Monument."" That science staff is mostly gone. ""The science we were supposed to be doing — it's not happening,"" Shelton said. ""The resources we were supposed to be protecting — we're not doing it.""  One day this spring, Shelton invited me for a hike on the Grand Staircase, not far from her home in Kanab, Utah. The afternoon before our rendezvous, I drove from the town of Escalante south across the Staircase on a rough dirt road called Cottonwood Wash.  The monument's name is no mere marketing ploy: It is a geological designation. The staircase it refers to runs from the youngest cliffs in the north, the Pink Cliffs of Bryce Canyon, to the oldest, the Vermilion Cliffs way in the south. Beyond the Vermilion Cliffs is the oldest step of all, the Grand Canyon, exposing the most ancient rock.  Among these steps there are plateaus and valleys, countless peaks, folds, streams, forests, mesas, gorges, buttes and canyons. I'd been up on the Kaiparowits Plateau and in the slot labyrinths of the Escalante River's tributaries and through the deep watery places of the Box-Death Hollow Wilderness and in the tall pines on Canaan Mountain, but I had never been down Cottonwood Wash was a winding, dusty, washboard road, hot and shadeless and lonely, crossing for 40 miles across scrub-steppe hills, fields turned golden with sunflowers, and canyons colored purple, mocha, mauve and orange. Halfway to Kanab, at sunset, I stopped.  The night was balmy, sweetened with the spring bloom, and moonless, the stars lavish. I saw no one else. My campsite was nothing more than a level spot under a piñon pine in a sandy turnout beside the road. Before bed I set out in the dark into a nameless little slot canyon, wandering for an hour or so, listening for wrens and loafing in the sandy bottom with boots off.  Shelton had advised this for any visitor to the Grand Staircase. ""I tell people you don't need a trail. You don't need signs. You don't need maps. Just go out and find your own way,"" she told me. ""Sit down, listen, observe, contemplate, be in the place where you are."" The Grand Staircase is not about the fast-food vistas of the national parks, she said. ""People want to drive to a viewpoint, then drive to another. This place requires effort. Time. Patience.""  Shelton is 60, petite, with a lush head of hair and a long Roman nose that gives her a serious, philosophical air. That she was willing to talk with me was a pleasure and a shock. For months, living in southern Utah near the Grand Staircase, I tried to interview current and former employees about the state of affairs. But no one would talk. Even in retirement, monument staffers were afraid.  We met by the side of another of the innumerable dirt roads in the Staircase, and ditched our cars, setting out cross-country. Shelton wanted to find a passage up a line of jagged cliffs called the Cockscomb. She and her husband, Jim, a retired homebuilder who joined us for the hike, spend a lot of time outdoors, bird-watching and fly-fishing and hunting for deer and elk, pheasants and ducks and chukars. Mostly they hike.  We never got to the Cockscomb. Instead, we strolled in an aimless pleasing way, stopping to sniff at wildflowers in a pygmy forest of piñons and junipers. The day grew very warm and the gnats swarmed. I was stunned by the variety of the flower, the colors, the perfumes: Hopsage with its intricate fuchsia petals, creamy milkweed beloved of monarch butterflies,the white Sego lily, purple phacelia, orange globemallow, the garish red petals of Indian paintbrush, the pale yellow petals of the prickly pear.  ""The subtleness of these colors,"" Shelton said, taking a knee next to a phacelia. ""The tenacity of this plant. It's tough to communicate these things. Or this."" She found a spot of hard black moss, Syntrichia ruralis. A few droplets from her water bottle: the moss was instantly green, soft as baby-flesh, photosynthesizing, growing before our eyes. ""Resurrection moss,"" she said. ""Now think of the adaptation. We've measured surface temperatures of 160 degrees here in summer. This moss goes to sleep. It survives. We're so anthropocentric we think technology is the highest form of literally everything on earth, when in reality the adaptations of a moss or a flower are far more evolutionarily successful than our building a skyscraper in Dubai. Maybe these are esoteric thoughts, I don't know. The landscape draws this thinking out of you.""  Not long before meeting Shelton, I took a walk along the Escalante River to spend time with the bees. The astonishing diversity of flowers in the spring brings a stampede of pollinators. Some are bright orange and furry, some metallic-looking, lime-green, others yellow or black or purple or neon-blue, all distinct.  Once upon a time, these wild native bees were among the subjects of the pioneering entomology funded by the BLM. In a five-year study during the early 2000s, researchers discovered that the 1.9 million acres of the monument had the second-highest bee diversity in North America. They found 648 species, 46 that were newly described, many of them endemic to southern Utah. They discovered a bee that only lives in the sandstone walls of the canyonlands. ""Some of these bees only pollinate certain flowers at certain times in specific conditions,"" Shelton told me. ""We still have so much to learn. And now that process has been cut off."" (Recalling her own doctoral research on pollinators decades ago in California, Mary O'Brien, Shelton's friend, told me, ""It took me two years to discover a relationship two wasp species had with two buckwheat flower species. The loss of this kind of research in the monument is devastating."")  When Shelton started in 2001, the Staircase had 140 employees, with more than half involved in science and research. There were two full science divisions: Cultural and Earth Sciences and the Biological Sciences. The science staff included botanists, soil experts, hydrologists, geologists, archaeologists, paleontologists and ecologists. The BLM maintained a dedicated $1 million annual fund for university research on the monument.  There were studies on the effects of climate change on native flora. There were studies on hydrology and erosion, on the microbes that live in sandstone, on aquatic insects in the driest parts of the desert. Researchers discovered a species of moth believed to be extinct. Scientists were consistently discovering new species of plants and insects that had never been described. One entomologist told Shelton that he had so many new insects piled up in his lab that he was hard-pressed to identify them all. Paleontologists recorded the fossil remains of dozens of different kinds of dinosaurs, including a new species of tyrannosaur, the world's largest oviraptor, and numerous new triceratops-like species. Archaeologists documented scores of prehistoric Native American dwellings, granaries, rock art panels. ""In the early years, in any given year, there were probably 60 universities, in virtually every scientific discipline you can think of — biological, cultural, geological, paleontological — conducting research on the monument,"" Shelton said. ""This was the last place to be mapped and settled in the United States. Part of our mission was to discover what's out there, to set some baseline data.""  The election of George W. Bush in 2000 signaled the beginning of the end of this. Funding cuts and subsequent staff losses accelerated throughout the 2000s. With the election of Barack Obama, the hope was that the death-by-thousand-cuts would be reversed. But it didn't happen. ""It wasn't like any other Democratic administration,"" said Shelton. ""We expected better from Obama,"" Sheldon said.  Today, the two science divisions are gone. There are fewer than 45 staffers. ""There's one guy left doing science, a paleontologist. Dr. Alan Titus,"" Shelton said. ""One guy. That's it.""  By locals, for localsBefore coming to southern Utah, Shelton worked at BLM offices across the American West. Her first job with the agency, in 1976, was as an interpretive specialist in the Mojave Desert near Barstow, California, developing educational programs and exhibits. Later, she worked in Colorado, Oregon and Washington, designing visitor centers and museums.  Utah, however, was different from anything she had experienced in the land-management bureaucracy. It was ""like entering another country."" What made the difference in the Utah BLM was the cultural and historical influence of Mormonism. ""That's truly a factor here,"" Shelton said. ""Anyone who doesn't see it is blind.""  The early history of the Latter-day Saints was one of separatism and sedition, driven by the belief that they were the chosen people on the continent. The Utah territory settlers in the 1840s, led by the prophets in Salt Lake City, dreamed of an independent Mormon nation that encompassed not just Utah but all of Nevada, parts of Idaho and Oregon, and a piece of Southern California. It was to be a religious imperium, with broad exploitation of natural resources and a port in San Diego for trade overseas.  In the years before Utah joined the union, the Mormon leadership under prophet Brigham Young undermined U.S. authority in the territory and advocated the violent overthrow of the government in D.C. They wanted its replacement with a theocracy led by the chosen ones. ""Much of the heated political rhetoric in the West about the evil federal government began in Utah,"" historian Will Bagley, author of many books of Western history and himself a former LDS member, told me recently.  Mormons today have integrated into the mainstream of business and government, and they dominate Utah's public-lands bureaucracy. A position with the BLM is a plum deal, providing benefits, security, a good salary. It's a process of capturing government jobs that Mormons call, with a sense of humor, ""homesteading.""  But the homesteaders, Shelton said, have a peculiar view of their relationship with the federal government. ""You have to realize that a large part of the federal land management workforce in Utah is anti-federal,"" she said. ""Probably half of the staff at the Grand Staircase is anti-federal. I think a lot of it does have to do with the Mormon way of thinking.""  Over the years, said Shelton, she has seen co-workers display a naked contempt for the federal environmental and resource laws that limit traditional local practices on the public domain, such as the grazing of livestock or the unrestricted use of off-road vehicles. Enmeshed in the web of local group and religious ties, these staffers often come from families of public-land ranchers who have run cows there for generations. They consider it their land, to be managed by locals, for locals. ""With some of these people there's a lack of acknowledgement that we're part of the United States of America,"" Shelton told me. ""They don't recognize that all Americans own this land, that it belongs to the people of Vermont and Florida and New York, too,"" she said.  I asked her why, if they hate the feds, are they working for them. ""Well, I've asked that myself. I don't know that I have a clear answer,"" said Shelton. ""But it does translate into some real conflict at the office.""There is a schism among employees at the Grand Staircase and in the Utah BLM. This is not just Shelton's opinion; I spoke with four current employees at the Grand Staircase who confirmed her observation On the one side are environmentally minded folks from outside the confines of Mormon culture, people like Shelton, who believe fervently in the federal public lands. Their ranks grew following the monument's establishment in 1996 with the funding then available for hiring new staff, many of whom were trained at world-class science institutions On the other side, said Shelton, ""I see a powerful anti-conservation interest, an anti-science interest, and certainly an anticlimate change position. I've sat in meetings with high-level people in Utah BLM who will roll their eyes when you mention climate change and say, 'Well, if you believe it.' You might as well be asking them to convert to Zoroastrianism. So our staffs are at odds with each other. There's a lot of antagonism. It's a really difficult place to work.""  I shared Shelton's comments about the Utah BLM with Larry Crutchfield, the public relations director at the Grand Staircase. In response, Crutchfield sent me an emailed statement from the monument's manager, Cindy Staszak, who was appointed there in 2014 and worked directly with Shelton. ""We pride ourselves on inclusivity and diversity,"" said Staszak. ""The Bureau of Land Management has a long and distinguished history of public service that does not create or accept boundaries based on religion, gender, ethnicity or other artificial divisions. It is wonderful to work with people who care about what they do and have dedicated themselves to the lands we manage.""  The cattle complaintStaczak's statement did not impress Shelton. ""I don't know why she'd say that,"" she said. ""Even though we try, it's just not that welcoming of communities of diverse people. But maybe she actually thinks the staff is diverse.""  From the very beginning, Utah officials — almost all of them conservative, Republican, Mormon — mounted a campaign of disinformation about the Grand Staircase. And this only served to exacerbate staff conflicts. Much of the campaign amounted to ""outright lies,"" Shelton told me. It was said that private land was condemned and stolen, that hundreds of public roads were closed. The lies trickled into the populace and calcified as rural myth. At the salon in Kanab where Shelton gets her hair done, a hairdresser told her that after Clinton seized the land, he ordered the government to alter the maps of the Staircase in a conspiracy to erase the record of private ownership. Southern Utahans who tell this story never know the names of the people whose land was stolen. That's because the land was already publicly owned, managed by the BLM.  But the most egregious alleged offense was that the monument ruined the public-lands livestock industry, that stockmen with permits on the 1.9 million acres were forced off their grazing allotments.  Statistics tell a different story. Roughly 97 percent of the monument remains open to cattle grazing. In the 3 percent where there are no cows, the stockmen willingly gave up their permits after conservationists paid handsome sums to ""buy them out."" According to BLM grazing data, permitted use within the monument is at roughly the same level now as it has been since the early 1990s. No reductions have occurred as a result of the Monument's designation.  Shelton notes that even with the straitened funding and staff cuts during the Bush and Obama years, one management program went untouched: livestock grazing subsidies. At the same moment they were losing science staff, the Staircase hired more range management staff, in positions with better salaries.  ""Trying to effect change is even more of an uphill effort now,"" a former staff botanist named Laura Welp told me. Welp now works for the nonprofit Western Watersheds Project to ameliorate environmental damage from public-lands grazing. ""My botany job was filled in-house by moving a young guy over from the range program who has lived in the area all his life, went to the nearby college where he was taught by livestock sympathizers, has extensive family and religious ties to the permittees and runs cattle himself on the adjacent field office. His understanding of advocating for the resource is running the bulldozer for the extensive vegetation treatments that are now going on to provide forage."" According to Welp, the recently hired assistant monument manager for natural resources is a former range staffer. He is also a bishop in the same Mormon church attended by the BLM official who hired him. The job of the range staff, said Shelton, is to maximize the number of cows. This means range improvements like more fences, roads, pumps, water pipelines, troughs, vegetation treatments, seedings - a program that benefits a small number of stockmen. Crutchfield said the BLM does not have available to the public the total amount spent on livestock subsidies at Grand Staircase.  So the staff, bereft of resources for other matters, is kept busy with cows. ""We've only surveyed less than 5 percent of the archaeological resources on the monument because most of the staff is doing paperwork for livestock grazing,"" Shelton said. ""Meanwhile, you throw all those cows out there and denude the landscape — and we don't even know what we're ruining, because we no longer seem to care.""  The past is prologueRecently, I called the former chief botanist at the monument, Walter Fertig, who quit in 2005 in protest of grazing policies. They were not in accordance with his findings as a scientist. ""I was exceptionally naive when I came to Grand Staircase,"" he told me. He had worked for 10 years in Wyoming, advising the BLM on endangered and threatened plant and animal species. ""In my previous experience, I had always been able to provide sound, unbiased information, and federal land managers and politicians could use that information to then make informed decisions. Or at least that is how I thought the world worked. It was a rude awakening to learn that scientific evidence did not matter in range management."" He suggested that the conflicts over Grand Staircase and other national monuments, especially when it comes to grazing, ""are really just proxy fights over local authority versus outside authority. ... It really has nothing to do with science or logic or reason.It is all about power.""  That power play is now unfolding with an unprecedented push against southern Utah's public lands.Last April, Republican Gov. Gary Herbert toured several towns near the Staircase to announce his objections. Herbert thought it ""too big, too unnecessary,"" as he told students during a visit to Bryce Valley High School in the village of Tropic. ""Probably there are 200,000 acres that deserve protection,"" he said. He would thus reduce by roughly 90 percent what Clinton described in his proclamation as ""the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.""

140,480445,"For a move from Austin, Texas, to Manhattan, one recent Roadway client requested special vaults constructed to transport his rare paintings, sculptures and musical instruments. The company complied with an additional request that the vaults be sealed so that only the client could open them, Mr. Sapir says.  After five vaults were loaded onto two trucks, the client insisted on following them in his car. ""At some point, however, he gave up following and switched to his private jet,"" Mr. Sapir says.  Forklifts were needed to unload larger items and the vaults out of the truck to the door of the client's Fifth Avenue condo building. In the end, this move cost the client about $35,000.  Using photographs from the homeowners' previous property, Roadway's concierge can also walk through the new home to mark where the audio system needs to be installed and ensure that closet layouts are reproduced exactly, Mr. Sapir says.  ""On the high end, planning is everything,"" says Nir Shuminer, owner of New York-based Scanio Movers, which specializes in luxury moves. Wealthy clients value careful packing over speed. While a traditional mover might provide six to eight people to pack up a home in a day or less, Scanio typically sends no more than two or three skilled packers who may take up to three days to ensure that fragile items, such as chandeliers, artwork and crystal, are packed so they won't get lost or damaged. Scanio recently completed a move that cost the client about $27,000 and included chandeliers, expensive artwork and some historical artifacts.  In addition to the moving company, the homeowner may retain a personal assistant or personal organizer to work on the move. This person may inventory and photograph every item that is packed and oversee the finer details of unpacking so that everything ends up in the right place in the new home, Mr. Shuminer says.  Project managers, such as New York-based NouvelleView, may also perform such tasks as calling utilities, arranging a cleaning crew, and hiring a contractor to wire a home-theater system, says Pamela Muller, the company's owner.  Helping clients sort through 35 years' worth of possessions can be emotional, Ms. Muller says. She compares her role to that of a ""move therapist,"" as clients decide what items to take and how they should be organized, she adds.  Management fees vary based on the scope of the move and services performed, Ms. Muller says. Last year, her smallest project cost the client $7,000, and four other moves cost more than $25,000, she says. These prices are on top of what the movers charge. In one case, the client paid NouvelleView $15,000, a traditional mover $30,000, and a fine-arts specialty mover an additional $25,000.  There's another essential expense when moving rare and valuable items: insurance. Traditional moving companies typically provide insurance by weight or volume of goods transported, not full replacement or market value of individual items, says Matt Davis, a collector specialist with Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Chubb Personal Risk Services.  Homeowners' insurance policies may extend coverage to include moves, but policies vary. Check to see if any special riders are in place and what types of damage or loss are covered, he adds.","Buying a luxury home is expensive enough. Moving into it can be costly, too.

The company complied with an additional request that the vaults be sealed so that only the client could open them, Mr. Sapir says.  After five vaults were loaded onto two trucks, the client insisted on following them in his car. ""At some point, however, he gave up following and switched to his private jet,"" Mr. Sapir says.  Forklifts were needed to unload larger items and the vaults out of the truck to the door of the client's Fifth Avenue condo building. In the end, this move cost the client about $35,000.  Using photographs from the homeowners' previous property, Roadway's concierge can also walk through the new home to mark where the audio system needs to be installed and ensure that closet layouts are reproduced exactly, Mr. Sapir says.  ""On the high end, planning is everything,"" says Nir Shuminer, owner of New York-based Scanio Movers, which specializes in luxury moves. Wealthy clients value careful packing over speed. While a traditional mover might provide six to eight people to pack up a home in a day or less, Scanio typically sends no more than two or three skilled packers who may take up to three days to ensure that fragile items, such as chandeliers, artwork and crystal, are packed so they won't get lost or damaged. Scanio recently completed a move that cost the client about $27,000 and included chandeliers, expensive artwork and some historical artifacts.  In addition to the moving company, the homeowner may retain a personal assistant or personal organizer to work on the move. This person may inventory and photograph every item that is packed and oversee the finer details of unpacking so that everything ends up in the right place in the new home, Mr. Shuminer says.  Project managers, such as New York-based NouvelleView, may also perform such tasks as calling utilities, arranging a cleaning crew, and hiring a contractor to wire a home-theater system, says Pamela Muller, the company's owner.  Helping clients sort through 35 years' worth of possessions can be emotional, Ms. Muller says. She compares her role to that of a ""move therapist,"" as clients decide what items to take and how they should be organized, she adds.  Management fees vary based on the scope of the move and services performed, Ms. Muller says. Last year, her smallest project cost the client $7,000, and four other moves cost more than $25,000, she says. These prices are on top of what the movers charge. In one case, the client paid NouvelleView $15,000, a traditional mover $30,000, and a fine-arts specialty mover an additional $25,000.  There's another essential expense when moving rare and valuable items: insurance. Traditional moving companies typically provide insurance by weight or volume of goods transported, not full replacement or market value of individual items, says Matt Davis, a collector specialist with Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Chubb Personal Risk Services.  Homeowners' insurance policies may extend coverage to include moves, but policies vary. Check to see if any special riders are in place and what types of damage or loss are covered, he adds."
141,733165,"QE has boosted net household wealth by £600bn, the Bank said. Extrapolating from ONS figures on how is distributed, the richest 10pc of the population have seen a paper gain of about £129,000 per household.  To be more specific still, in terms of household financial assets, the Bank pointed out that the rich are those from the older generation – pensioners and workers nearing retirement who own houses and share portfolios that account for more than half of those household assets.  In other words, as a demolition job of the angry claims by pensioner lobby groups that QE is impoverishing their members by lowering annuity rates, the report could not have been more comprehensive.  Sure, annuity rates are lower, the Bank conceded, but the other side of the same coin is that asset values are much higher. As a result, the overall effect on annuities has been ""broadly neutral"".  Those who have really suffered from the Bank's response to the financial crisis are aspirational young people looking to get on the property ladder and start saving. Record low interest rates of 0.5pc have made it harder to build up a deposit, while QE has made houses less affordable by pushing up prices.  In fact, the Bank said the only way in which QE has hurt pensions has been to increase the deficits of many final–salary schemes. But, once again, the young will be the casualties as ""the burden of these deficits is likely to fall on employers and future employees, rather than those coming up for retirement now"".  Although the Bank may have silenced its grey–haired critics, the evidence of generational discrimination could throw up new problems by making more QE difficult to justify.  ""By confirming the positive wealth effects of QE are likely to have been skewed towards the better–off, the paper risks providing additional ammunition to the policy's critics,"" said Chris Crowe, UK economist at Barclays Capital. ""Apart from any distributional considerations, the fact that these consumers are [less likely] to consume… will have tended to blunt QE's effectiveness in boosting aggregate demand.""  Numerous economic studies have shown that asset–rich individuals are less effective at boosting consumer demand than the less well–off, who are more likely to spend a windfall on the high street than on stocks and shares.  The fact the Bank has effectively chosen to favour the rich could also reignite the debate over how to operate QE.  Instead of buying gilts, some economists say, the Bank should be trying to boost growth by buying other assets.

147,1198163,"On Monday, Reed and former San Diego Councilman Carl DeMaio submitted two new initiative proposals. Harris must now write the ballot title and summary.  For each of the last two, she wrote first that it ""Eliminates constitutional protections for vested pension and retiree health care benefits for current public employees ... for future work performed.""  It sounds so ominous. If voters understood what it meant, a majority would probably support it. But they don't understand and the explanation doesn't fit neatly on a bumper sticker.  Consequently, polls testing that ballot language show that the measures would have lost. That's why Reed and DeMaio never pursued them. Instead, they're trying to ensure their latest measures do not affect current public employees' ""vested rights.""  Their latest two measures are directed at new workers. Each would slow mounting retirement costs for state and local governments but in slightly different ways:  --The Voter Empowerment Act would require voter approval to offer traditional pensions to employees hired after 2018. The balloting would be among residents of the affected jurisdiction, such as a city, county or, for state employees, the entire state.  The measure would also limit the government to paying no more than half the cost of pensions and other retirement benefits, with employees responsible for the rest. That 50 percent government share could only be increased with voter approval.  --The Government Pension Cap Act would continue allowing traditional pensions for public employees hired after 2018 without voter approval.  But governments could spend no more than 11 percent of a new employee's base compensation on retirement benefits, and no more than 13 percent for new police or firefighters. And that amount could be no more than half the total cost of the benefits. Only voters could increase those percentages.  Both measures are designed to limit retirement benefit expenses and to give voters more control so that union leaders and elected officials don't continue cutting costly backroom deals.  Reed and DeMaio plan to qualify one of the two measures for the November 2016 ballot. They want to see how the attorney general writes the ballot title and summary for each and then see which polls better before picking one to put out for qualification signatures.  They don't trust Harris, who is counting on labor support for her 2016 U.S. Senate campaign, to write evenhanded summaries of the two measures. They're bracing for a court fight.  But if they have to litigate, it's an uphill battle. The law gives considerable latitude to the attorney general's interpretation. Reed lost his court challenge to Harris' summary of his 2014 measure. And he and DeMaio didn't bother to challenge her summary of their measure filed earlier this year. In that instance, she was right that it would have affected current workers.  Instead, Reed and DeMaio took that measure and stripped out language affecting current employees to come up with the current Voter Empowerment Act. They also tried to ensure that the Government Pension Cap Act would not affect vested rights.  California's vested rights doctrine is one of the most protective in the nation. Created by a series of state Supreme Court rulings, it essentially says that once public employees start working, the rate at which they earn retirement benefits in the future can never be reduced.  California government workers have also been promised that they can go on leave or transfer between public agencies and retain their vested rights. The latest Reed-DeMaio initiatives need one change to ensure they don't affect those workers. I'm told that change is planned.  At some point, voters need to change the state's vested rights doctrine, if they want to significantly trim public employee retirement costs. Otherwise the expense will continue siphoning off larger portions of local government budgets, leaving less for basic services.  In the meantime, Reed and DeMaio are working within the existing legal framework.  Daniel Borenstein is a staff columnist and editorial writer.

Oct. 09--Former San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed has twice rolled out statewide pension reform initiatives. Each time, Attorney General Kamala Harris effectively killed the measures before Reed could start collecting signatures to place them on the ballot.

This time might be different.
On Monday, Reed and former San Diego Councilman Carl DeMaio submitted two new initiative proposals. Harris must now write the ballot title and summary.  For each of the last two, she wrote first that it ""Eliminates constitutional protections for vested pension and retiree health care benefits for current public employees ... for future work performed.""  It sounds so ominous. If voters understood what it meant, a majority would probably support it. But they don't understand and the explanation doesn't fit neatly on a bumper sticker.  Consequently, polls testing that ballot language show that the measures would have lost. That's why Reed and DeMaio never pursued them. Instead, they're trying to ensure their latest measures do not affect current public employees' ""vested rights.""  Their latest two measures are directed at new workers. Each would slow mounting retirement costs for state and local governments but in slightly different ways:  --The Voter Empowerment Act would require voter approval to offer traditional pensions to employees hired after 2018. The balloting would be among residents of the affected jurisdiction, such as a city, county or, for state employees, the entire state.  The measure would also limit the government to paying no more than half the cost of pensions and other retirement benefits, with employees responsible for the rest. That 50 percent government share could only be increased with voter approval.  --The Government Pension Cap Act would continue allowing traditional pensions for public employees hired after 2018 without voter approval.  But governments could spend no more than 11 percent of a new employee's base compensation on retirement benefits, and no more than 13 percent for new police or firefighters. And that amount could be no more than half the total cost of the benefits. Only voters could increase those percentages.  Both measures are designed to limit retirement benefit expenses and to give voters more control so that union leaders and elected officials don't continue cutting costly backroom deals.  Reed and DeMaio plan to qualify one of the two measures for the November 2016 ballot. They want to see how the attorney general writes the ballot title and summary for each and then see which polls better before picking one to put out for qualification signatures.  They don't trust Harris, who is counting on labor support for her 2016 U.S. Senate campaign, to write evenhanded summaries of the two measures. They're bracing for a court fight.  But if they have to litigate, it's an uphill battle. The law gives considerable latitude to the attorney general's interpretation. Reed lost his court challenge to Harris' summary of his 2014 measure. And he and DeMaio didn't bother to challenge her summary of their measure filed earlier this year. In that instance, she was right that it would have affected current workers.  Instead, Reed and DeMaio took that measure and stripped out language affecting current employees to come up with the current Voter Empowerment Act. They also tried to ensure that the Government Pension Cap Act would not affect vested rights.  California's vested rights doctrine is one of the most protective in the nation. Created by a series of state Supreme Court rulings, it essentially says that once public employees start working, the rate at which they earn retirement benefits in the future can never be reduced.  California government workers have also been promised that they can go on leave or transfer between public agencies and retain their vested rights. The latest Reed-DeMaio initiatives need one change to ensure they don't affect those workers. I'm told that change is planned.  At some point, voters need to change the state's vested rights doctrine, if they want to significantly trim public employee retirement costs. Otherwise the expense will continue siphoning off larger portions of local government budgets, leaving less for basic services.  In the meantime, Reed and DeMaio are working within the existing legal framework.  Daniel Borenstein is a staff columnist and editorial writer.

152,1401249,"Volunteers who host Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion receive £350 a month per family as a “thank you”, provided they don’t charge rent.  But hosts have argued that this money from the Government does not go far enough as energy and food bills continue to rise.  They are also spending thousands preparing their homes to accommodate large families.  'Energy bills have more than doubled'  Jonathan Clive Blake, 65, is the archbishop of the Open Episcopal Church. In March, he and his wife, Annette, 63, volunteered to host Ukrainian refugees. This week, after a month-long “bureaucratic nightmare” of forms and visa processing, a family of five began living in their south London home.  Mr Blake estimated he spent at least £2,450 settling the family, buying new beds and turning the top floor of the house into a bedroom for the mother, father and four-year-old daughter.  Hosts must manually apply for the £350 payment at the end of every month. Mr Blake said: “It’s disingenuous to suggest this is a ‘thank you’ payment when it’s obviously long-term support to cover costs,” he said.  He added that the Government should invest in a “set-up grant” for households who want to host Ukrainian refugees.  The family’s energy bills have more than doubled since the refugees moved in, having already skyrocketed following the increase in the energy price cap in April.  Mr Blake said: “Our energy bill went from £20 a week to £45 a week. With the family living here it’s gone up to £90 a week. It’s a bit frightening.”  While the refugee family grapples with the process of securing jobs, school places, and doctors’ appointments, Mr and Mrs Blake continue to provide financial support. Neither of the Ukrainian parents was able to continue working remotely for Kyiv-based companies – although Mr Blake said the father had secured freelance work as a video editor in London.  “At the moment they are disorientated,” he said. “So we’ve provided everything and guided them towards the things they need to do to get set up.  “We’ve got two fridges so we’ve given them one. They’ve started taking responsibility for the kids’ meals but we still share an evening meal.”  The refugee family is aware of the rising energy costs and Mr Blake said the family would likely contribute “in time, based on how much they all use”. Ukrainian refugees are permitted to work in the UK, and also receive £200 upon arrival.  Between their full-time work and their portfolio of buy-to-lets, Mr and Mrs Blake have a “secure” income stream, although the couple set rents below the market average and refuse to raise them, not wanting to “cripple” tenants.  But Mr Blake said families who are less stable would be shocked by the immediate cost of welcoming displaced refugees.  “We’re more secure than many families without question but it’s not as simple as it seems,” he said. “On paper, we’ve got quite a lot of assets in our name but there’s a mortgage to be paid. The cash you have is constrained. A less secure family is going to realise too late that there are all these things you have to buy that they weren’t ready for.”  'Nowhere near enough'  Stan Benes, of Opora, a platform offering emergency assistance to Ukrainians in the UK, said the “thank you” payment had been misnamed, and the Government had issued “no clear guidance” to hosts regarding the intended purpose of the money.  “Many people were not prepared for what would be involved both practically and personally,” he said. “The £350 is a nice amount out of context, but if you consider the fact it should be used to offset extra costs then it’s nowhere near enough.  “There are many ways this could have been approached – and none of it is bad in and of itself – but it’s just not been thought through.”  Helena Tubridy, 62, a fertility expert, is currently hosting a Ukrainian couple and their five-year-old at her home in County Meath, Ireland. She has also had to economise, despite the couple, 31 and 32 respectively, continuing to work remotely as hydroelectric engineers for Kyiv-based employers.  The Irish government offers €400 (£340) a month per property to hosts, while Ukrainian refugees receive a monthly payment. Ms Tubridy said: “We are treating it as a house share – we keep our food separate. We’ve always had to be careful. It’s all very manageable, but we’re definitely feeling the pinch.”  After two and a half months, the Ukrainian couple began contributing a third of the household’s energy bills.  A government spokesman said: “We’re grateful to the UK public who generously volunteered to opened their homes to those fleeing the war in Ukraine. We know there may be some small additional costs associated with helping out, which is we offer an optional ‘thank you’ payment of £350 per month for all those opening their homes.  “Under the Homes for Ukraine scheme beneficiaries receive wrap-around support and can access work and benefits straight away, and receive a further £200 welcome payment upon arrival to cover any immediate costs.“","Hosts receive a monthly 'thank you' payment of £350 – but for some families it's 'nowhere near enough'

153,129040,"Moral hazard is often invoked to describe the effects of a given action. For example: ""If we give amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people will immigrate here illegally."" That kind of moral hazard is worth heeding.  But another aspect is likely at play with student loans: Even talking about an action will prompt some people to behave as it will happen eventually. Returning to the immigration example: ""Because highranking politicians say they want to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people already have immigrated here illegally.""  The mere possibility of being let offthe hook is enough for some desperate or just imprudent people to get themselves hooked in the first place - risking death or financial ruin.  Some actors in the financial crisis were probably (ahem) banking on a bailout if they got into trouble. There were plenty of examples within the memory of longtime executives: Penn Central Railroad, Lockheed, Franklin National Bank, Chrysler, Continental Illinois, various savings and loan institutions, even New York City - all between 1970 and 1990.  ""Too big to fail"" was almost 25 years old when it again became a common phrase in 2008. Too many lenders and investors had been spared the consequences of backing overly aggressive banks in the past.Were those banks indeed ""too big to fail""? Maybe. More to the point, the notion they might ever be allowed to fail came too late to prevent their bad behavior.  Back to student loans. No one believes for one second that a blanket forgiveness of student loans by the federal government - the lender in the vast majority of student loans - would be a one-time thing, any more than bank bailouts have been. If it is done once, it will become a permanent expectation.  But is it an expectation already?  Student debt certainly has increased in recent decades, by any measure. But short of thousands of borrowers admitting they took on debt thinking they'd get a bailout one day, it's hard to prove they acted on the expectation of loan forgiveness.  That said, the numbers tilt in that direction. The average cost for tuition and fees at a public university was about 5.1 times higher in 2020 than four decades earlier; for private universities, it was about 3.3 times higher.  The amount of debt per student was about 7.7 times higher. What's more, the share of enrolled students who took out loans also rose substantially.

Yes, that description fits the financial crisis that sparked the Great Recession. But it also describes student loans, which at a total of $1.75 trillion surpass Americans' aggregate credit-card debt and have some politicians talking about broad forgiveness. Both cases highlight a special brand of moral hazard - the kind our government creates when it helps fuel a problem, and then proposes a solution that allows others to escape the consequences of their actions.
Moral hazard is often invoked to describe the effects of a given action. For example: ""If we give amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people will immigrate here illegally."" That kind of moral hazard is worth heeding.  But another aspect is likely at play with student loans: Even talking about an action will prompt some people to behave as it will happen eventually. Returning to the immigration example: ""Because highranking politicians say they want to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people already have immigrated here illegally.""  The mere possibility of being let offthe hook is enough for some desperate or just imprudent people to get themselves hooked in the first place - risking death or financial ruin.  Some actors in the financial crisis were probably (ahem) banking on a bailout if they got into trouble. There were plenty of examples within the memory of longtime executives: Penn Central Railroad, Lockheed, Franklin National Bank, Chrysler, Continental Illinois, various savings and loan institutions, even New York City - all between 1970 and 1990.  ""Too big to fail"" was almost 25 years old when it again became a common phrase in 2008. Too many lenders and investors had been spared the consequences of backing overly aggressive banks in the past.Were those banks indeed ""too big to fail""? Maybe. More to the point, the notion they might ever be allowed to fail came too late to prevent their bad behavior.  Back to student loans. No one believes for one second that a blanket forgiveness of student loans by the federal government - the lender in the vast majority of student loans - would be a one-time thing, any more than bank bailouts have been. If it is done once, it will become a permanent expectation.  But is it an expectation already?  Student debt certainly has increased in recent decades, by any measure. But short of thousands of borrowers admitting they took on debt thinking they'd get a bailout one day, it's hard to prove they acted on the expectation of loan forgiveness.  That said, the numbers tilt in that direction. The average cost for tuition and fees at a public university was about 5.1 times higher in 2020 than four decades earlier; for private universities, it was about 3.3 times higher.  The amount of debt per student was about 7.7 times higher. What's more, the share of enrolled students who took out loans also rose substantially.  Students' willingness to take on debt is growing out of proportion, even to the soaring cost of higher education. This, despite the increasing clarity that salaries for college graduates aren't keeping up with debt loads. (The debt-toincome ratio for college grads tripled between 1980 and 2020.)

157,413374,"Girard gets it right, and the arms connect with the bus and send 350kW of juice surging into the bus's batteries.  ""Isn't it the coolest thing?"" said a young woman passing by.  The scene encapsulates Montreal's and much of the world's efforts at incorporating electric buses into public transit fleets - exhilaratingly cool but also frustratingly slow and replete with opportunities for economic and political disaster.  Although electric cars have been around for years and proved their worth, the technology to run heavy electric buses is relatively new, extremely expensive, and untested on a mass scale. (The exception is China, which has been adopting them on a very large scale to battle air pollution through national programs).  ""People worry about being an early adopter,"" Chris Stoddart, an executive at Canadian bus maker New Flyer Industries, told Reuters News. ""Remember, 20 years ago someone paid $20,000 for a plasma TV and then 10 years later it was $900 at Best Buy. People just don't want a science project.""  Public transit authorities and cities are treading carefully, testing out models with the idea of slowly going fully electric by 2040 to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Yet Montreal's first foray, using a quick-charging system already tested in Europe and deemed suitable for harsh winter climes, is already being criticized as a failed multimillion-dollar science experiment.  A Reuters survey found that only 300 out of 65,000 city buses in the U.S. were fully electric in 2017. A Toronto Transit Commission report from the same year said only 10 were running in all of Canada. Three of those were in Montreal.  Eighteen months after the first fully electric buses took to Montreal's roads on May 24, 2017, the experiment has been deemed ""very successful, even beyond our expectations,"" said François Chamberland, the STM's director of engineering, infrastructure and major projects. ""It was a North American first, to use rapid-charging technology.""  Of seven buses on the No. 36 route, three are all-electric quickcharging models. The STM is buying another four and putting them in service in 2019 to make the route fully electric. The buses have been recharged a total of 13,000 times, with an average recharging time of three minutes, less than the anticipated five. (On Friday, recharging took seven minutes, which the agency blamed on winter conditions and busier rush-hour driving.) Drivers and passengers like them because they're quiet, smooth and environmentally friendly.  ""It drives just like a regular bus, except its more powerful,"" said driver Girard, who took a one-day training course to be certified. ""They're very good buses.""  The buses have covered 135,000 kilometres with few problems, Chamberland said. The batteries are kept at a constant temperature, so Montreal's climate hasn't been a factor, although the buses use more energy in winter to battle through snow and defrost the windows. Diesel is used to run the heating system.  The buses save 40 per cent on energy costs, Chamberland said. Hydro-Québec charges are high due to the large amount of power the buses ingest each time they get to the end of their route, but costs are expected to drop.  At $800,000 apiece, the initial recharging stations were exorbitantly expensive because they were prototypes, but Chamberland said the price will come down now that more companies are producing them.  It took the STM four years to get their electric buses. At their first call for tenders in 2013, nobody bid. Only one company bid on the second attempt, then went bankrupt. So the STM and the city of Montreal partnered with longtime diesel and diesel-hybrid bus provider Nova Bus in St-Eustache, a division of Volvo Group, to develop an electric bus under a $17-million project dubbed City Mobility, funded largely by Quebec. They created an electric version of their diesel bus, inserting batteries and replacing the diesel engine with an electric one.  Although the buses are more expensive than the standard $900,000 diesel hybrids used by the STM, savings on fuel and maintenance are expected to even out prices, and costs are expected to drop as battery technology evolves.  Some, however, say the STM chose the wrong technology.  ""The STM jumped the gun a bit by purchasing its first three electric buses, expecting that the Quebec government would keep protecting Nova Bus with clearly preferential treatment,"" said Pierre Ducharme, president of the MARCON management consulting firm and founder of the Transportation Evolution Institute.  Ducharme said several studies, including one conducted by MAR-CON for the Edmonton Transit System, have concluded overnight (or slow) charging systems that take three to four hours to charge buses ""will be the best solution for the very vast majority of the needs of Quebec transit systems.""  Despite that ""wrong choice,"" the STM's experiment has proved electric buses can do the job reliably, Ducharme said.  Chamberland disagrees that it was a failed experiment. In 2013 there were few alternatives, he said. Slow-charging buses had a range of only 200 kilometres, less than half what a typical Montreal bus runs in a day, and were already being tested in places like Laval.  ""We chose to do a test of the quick-charge system, and share the results with all our partners, to be able to make a balanced choice in the future,"" he said.  Montreal has contracted to buy 30 slow-charging buses, built by Canada's New Flyer Industries, at a cost of $1.2 million each, and hope to put some into service by the end of 2019.  Since they won't complete a full route before requiring a recharge, it makes sense to have a mix of quick-charging and slowcharging buses, Chamberland said. The considerable challenge of incorporating sufficient charging stations and installing the large electric substations that will have to be connected to bus garages to handle the increase in voltage is another reason to act slowly and with prudence, Chamberland said.  Toronto recently placed orders for 30 electric buses from three suppliers - China's BYD; Proterra of the U.S. and Winnipeg's New Flyer - the first of which are supposed to arrive in December.  Montreal has pledged to buy only electric buses starting in 2025. But it has given itself a long exit ramp by contracting to buy 929 hybrid-diesel buses between now and 2024. Since the buses last 16 years, some of them will still be in service in 2040. rbruemmer@postmedia.com","Daniel Girard pulled his $1.2-million fully electric city bus into the parking lane under the recharging dock at Square Victoria during Friday morning rush hour, and waited for the two metal arms to descend and give him a quick charge.

Wayne Walker, the company's senior vice-president, said the results were exceptionally optimistic given that many starting lawyers and business graduates make $30,000 a year.  
""There may not have been a thorough understanding of marketplace salary levels,"" Walker told a news conference.    At the same time, 37 per cent of those surveyed said they'd be able to accumulate up to $100,000 in savings by 2001.    But another one-third said they only contribute a maximum of $1,000 a year to their own registered retirement savings plan or other investment program. Another 19 per cent indicated they put away up to $2,000 a year.    The survey also indicates about one-third think they'll have paid off the mortgage on a house or condominium in 10 years, with another 49 cent saying they will be buying property. Currently, about 62 per cent of Canadians own or are buying a home, he said.  "

160,294210,"All the while, the wealthy former businessman continued to insist he disclosed all his assets to the federal ethics watchdog when he came into office two years ago, and that he followed her recommendations very carefully to avoid any conflicts of interest.  That, the embattled Morneau has now decided, wasn't good enough.  ""I perhaps naively thought that in Canada following the rules and respecting the recommendations of the ethics commissioner ... would be what Canadians would expect,"" Morneau said at a news conference. ""In fact, what I have seen over the last week is that I need to do more.""  Morneau said he currently owns about a million shares - $21 million worth at current stock prices - in the human resources and pension management firm he and his family helped to build. Public filings show that in March, Morneau's father, William Morneau Sr., held just over 200,000 shares, worth about $4.2 million.  Morneau didn't, however, mention the dividends those shares generate: 6.5 cents a share, equating to roughly $65,000 a month.  When asked why he changed his mind, Morneau admitted the issue has become a major distraction and was taking away from what he characterized as his important work as Liberal finance minister - work he wants to continue doing.  ""I'm going to go farther, above and beyond anything that might have been recommended because I want to make sure that this isn't the discussion that we're having tomorrow or the day after,"" he said.  ""I am trying to make sure that we are successfully improving the lives of Canadians across the country, so if we're getting distracted because some people are worried about my personal situation, it's time to move on. And that's what I've decided to do.""  Morneau said until his shares are divested they will remain behind a conflict-of-interest screen, which has been overseen by the minister's chief of staff, to ensure he abstains from any discussions or decisions that could benefit his personal interests.  He said he could recall at least two instances where he was removed from meetings because of the screen.  Thursday's decision - aimed at silencing Morneau's increasingly vocal critics - could also be considered a tacit acknowledgment that the rules themselves are in need of an update, something the ethics commissioner herself has suggested in the past.  Commissioner Mary Dawson revealed this week that she told Morneau a blind trust wouldn't be necessary, since his shares were indirectly held through private companies and were therefore not considered a ""controlled asset"" under the Conflict of Interest Act.  However, Dawson urged the previous Conservative government in 2013 to amend the law to require blind trusts for personal assets owned by public office holders, regardless of whether they were directly or indirectly owned - a change that was never made.  Morneau, who stepped down as Morneau Shepell's executive chairman shortly after the election, said Thursday that when he first entered cabinet, he fully expected he would have to put his assets in a blind trust, as did the company he was leaving behind. However, Dawson told him it wouldn't be necessary, he said.  At that time, public filings showed Morneau owned 2,254,109 shares, most of them through an Alberta numbered company. On Thursday, he said it was only about a million shares, although he didn't elaborate on what happened to the rest.  All week long, the Conservatives and New Democrats have accused the government of being in a conflict of interest created by a finance minister regulating an industry that includes a company in which he owns significant shares.  NDP MP Nathan Cullen has called on Dawson to investigate Morneau for spearheading pension reform legislation that could benefit Morneau Shepell and, through shares he still holds, the minister himself.  In the days after Morneau personally introduced that bill, the value of Morneau Shepell shares rose 4.8 per cent, Cullen said during question period, Morneau's first this week since the controversy exploded. The minister shrugged off Cullen, noting Dawson had already signed off on the arrangement.  The opposition charges have all but drowned out the government's efforts to address another, earlier controversy over its widely panned changes to small business taxes.  ""Of course, there's been a distraction this week,"" Morneau said earlier in the day during a news conference at a farm in the Ontario community of Erinsville, where he was trying to deliver good news: that the government would not proceed with a tax change that has angered farmers.  He said Ottawa will reconsider the proposal related to the conversion of income into capital gains after hearing concerns from farmers and fishers. The proposal raised fears about how it could hinder the intergenerational transfer of family business, like farms.","Finance Minister Bill Morneau, under siege from relentless opposition attacks over how he handled his personal fortune when he entered government in 2015, went on the offensive Thursday with a promise to sell off tens of millions of dollars worth of shares in the family business that bears his name.

An enhanced chance of meeting funding goals is achieved through the Trustee body working in partnership with the Fiduciary Manager who has the resources to offer a proactive approach to decision making both in terms of manager replacement (via the manager-of-managers model) and asset allocation changes. In practice this means that trustees can focus on key strategic issues whilst knowing that the Fiduciary Manager is accountable to the trustees for the overall performance of the fund.  Benefits of working with a Fiduciary Manager include:       --  Particular focus on funding goals of company and overall goals of         pension scheme by combining advice and implementation     --  Time savings allowing increased focus by trustees on strategic issues     --  Potential cost savings by working with one provider on an asset based         fee     --  The comfort of a single point of contact who is accountable for manager         selection decisions     --  Diversification amongst managers within asset classes      --  Continuous manager research, monitoring and replacement   About East of England  The East of England Co-operative Society is the largest independent retailer in East Anglia and has over 200 trading outlets which are located in 73 towns and villages, plus the three regional centres of Norwich, Ipswich and Colchester.  The Society has over 5,000 employees, of which approximately 1,400 are active members of the Society's two defined benefit pension schemes.  SOURCE SEI"
164,1100098,"What happened?     I WAS lucky to get interested in property at a relatively early age (21) and bought my first block of land in a very good suburb which gained in value beyond my expectations. This showed me that the capital growth of an investment was potentially worth more than term deposit interest, especially when rates are so low.     What's the best investment decision you've ever made?     Buying the block of land where my current house is situated in Pullenvale, near Brisbane. We were lucky enough to get acreage land but didn't have to pay today's inflated prices. Building an appropriate style house to suit the area has enhanced its value even more. Being our principal place of residence means no capital gains tax will have to be paid when we sell.     What about the worst?     Procrastinating. There have been two or three real estate opportunities that I did not proceed with where in hindsight we would have doubled their value in five years.     I should not have said ""no"" immediately and perhaps I should have found a way to purchase them.     What's the best piece of investment advice you've received?     To try to minimise your tax wherever possible, but don't be afraid to pay tax because this means you must be making a good income in order to have to pay it.     What advice would you give to an investor who's just starting out?     Education. The better informed a person is, the better decisions a person can make. Markets are uncertain, but if you understand them fully you are less likely to make mistakes or get taken in by shonky dealers. An organisation like the Australian Investors Association can help give you a market understanding and put you in touch with others who have the same interest.     How do you react when the markets get rocky?     I stick to my short-term and long-term strategies and try not to deviate from the initial plan. In saying that, I have sometimes moved my goal posts and I think you need to be aware of what is happening in the markets but be able and willing to adapt them if necessary. Long-term investments, in particular, make it easier to stay firm in your investments because most markets are cyclical, and to sell out when markets have crashed is a bit silly. If you can, you should try and wait for the recovery.     What's the biggest investment risk you've ever taken? And did it pay off?     Deciding to build my first home on the block of land that I had purchased. I did this at a young age, completely on my own, not knowing if I could ever afford to meet the repayments without getting a tenant. I was very lucky in that my income increased along with the markets, so by the time I sold about eight years later I had more than doubled my initial investment. It was very scary to take this sort of step without a partner to run things by.     What would you never do with your money?     I would never invest in ambiguous ventures like property development deals where they wrap up the deal by recommending their mates for the peripheral deals that are associated with property purchase. Things like recommending solicitors, property valuers, mortgage lenders etcetera. My philosophy is that if it looks too good to be true then it usually is.     Where do you source most of your investment information/research?     For real estate I use the local papers, internet and local knowledge, so I have a pretty good feel for price levels in the area. For other investments, I use newspapers and and magazines. In particular I like to read Property Investor magazine. For other financial information, AIA meetings, newsletters, seminars and their website are invaluable.     What, for you, are the most important attributes of a good financial planner?     I am lucky I don't need to use one but I would have to say that to be good and reputable in that industry you need to be able to give unbiased advice. I don't like the fact that a lot of advice is given on the back of receiving commissions.     What are your views on socially responsible, or ethical, investments?     It sounds good in theory to have a social conscience when making investment decisions. Everyone should be trying to help out in their own way but I feel everything has a price and I would not like to make a major investment decision driven by ethical reasons alone.     Would you feel comfortable about running a portfolio of individual direct shares?     Yes, I basically do that now, but I would like to expand that. I have always been a cautious investor who prefers bricks and mortar. However, I am diversifying into direct shares and equity trusts and term deposits. I have found that being involved in AIA has given me the confidence to branch out into other markets.     How do you feel about investing overseas?     I don't feel the need, and there is a lot to know to reduce the risk of this type of investment. Not only do you need to understand the market or company you are investing in but there are also major currency risks involved as well.   ","TRUE CONFESSIONS

165,897182,"Hurdles and sacrifices  The Index also reveals the most common hurdles recent first time buyers had to overcome and the sacrifices they made in order to buy their first home. The main challenge for nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of respondents was raising a deposit - one in five (20 per cent) had to wait between six to 10 years to save enough money. In order to do so, over a third (37 per cent) cut back on taking holidays and eating out.  Nearly one in 10 (9 per cent) found the actual process of securing a mortgage the biggest difficulty, and the same number (10 per cent) cited the whole buying process as the biggest problem. For a further 8 per cent of first time buyers it was the length of the purchase process.  Getting on the housing ladder  When asked what could be done to improve the situation, almost a third (32 per cent) recent first time buyers requested the issue of rising house prices to be addressed. For over one in three (34 per cent) respondents, simplifying the whole buying process would help, while three in ten (30 per cent) believe the situation would improve if better mortgage products were available.  In control of life  In the end though, the positives outweigh the negatives. Nearly three quarters (73 per cent) of recent first time buyers felt like they had reached adulthood when they got the keys to their first home, and almost seven in ten (69 per cent) found that putting their own stamp on their new home to be an empowering experience.  Three quarters (75 per cent) of recent first time buyers feel they are no longer wasting money on rent, and 70 per cent believe owning their own home gives them financial control.

167,222354,"First and foremost are new regulations and policies, led by the new fiduciary rule, said Charles Nelson, chief executive officer of retirement at Voya Financial. “Each company will approach it differently,” he said. “Some may utilize the best interest contract (BIC) exemption or retreat from offering certain services. At Voya, we will utilize the BIC where it is most appropriate.”  Another regulatory development is open multiple employer plans (MEPs), which have a chance of being “approved in Washington, and that could help us grow our industry,” Nelson said.  Second, is the growing recognition of the cost of employees not being retirement ready. “Many years ago, companies sought to limit their liabilities by freeing their defined benefit plans,” said Tina Wilson, senior vice president, head of retirement solutions innovation at MassMutual. “But that liability still exists if employees don’t have sufficient funds to retire and are financially trapped.”  Sponsors and their advisers need to ensure that participants are “funding their plan adequately,” Wilson said. “Typically, the CFO is not engaged in the plan. We looked at plans with 1,000 employees and found that, on average, it is costing them $2.7 million to $3 million a year in the liability of employees unable to retire. We must measure this cost” and call sponsors’ attention to it.  Third is the need to engineer a retirement plan for success. “401(k) plans were designed to be supplemental,” said Nelson, who then pointed to six ways advisers can help “DB-itize” defined contribution plans. Use automatic enrollment, he said, paired with qualified default investment alternatives (QDIAs) that place participants’ funds into appropriately diversified portfolios. “Optimize the match to ensure people are saving at the right levels. Use escalation, reenrollment and embrace income” options, he said.  NEXT: Outcomes  Fourth is the value of investments in driving outcomes. MassMutual has studied outcomes in detail and has learned for “savers early on, investments are irrelevant,” Wilson said. “Instead, it’s about how much you save. But at age 40, 45, investments become critical.” That’s why people at this age and older need to be invested in “target-date funds, managed accounts or custom portfolios that are a diversified default,” she said.  Fifth, it is important to apply behavioral science to retirement innovation. “Innovation is critical and we haven’t been that innovative with enrollment,” Nelson said. “We don’t think everything should be digital. Choose different platforms” for different touch points, he said.  Sixth, are data-driven asset allocation solutions. By this, Wilson said, the industry needs to embrace smart data platforms where demographics are tailored to “individualized circumstances to select [a certain] glidepath or custom allocation. It’s much more proscriptive on am individualized level.”  Seventh is weighing income replacement versus account balances. “Income is the new outcome,” Nelson said. “Plan sponsors are becoming increasingly focused on income, and that is how you are going to be measured going forward. But include all sources, including IRAs and Social Security.”  Eighth is finding solutions for income. “Income is also very personal,” Wilson said. “Solutions need to work for each individual. No one size fits all. It must be a set of solutions that are worked through an adviser, not a tool.”  Ninth is financial wellness that extends beyond the defined contribution plan. This means “holistic solutions to solve income stream needs. Income needs fluctuate in retirement, so solutions should be designed accordingly,” Nelson said.  Finally, participants need help navigating healthcare costs and building true financial wellness. “Because participants say healthcare costs prevent them from saving more for retirement, we need to talk about a benefits budget to optimize their spending and help them make better financial decisions,” Wilson said.","Executives from MassMutual and Voya Financial discussed trends driving the retirement plan industry.

169,1074733,"What is BPI Saying: Greg Baer, BPI President and CEO, issued the following statement:  Banks compete aggressively for consumers’ business, and any fees they charge are disclosed consistent with a regime mandated by Congress and administered by the CFPB. The Bureau’s RFI cites no data and provides no empirical analysis to support its overwrought assertions about “junk” or “surprise” bank fees, and remarkably fails to acknowledge that those fees are fully disclosed under a regime that the Bureau administers. Nor does the RFI seek meaningful input from commenters or suggestions on how to improve its regulations, preferring instead simply to solicit complaints.  What the CFPB Got Wrong:  The Request for Information issued by the Bureau:  1. Assumes fees are not transparently disclosed to consumers in advance. Banks are broadly required by various congressional mandates and agency regulations, many of which are directly administered by the CFPB, to provide customers with detailed disclosures for virtually all consumer financial products and services, up-front, including about fees charged.  2. Charges that the financial services industry is non-competitive. The already competitive banking industry has seen a significant increase in competition from online banks, FinTechs and other consumer financial product and service providers. Recent research demonstrates that the U.S. banking industry is much less concentrated than other industries that serve U.S. households.  Further, the vast framework requiring disclosure of virtually all fees further promotes competition for banking products and services.  3. Fails to acknowledge the benefits of financial products and services for consumers. Consumers enjoy 24-hour-a-day access to payment services and FDIC insurance of up to $250,000 on checking and savings accounts. They also benefit from protection against fraudulent charges, assistance with merchant disputes, access to reward programs, and interest-free loans on credit card products when balances are fully repaid every month. Many of these products come with features such as branch access, online banking capabilities and other innovations with an underlying cost to banks that consumers are generally provided without a fee.  4. Inaccurately asserts that most revenue earned by banks is from fees. Banks generate most earnings from net interest income — earnings obtained from the fundamental banking function of funding loans through deposits.  Additional Background:  The Bureau issued its Request for Information in January 2022. In the Request, the Bureau sought to outline several broad examples of what it incorrectly characterizes as “junk fees” while also likening these fees to those found outside of the banking industry, such as resort fees and concert ticket fees.

People who make contributions to an RRSP and pull the money out before retirement can end up paying more tax than what they first saved as a deduction. Avoid contributing RRSP unless you can commit the funds until retirement.     - Do consolidate your RRSP accounts. Some people have multiple RRSP accounts held at different financial institutions. They may have $10,000 at Institution A from a 2004 RRSP contribution, $6,000 at RRSP Institution B from a 2005 RRSP contribution, and $8,000 at Institution C from a 2006 RRSP contribution. This may result in additional RRSP fees being charged to you and result in more fees than you need to pay. More importantly, your investments become more difficult to manage. Consolidate your RRSP accounts at one institution for better management, to reduce fees and to open up more investment options.     - Don't underestimating life expectancy. All too often people in their 60s begin pulling money out of their RRSP solely to avoid paying a large tax bill if they were to pass away. We encourage people to plan for the most likely outcome rather than the worst-case scenario.     - Do name a beneficiary.

Bill Summary  (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://www.leg.state.co.us/billsummaries.)  A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to exempt property from the decedent's estate. On and after January 1, 2012, the dollar limit for exempt property to which a surviving spouse is entitled is increased from $26,000 to $78,000. On and after January 1, 2012, the dollar limit for the family allowance taken out of the estate for the maintenance of the family during the administration of the estate is increased from $24,000 to $72,000.  The current law provides for an annual cost of living adjustment for exempt property and for the family allowance. The bill suspends those cost of living adjustments for one year when the increase in the dollar amounts due to this bill takes effect.  Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:  SECTION 1. 15-11-403, Colorado Revised Statutes, is amended to read:  15-11-403. Exempt property.

Ryan Bourne, head of economic research at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: ""A host of out-of-work benefits have been uprated by 5.2%, much more than average pay growth, and that obviously has problems for work incentives.  ""There are rumours that Iain Duncan Smith [the work and pensions secretary] may freeze benefits for two years to save around £7bn but that would bring big political difficulties [concerning the treatment of] the poorest people in society.""  George Osborne, the chancellor, is expected to lay out any proposals in his autumn statement on December 5.  According to figures released by the Office for National Statistics, spending on net social benefits in October was 7.7% higher than in October 2011. Since April, the start of the current financial year, spending has been 5.9% higher than last year.  The bulk of the extra spending was triggered by a formula linking benefit increases in April to the rate of consumer price index (CPI) inflation the previous September. In September 2011 the CPI rate was 5.2%. Welfare spending was also pushed up by the 30% leap in a single year in the number of people turning 65 and becoming eligible for state pensions as the baby boomers hit retirement age. More than 720,000 people turned 65 last year, the biggest number in the country's history.  The cost of state pensions rose from £69.8bn in 2010-11 to £74.2bn last year. Official estimates predict that it will rise to £79.8bn this year.  Some of the biggest rises were for people on employment and support allowance, up from £2.16bn last year to a forecast £4.1bn. Disability living allowance payments are on track to rise by £1bn this year.  This weekend the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said it had taken steps to curb housing benefit payments, which doubled in cash terms under Labour between 2000 and 2010, reaching £21bn. The DWP said without Duncan Smith's reforms the cost would rise to £25bn by 2015-16. The package of measures being introduced will create savings of £1bn by 2015-16.

Peter went through New World Mortgages, the phone and internet lender launched in Britain by parent company Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 'The application process was easy and I had no problems raising the funds or finding tenants,' he says.    Peter is getting income from rent and expects to see good capital growth if house prices continue to rise.    But can property investments really outperform shares?    In its latest lettings report, which takes in the views of agents across the country, Bradford & Bingley Lettings Agents says that renting out a flat gives the owner a return of up to 10 per cent of its value a year, though this is before the cost of management fees, maintenance and insurance.    The average annual income after these costs is seven per cent, according to B&B still higher than most bank or building society savings accounts, which rarely top six per cent. And the property market also offers significant potential for capital growth.    Meanwhile, share dividends are providing less than three per cent and capital values are falling with the spread of international equity turmoil.    John Crossley, head of Bradford & Bingley Lettings Agents, says: 'While rentals account for about 11 per cent of the UK housing market, they are on the increase. There is growing demand from tenants for properties to rent rather than buy because modern living requires more mobility and young, high-earning professionals seem to want more flexibility.' Other factors are also making experts optimistic about the buy-to-let market.    Roger Hillier, product development manager of lender Mortgage Express, says: 'A rising number of divorces is creating new households needing somewhere to live. Also, first-time buyers are considerably older now than those in the Eighties, which means more people are renting for longer.' Since their introduction in 1996, buyto-let mortgages have brought interest rates in line with standard mortgages, rather than forcing buyers of investment properties to borrow at steep commercial rates.    THE latest big name lender to enter the market is Cheltenham & Gloucester, which offers loans direct to the public and through Lloyds TSB branches.    It provides property investor deals with an interest rate of 7.25 per cent, though borrowers must have a deposit of at least 20 per cent of the purchase price.    Most buy-to-let lenders are like C&G and require borrowers to stump up hefty deposits before loans are agreed.    But they are becoming more flexible about the amount they will offer.    Most will now take rental income into account when loans are offered, while in the past they based the amount they would lend almost entirely on applicants' salaries.    Crossley warns that buyers need funds to cover periods when they might not have tenants, and should also be aware that it can take a long time to realise the asset if they decide to sell when the property market is falling.

How much is an NHS prescription season ticket  An NHS prescription season ticket -officially known as a prescription prepayment certificate PPC -is now worth £108.10.  Those concerned about making such a large payment in one go should note that they do not have to pay it all at once -instead you can pay by direct debit in 10 instalments of £10.81 each.  With prices rises looming in April, it is entirely possible that the price of the PPC will go up. By how much it is not yet known, so it is recommended that those wanting to purchase their certificate should do so before the April deadline.  Will the price of my prescription go up  It has not yet been confirmed if the price of NHS prescriptions will go up, but will likely do so if the current trend continues.  A single prescription currently costs £9.35 and prescriptions have gone up by 26.35% over the last 10 years.  A continuing of this trend would see another 2.63% increase this year, meaning prescriptions could go up to £9.57 in the next few weeks.

177,1051777,"All the big banks have funds at the Federal Reserve, and the Fed's pronouncements on rates set how much interest those banks can charge one another to borrow money to meet reserve requirements. It's the banking world's equivalent of an emergency fund. (This is why Wall Street watchers sit vigil in anticipation of the board's every utterance.) That, in turn, dictates terms for savers and borrowers seeking the best ones on deposits and loans.  Now that the Fed has made its pronouncement and the interest rate winds have changed direction, the next step for consumers depends on which side of the saving-borrowing divide they stand. For guidance, NerdWallet's in-house experts respond to the most pressing questions from savers, homeowners, home shoppers, credit card holders and investors.  1. What impact will the rate hike have on my retirement savings?  Predicting the effect the federal funds rate increase has on any individual investor's retirement savings depends a lot on his or her near-term plans for the money and what's in his or her portfolio: Large U.S.-based companies? Foreign stocks? Dividend-payers? Indexed investments? Individual stocks concentrated in particular sectors?  When a rate increase is expected (as this one has been for many months), the effect on the overall market is usually baked into stock prices already, at least partially. It's reasonable to expect at least a bit of short-term stock market anxiety in response to the news, since Wall Street is notoriously easy to spook. Intermittent volatility in exchange for higher potential returns on your long-term savings is par for the course. The stock market's post-election dive and quick turnaround race to all-time highs is just the most recent example.  2. Should I adjust my investing strategy?  In NerdWallet's new end-of-year financial savings survey, 17% of Americans said that stock market volatility is one of their top sources of financial anxiety. Our advice for how to handle potential market turbulence remains the same as it always has been for long-term investors: Take a deep breath, don't make any sudden moves and concentrate on the things you can control. (Fiddling around with a Roth IRA savings calculator is a more worthwhile distraction than fiddling with the investments in your account.) Some other suggestions if you need something to keep your hands busy until 'business as usual' resumes:  * Revisit your original investment plan: Do the effects of higher interest rates change your long-term expectations for any of the investments in your portfolio? In the near term, they might, especially if you're invested in stocks, exchange-traded funds or mutual funds in industries that are in expansion mode (where the higher costs of borrowing can influence the ability to invest in future growth) or heavily reliant on consumers' ability to finance purchases (think homes and cars). But what about longer term? If your original investment thesis still stands, then stand by your investments.  * Check up on your asset allocation: A well-balanced portfolio that contains a diversified mix of assets helps investors sleep well through even the most raucous Federal Reserve Board meeting. Find a quiet spot to review your retirement portfolio's allocation. But don't be too quick to move things around in response to what is likely just a short-term blip. (Here's more on what it means to diversify and guidance on four ways to rebalance your portfolio.)  * Make the most of money you need in the next three to 10 years: Don't forget to consider your short-term savings as part of your overall portfolio. Any money earmarked for upcoming expenses (such as the first handful of years for retirement or a down payment on a home) should be invested in more predictable and less volatile investments than the stock market.  * Take advantage of market volatility by investing whenever the market takes a hit: Running toward the wreckage with your money takes nerves of steel. But the rewards of following through on the first part of the 'buy low, sell high' rule of thumb are well worth it. You don't have to dive into the discount bin with all of your money at once, either. Adding to your positions over time (aka dollar-cost averaging) is one of the best investing strategies. See how even small savings increases can affect your future way of life with a retirement calculator.  3. What does the rate hike mean for my savings account?  Rates on savings accounts might go up, but they won't jump overnight, and increases wouldn't be significant. Banks consider many factors when setting savings rates, and a Fed rate increase doesn't play a huge role in those decisions. Still, a bank typically will look at how its competitors respond to a Fed increase, and if other financial institutions keep savings rates low, it won't have much incentive to increase its own rates. But if banks start raising their rates, others will likely feel compelled to do the same to stay competitive.  It's probably best to keep your expectations low. When the Fed announced its hike in December 2015, many of the biggest banks reacted in the same way: They raised loan rates and left savings rates unchanged. This boosted banks' margins.  4. Will the rate hike affect my CDs?  Standard CDs will be affected in much the same way that savings accounts will: Rates might go up over time, but not by a lot. Keep in mind that most standard CDs come with fixed interest rates, so even if your bank's rates do go up, your CDs' annual percentage yields won't change.  Some banks, however, offer bump-up CDs that let customers request a rate increase if the bank's rates rise. In most cases, customers can exercise this option only once during a CD's term. These types of CDs usually have lower interest rates than fixed-rate certificates, and many have higher deposit requirements. Still, if you have one, keep track of your bank's rates. If they go up, ask your financial institution to adjust your CD accordingly.  5. Is the interest rate on my credit cards going up?  Probably. Interest rates on credit cards typically rise or fall with the prime rate, which is directly affected by the Fed's action. When the Fed boosted rates by 0.25 percentage point in December 2015, most major issuers raised the annual percentage rates on their cards by an equal amount within a month or so. If your rate is going up, you might not even hear about it from your credit card company. Although card issuers usually have to give you 45 days' notice of an increase in your APR, there's an exception for increases triggered by a change in the prime rate. So keep an eye on the APRs listed on your credit card statement.  A higher APR on your credit card means it will cost more to carry debt, although how much more depends on your balance. Your APR is a factor in how your minimum payment is calculated, so that could go up as well. Regardless of the effect in dollar terms, reducing your credit card debt is always a wise move.  6. How will a rate hike affect my mortgage?  Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates rose more than half a point (0.50%) in the four weeks following the election of Donald Trump, according to the NerdWallet Mortgage Rate Index. Rates are solidly over 4% for the first time this year. Considering a $300,000, 30-year fixed rate mortgage, each half-point increase adds close to $100 a month to your payment.  So, that's already happened.  » MORE: Calculate your monthly mortgage payment  With additional Fed rate hikes expected next year, mortgage rates may have as much as another half point to go. That would put home loan interest rates just under 5% by the end of 2017. Refinance activity has already taken a hit, as rates have climbed to their highest levels since July 2015.  And that's before Republicans begin implementing their stated agenda to reduce the government's role in the mortgage market. Those moves could also cause mortgage rates to edge higher, though it might be some time before the Trump administration gets around to its mortgage market reform.  * If you're already a homeowner with a fixed-rate mortgage, you're all good. Your rate is set.  * If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, you'll likely see your payments increase over the next year, depending on how often your rate resets. Keep an eye on mortgage rates and consider moving to a fixed-rate loan. You may want to begin the mortgage shopping process soon if you intend to stay in your home for a few years.  * If you have a home equity line of credit, it's a good time to consider your options. You may want to convert it to a fixed-rate home equity loan, or budget for paying off your line of credit before rates move much higher.  7. Should I worry if I'm shopping for a home?  Buying a home depends on so many different factors "" how much house you can afford, mortgage rates and home prices in your area. Of course, there are also your family's needs, your job situation, the down payment and the rest.  It's hard to time all of that perfectly. But here's the thing: If you're all set to buy, don't let moderately higher mortgage rates worry you. Proceed according to your plan. While the long-term outlook seems to indicate steadily rising interest rates, we're building on very low ground. You know that whole 'historically low mortgage rates' thing you've heard for the past few years? Yeah, we're still there.  It will take a long climb higher before mortgage rates are back to their 44-year historical average of 8%. In the meantime, you'll be in the money with a 4% or 5% home loan. Even a 6% mortgage is a significant discount to the average.  Yes, your buying power can be affected by higher interest rates, but that can also be offset by the better wages and greater employment opportunities of an improving economy.

178,819848,"Gustavo Morles was a faculty member of the University of Phoenix and participated in their 401(k) plan. In 2010, he was unemployed and having some financial trouble. He took distributions from both his 401(k) plan and IRA, and used some of that money to pay his rent and avoid eviction.  Morles received a $6,893 distribution from his 401(k) plan in 2010. The plan distribution was reported to him and to the IRS on Form 1099-R, which showed the entire distribution amount as taxable (i.e., there were no after-tax funds). He was under age 59 ½ at the time of the plan distribution.  PAYING THE RENT  Morles also had a small IRA that he used to pay his rent. His IRA was funded in 2008 with a $1,000 contribution, but he didn’t take a deduction for that contribution on his 2008 federal income tax return. He only had one IRA and never made another IRA contribution or took a distribution before he took a $951 early distribution in 2010. He received a Form 1099-R from the IRA custodian reporting the distribution.  Morles’ 2010 taxes were done by a paid tax preparer, but neither his 401(k) nor his IRA distribution was reported as income for the year. As a result, the IRS sent him a tax bill for the unreported income.  In a notice of deficiency dated April 2012, the IRS determined that Morles owed $4,789 as a result of his errors. Morles believed the distributions were tax- and penalty-free, and the issue wound up in Tax Court, where Morles represented himself. He argued that neither distribution was taxable because he was suffering economic hardship, including the threat of eviction.  The court ruled that both distributions should be reported as income and that the 10% early distribution penalty applied. It determined that the 401(k) distribution was fully taxable because there were no after-tax funds in the plan. The court also rejected Morles’ argument that hardship distributions from a company plan are tax-free because he provided no evidence that the tax code offers such treatment — probably because it doesn’t.  The IRS believed the entire IRA distribution was taxable, since Morles had never completed a Form 8606 to report his nondeductible IRA contribution. Morles, however, believed it was tax-free because his IRA distribution was less than his initial $1,000 IRA contribution. In his mind, the IRA distribution was nothing more than a tax-free return of his investment. The court allowed the IRA basis and ruled that the IRA distribution was partially taxable and partially tax-free under the  pro-rata tax rule.  Although Morles did not properly report his nondeductible IRA contribution, the court said he could prove that he had basis (after-tax funds) through other means. Furthermore, it indicated that there is nothing in the tax code that explicitly prevents an IRA owner from claiming basis that was not initially reported correctly.  The court noted that Morles did not take a deduction for his IRA contribution at the time it was made. Accordingly, his $1,000 contribution for 2008 was a nondeductible IRA contribution that created basis.  Although Morles only had one IRA that was funded solely by the $1,000 nondeductible contribution, it appears that his IRA had investment gains. Those gains are pretax funds, which are taxable and distributed ratably with his after-tax funds under the pro-rata formula.  Ultimately, the court ordered Morles and the IRS to redo their math and take into account the after-tax funds that were part of his $951 distribution.  The court agreed with the IRS that the 10% penalty applied to both distributions because Morles was under age 59 ½ at the time. Since his 401(k) distribution was fully taxable, the 10% penalty applied to that entire amount. On the other hand, since the court ruled that Morles’ IRA distribution was partially tax-free, the 10% penalty only applied to the taxable portion of his distribution.  REPORTING AFTER-TAX AMOUNTS  When after-tax funds are contributed to an IRA, they must be reported on IRS Form 8606. By reporting such amounts, the IRS knows certain funds in the IRA have already been taxed, and cannot be taxed a second time when they are later distributed.  After-tax funds can be added to an IRA in one of two ways: either via nondeductible IRA contributions or via rollovers of after-tax retirement funds that were held in an employer plan, such as a 401(k). Once inside an IRA, after-tax funds can generally only be withdrawn under the pro-rata rule, where each dollar withdrawn is partially taxable and partially tax-free, based on the percentage of after-tax money in the account.  REESTABLISH BASIS  If clients add after-tax money to their IRA during the year, they must file a Form 8606. However, failing to timely file Form 8606 does not automatically mean a client will be unable to claim that a portion of their distribution consists of after-tax funds and thus is nontaxable. They’ll just need to find a way to prove how much of their distribution, in fact, comprises after-tax funds.  One way to find any unreported nondeductible contributions is by checking IRA statements. You may also be able to track down Form 5498 (IRA Contribution Information) for prior years, which would show if any IRA contributions were made.  Once you figure out which years your client made contributions, look at the tax return for applicable years to see if a deduction was taken. If you find a year where an IRA contribution was made but no deduction was taken, then you can assume that a nondeductible IRA contribution was made. Note that nondeductible IRA contributions started in 1987, so there’s no point in going back and scouring statements and returns before that.  Assuming you can prove prior basis, clients may want to file Form 8606 to bring it up to date. Clients should be sure to keep any supporting documentation in case the IRS questions the newly discovered basis.  Advisors can help clients avoid a double tax on IRA basis by checking to see if they made nondeductible IRA contributions and have reported them correctly.  Updating Form 8606 basis information will be helpful to clients and their tax preparers, as well.    Ed Slott, a CPA in Rockville Centre, N.Y., is a Financial Planning contributing writer and an IRA distribution expert, professional speaker and author of several books on IRAs.

REPORTING AFTER-TAX AMOUNTS  When after-tax funds are contributed to an IRA, they must be reported on IRS Form 8606. By reporting such amounts, the IRS knows certain funds in the IRA have already been taxed, and cannot be taxed a second time when they are later distributed.  After-tax funds can be added to an IRA in one of two ways: either via nondeductible IRA contributions or via rollovers of after-tax retirement funds that were held in an employer plan, such as a 401(k). Once inside an IRA, after-tax funds can generally only be withdrawn under the pro-rata rule, where each dollar withdrawn is partially taxable and partially tax-free, based on the percentage of after-tax money in the account.  REESTABLISH BASIS  If clients add after-tax money to their IRA during the year, they must file a Form 8606. However, failing to timely file Form 8606 does not automatically mean a client will be unable to claim that a portion of their distribution consists of after-tax funds and thus is nontaxable. They’ll just need to find a way to prove how much of their distribution, in fact, comprises after-tax funds.  One way to find any unreported nondeductible contributions is by checking IRA statements. You may also be able to track down Form 5498 (IRA Contribution Information) for prior years, which would show if any IRA contributions were made.  Once you figure out which years your client made contributions, look at the tax return for applicable years to see if a deduction was taken. If you find a year where an IRA contribution was made but no deduction was taken, then you can assume that a nondeductible IRA contribution was made. Note that nondeductible IRA contributions started in 1987, so there’s no point in going back and scouring statements and returns before that.  Assuming you can prove prior basis, clients may want to file Form 8606 to bring it up to date. Clients should be sure to keep any supporting documentation in case the IRS questions the newly discovered basis.  Advisors can help clients avoid a double tax on IRA basis by checking to see if they made nondeductible IRA contributions and have reported them correctly.  Updating Form 8606 basis information will be helpful to clients and their tax preparers, as well.    Ed Slott, a CPA in Rockville Centre, N.Y., is a Financial Planning contributing writer and an IRA distribution expert, professional speaker and author of several books on IRAs.

181,684910," “There’s a lack of awareness that Medicaid is really the safety net in Minnesota for so many of our seniors,” said Minnesota Department of Human Services Commissioner Emily Piper, whose agency manages the $11 billion program. The proposed health care bill would end the expansion of Medicaid, allowed under the ACA and implemented by Minnesota. It would also fundamentally change the way states receive federal aid to help care for some of their most vulnerable citizens. The proposal aims to save billions in federal spending by ending open-ended payments to states and establishing a maximum payment on each enrollee. Minnesota would fare worse than most other states because caps are based on medical costs, which are among the lowest in the nation due in part to programs that limit expensive hospital stays and nursing home care. The state is in the process of calculating potential losses under the Senate plan. Under the House bill, which appears to be similar through 2025, the state faces a potential loss of about $2.3 billion in federal funding in the first 18 months and up to $11.4 billion by 2025. Capping federal Medicaid dollars will take needed bloat out of the system and give power back to the states, Republicans backers of the bill argue. But others worry that shifting the burden to states will have an outsized impact on seniors, whose cost of care is growing. “It’s not just the seniors who rely on Medicaid, their whole family does,” said Piper. “Their adult children, who are working and saving to send their kids to college, or who are raising young children who can’t take on the additional responsibility of providing day-to-day, 24-hour care of aging grandparents.” Seventy percent of people over 75 will spend time in a nursing home or need access to long-term care services in their lifetime. Medicare, the government’s health insurance for seniors, doesn’t cover assisted living, extended stays in nursing homes or the costs to hire someone to help with cooking, bathing or managing medications for months or years at a time. Thus, Medicaid serves as a safeguard for growing numbers of middle-class elders, particularly those with challenging illnesses such as dementia and heart disease, who rely on the program after they’ve drained their personal savings. Half of Minnesota’s nursing home residents are currently covered by Medical Assistance. “The general public thinks of this as an issue for some, and not others,” said Jennifer DeCubellis, Hennepin County’s deputy commissioner of Health and Human Services. “What we try to do as a state is provide additional supports to keep people in their homes longer. We know how critical that is to quality of life, for keeping families together. But it’s also an expense for the state. Nursing home care is very expensive.” Over the decades, Minnesota has launched a bipartisan effort to get waivers from the federal government to make flexible use of Medicaid dollars to serve seniors in their homes or communities. Those funds now pay for a broad umbrella of services: help with such daily activities as bathing, grooming and toileting; house calls by nurses or case managers to help manage medications; adult day services; meals; transportation to doctor’s appointments; and household chores. Last year, nearly 30,000 Minnesotans were served by the Elderly Waiver program. The state spent an average of $1,300 to $1,600 per person a month, compared to the average monthly cost of a nursing home of $6,700. “The proposed cuts will have an unfortunate impact on the progress we’ve made,” said Erin Parrish of AARP Minnesota, citing a recent AARP study that ranked the state No. 2 in care for seniors and their caregivers. “The number of Minnesotans turning 65 this decade will be greater than the past four decades combined. The cap doesn’t keep pace with changing demographics.” Minnesota has pushed harder than most other states to try to keep seniors out of institutions. More than three-quarters of the state’s Medicaid spending for long-term supports and services goes toward programs that seniors get at home or in the community. But these are optional services. Faced with less money, advocates fear the state would be forced to cut back or eliminate these programs. “There aren’t many choices at the state level,” said Paula Hart, president and CEO of the Minnesota and Wisconsin chapter of Volunteers of America, which serves more than 8,000 seniors in community settings, affordable housing and group homes. “They’d really be forced to make a ‘Sophie’s Choice.’ Do you not provide services to people? Do you cut the services they get? Do you cut rates to providers? None of those are good solutions.” Informal caregivers likely will feel collateral damage, advocates warn. Family, friends and neighbors provide 92 percent of long-term care needed by older adults in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Human Services. This unpaid care is worth an estimated $7.8 billion a year, more than the state spends on nursing homes and long-term services and supports through Medicaid. “It feels like we’re pulling the rug out from underneath families and seniors,” said Kari Thurlow, an executive at LeadingAge Minnesota, which represents senior housing providers. “If we don’t have Medicaid in place, not only will it make it hard for seniors without assets and income to find services, it likely will mean more out-of-pocket expenses for their adult children. There’s a trickle-down effect.” Organizations that provide senior housing and services say too much already is being balanced on the backs of those who can afford private pay. Federal cuts will make it even more difficult to pay competitive rates for those eldercare workers who provide front-line care for the aged and infirm with complex needs. “Right now, you have people in our industry who are hardly making ends meet,” said Mary Jo Thorne, a regional director of housing for Augustana Care. “But you get to the point where the provider will say, ‘I can’t lose money. I can’t do this anymore.’ Where will these people go? That’s what worries me most.” Hennepin County’s DeCubellis said the county is prepared to make “the business case” for continuing to fund programs that keep people out of institutions, even if the menu of Medicaid-eligible services shrinks. Her bigger concern is the politics. “Making the longer-term investment in what’s right for people and what’s gong to sustain communities and keep communities and individuals stabilized doesn’t always fit in a short political cycle,” she said.

182,424952,"The right one for you will depend on how much you want to save and what you can afford to put aside.  The Sun’s Money team each took on six challenges to find out how they work and crucially how easy they are to stick to.  Combined we managed to tuck away £371 in one month.  While some challenges claim to save you hundreds of pounds a year  Brits tucked away more than ever during lockdown as coronavirus measures curbed spending, according to the Office For National Statistics.  But as the rules eased and many face income cuts, saving cash became a bit trickier.  There isn’t a right or wrong way to save.  Where to put your savings  NOW isn't a great time for savers as interest rates are at record low meaning you won't make much money on your cash.  The Bank of England has even hinted that it could take the base rate – what banks and lenders use to set their own interest rates – below zero.  This could see banks and building societies charge savers a fee to hold their cash. We’ve put together a guide on how to protect your finances if this happens.  For now, here are some examples of the top paying accounts available today:  * Easy-access – You won’t be charged for withdrawing cash from an easy-access account but typically interest rates are lower to reflect this. The top paying account today is 0.96% with Coventry Building Society.  * Notice savings – Good for those who know they’ll need to access their cash but not sure when, say for example if you’re saving for a house deposit. You will be able to withdraw your money but you have to give set notice first, say 90 days. The top rate today is 1.12% on an account with DF Captial.  * Fixed-rate – These typically offer better rates but you’ll have to lock away your cash for the agreed term or face paying a penalty to withdraw it early. Here are some examples of the top-rates: – One-year fixed – 1.18% with DF Captial– Two-year fixed – 1.15% with Aldermore– Five-year fixed – 1.5% with UBL UK  * Cash Isa – These are tax-free savings accounts, meaning you get to keep all of the interest earned on savings set aside in a year. This year, the rate is set at £20,000. Like savings accounts, there are a number of different types available, such as fixed-rates and easy access. Here are some examples of the top-rates: – Easy-access – 0.96% with Coventry BS– One-year fixed – 0.82% with Charter Savings Bank– Two-year fixed – 1% with Cambridge Building Society– Five-year fixed – 1.4% with UBL UK  * NS&I Premium Bonds – Instead of being paid interest, Premium Bond savers purchase bonds worth £1 each, which are entered into a monthly cash prize draw. Prizes vary from £25 to £1million but the odds of winning have recently been dramatically reduced, meaning you also run a high risk of earning nothing.  Experts recommend setting up a standing order for a fixed amount to leave your account on payday and then taking a challenge on top.  Moneycomms.co.uk personal finance expert Andrew Hagger said: “The main thing to ask yourself is will your actions save a sufficient amount and can you keep your savings challenge going for the long term?  “In some cases I fear that people may lose interest and give up after a few weeks or months.”  “Sometimes these less traditional savings methods are important first steps for new savers who eventually grasp the savings habit and then start to save bigger sums to help them achieve their dreams, for example, for a new car, holiday or house deposit.”  Thinking of taking on a money challenge? Here’s our verdict on some of the most popular ones:  Bingo challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: £1,200 (if you restart the same card above every month)  * We saved: £100  The 2020 bingo challenge helps you put aside £1,378 a year by saving a certain amount a week and crossing it off on the board.  It was created to help people who struggle to save easily, but also has flexibility for weeks when you don’t have a lot of spare cash.  You need to find a Bingo card you like and then each week you save one of the amounts.  Our saver says: As the challenge was only for one month I set myself a goal of £100 and made my own board by picking random numbers, low and high.  Personally, I needed the visual reminder so stuck it up on my wall – it felt satisfying every time I physically crossed off the numbers too.  The perk of this trick is there’s no set days that you have to put money aside – just make sure all of the numbers are completed by the end of the month.  It meant on the days I didn’t have any cash to spare I didn’t feel pressured to put any into my savings account.  I averaged around two payments a week and paired a really low amount with one of the higher numbers so I didn’t feel I was being left without.  But I left £18 and the £7 to the last week, which was quite a push at the end of the month.  Seeing the £100 in my bank account was worth it. I would try this again as it turns a chore into a game.  Weather challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: Potentially hundreds  * We saved: £95  The idea behind the weather savings challenge is that you put aside an amount equal to whatever the highest temperature is that week.  One degree Celsius is equal to £1, so if the temperature reaches 16C that week you’ll need to put £16 into savings.  Our saver says:  I never imagined the UK would get soaring temperatures when I picked the weather savings challenge, but there we were in mid-September with a mini-heatwave.  On the upside it did help add extra cash to my savings pot. I set a reminder on my phone to nudge me to save the money, otherwise you could easily forget.  If you do forget (and I did on the last week) you can use a website called timeanddate.com to review temperatures from the previous week.  It would be interesting to do this over a longer period of time and see how it changes seasonally.  I imagine it would be helpful to start in January when the temperatures are low and then build up.  Round up challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: £445  * We saved: £25.79  Rounding up your purchases to the nearest pound and saving the rest could see you put away an average of £1.22 a day – or £445.30 a year – according to Which?.  There are plenty of apps and bank services out there that will automatically do this for you, so you don’t have to do the maths.  For example, high street banks, like Halifax, Lloyds, Bank of Scotland, and digital banks, such as Starling and Monzo, let customers switch on this feature within the app.  Our saver says:  I used my existing bank account with Starling to do the round-up challenge.  It was easy to do given the app has a tool that automatically rounds up your transactions and transfers the cash to a separate savings pot.  You don’t really notice the extra pennies on top of each transaction, so it’s a handy way to boost your savings.  Over the course of just over a month, I saved £25.79.  It’s definitely something I’ll consider carrying on with, although the challenge alone isn’t enough for me to reach my savings targets.  I’d recommend it as an extra way to save cash or as a test if you feel like you can’t afford to save.  But if you’re saving for something big, such as a property, you’ll need to do more than just round up your purchases or it’ll take a very long time to get a deposit together.  Money saving challenges  IF you'll struggle to save a fiver a day for 100 days before Christmas, why not give a different savings challenge a try instead?  Here’s a rundown of some of the most popular schemes:  * Weather saving challenge – Save the amount equal to whatever the highest temperature was that week. £1 = 1C.  * 1p challenge  – save 1p a day for everyday of the year, but it increase the amount by 1p each day. So day one you save 1p, 2p on day two and 3p on day three. When you reach 100 days you start adding a £1 coin each day too, while this increases to a £2 coin each day plus pennies at 200 days, and £3 each day on top of pennies at day 300.  * 20p a day challenge – Start by putting 20p in savings, then increase the amount by 20p every day. For example, the first week will look like this: 20p, 40p, 60p, 80p, £1, £1.20, £1.40.  * £5 a week challenge – Like the 20p challenge, put aside £5 a week and increase it by a fiver each week. Eg £5, £10, £15, £20  * Round-up challenge  – Every time you buy something, round up the purchase to the nearest £1 and put the difference in a savings account. Eg. You pay £2.60, so you put 40p in savings. You can use an app such as Monzo or Starling to do this.  * Bingo challenge  – Here you have a bingo card with different numbers on it and you tick them off when you’ve put that amount in your savings account. It can be ad hoc but you have to tick them all off by the end of the month.  * Monday to Sunday  challenge – With this challenge, you simply save £1 on Monday, £2 on Tuesday and so on until the weekend where you don’t save on Saturday or Sunday.  * 365 day challenge  – Every Sunday you put aside £1, followed by £2 on Monday, £3 on Wednesday and so on. On Saturday you’ll put away £7, and then the process repeats and you’ll put aside £1 on Sunday as the new week begins.  Monday to Friday challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: £780  * We saved: £60  If you like having weekends off then the Monday to Friday challenge could be the one for you.  You kick the week off by putting £1 into savings and then increasing the amount you put in by £1 every day, for example, on Tuesday it’s £2 and Wednesday it’s £3.  By the end of the week you will have put aside £15 in total – then you get Saturday and Sunday off.  Our saver says: I’m terrible at carrying cash, so I ended up setting up a pot on Monzo after one week when I ran out of physical money.  I wish I could say I remembered to save daily, but I usually ended up forgetting and would make a transfer once a week of how much I should have put away, so £15.  I think that’s quite a lot to put away weekly and I’m not sure I’d have been able to keep up with it over a year.  But over four weeks, I ended up building up £60 in my Monzo pot, which I was pretty pleased with.  Give something up challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: £489.60  * We saved: £40.80  You’d be surprised at how much those small every day spends add up to – and how much you’d save if you gave them up.  This can be anything from your daily coffee, weekly takeaway or a TV subscription.  We’ve previously spoken to first-time buyers who’ve used this method to save hundreds towards the mortgage deposit – but how did it work out for our saver?  Our saver says: Instead of popping in for my morning coffee at the station on the way to work, I made one at home and took it with me in a reusable cup.  Wearing a mask makes it awkward to drink a cup of coffee on the train so sipping my own homemade fix on the walk to the station was simple to adjust to.  Giving up takeaway coffee was also easier because I had already gotten out of the habit of buying them during lockdown.  At £2.55 a pop for my usual takeaway Costa coffee – a flat white with almond milk and a 25p discount for bringing my own cup – I saved £40.80 this month.  I didn’t squirrel away the money I saved each time but that would be a good idea for anyone struggling to stick to it so they can see the money building up.  I knew I was saving money but adding it up at the end I was surprised just how much because it felt like small amounts each time.  Add £5 a week challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: £650  * We saved: £50  Stick to the add £5 a week challenge and you could end up with a tidy £50 in your savings account – that’s if you manage to keep with it.  Like the Monday to Friday challenge, you increase the amount that goes into savings as time goes on, in this case you add a fiver on every week.  Starting at £5 in the first week, increase it to £10 in the second, £15 in the third and £20 in the final week.  You then reset it every month to keep the amount you put into savings affordable.  Our saver says: This savings challenge really didn’t work for me.  Because the amount you squirrel away increases each week it means you can’t set-up a weekly direct debit to siphon off the money directly into your savings account to stop you spending it and I would never remember to do this manually.  I also rarely carry cash so it wasn’t simply a case of putting aside the money into a piggy bank each week.  I’ve instead set-up a monthly direct debit to add an affordable set amount to a Stocks and Shares Isa each month.","SAVINGS challenges are a great way to get into the habit of putting aside cash – and you could save hundreds of pounds a year.

SAVINGS challenges are a great way to get into the habit of putting aside cash – and you could save hundreds of pounds a year.

From the Bingo to Monday to Friday savings, the idea is that you set yourself a challenge based on a set of rules to squirrel away your pennies.
The right one for you will depend on how much you want to save and what you can afford to put aside.  The Sun’s Money team each took on six challenges to find out how they work and crucially how easy they are to stick to.  Combined we managed to tuck away £371 in one month.  While some challenges claim to save you hundreds of pounds a year  Brits tucked away more than ever during lockdown as coronavirus measures curbed spending, according to the Office For National Statistics.  But as the rules eased and many face income cuts, saving cash became a bit trickier.  There isn’t a right or wrong way to save.  Where to put your savings  NOW isn't a great time for savers as interest rates are at record low meaning you won't make much money on your cash.  The Bank of England has even hinted that it could take the base rate – what banks and lenders use to set their own interest rates – below zero.  This could see banks and building societies charge savers a fee to hold their cash. We’ve put together a guide on how to protect your finances if this happens.  For now, here are some examples of the top paying accounts available today:  * Easy-access – You won’t be charged for withdrawing cash from an easy-access account but typically interest rates are lower to reflect this. The top paying account today is 0.96% with Coventry Building Society.  * Notice savings – Good for those who know they’ll need to access their cash but not sure when, say for example if you’re saving for a house deposit. You will be able to withdraw your money but you have to give set notice first, say 90 days. The top rate today is 1.12% on an account with DF Captial.  * Fixed-rate – These typically offer better rates but you’ll have to lock away your cash for the agreed term or face paying a penalty to withdraw it early. Here are some examples of the top-rates: – One-year fixed – 1.18% with DF Captial– Two-year fixed – 1.15% with Aldermore– Five-year fixed – 1.5% with UBL UK  * Cash Isa – These are tax-free savings accounts, meaning you get to keep all of the interest earned on savings set aside in a year. This year, the rate is set at £20,000. Like savings accounts, there are a number of different types available, such as fixed-rates and easy access. Here are some examples of the top-rates: – Easy-access – 0.96% with Coventry BS– One-year fixed – 0.82% with Charter Savings Bank– Two-year fixed – 1% with Cambridge Building Society– Five-year fixed – 1.4% with UBL UK  * NS&I Premium Bonds – Instead of being paid interest, Premium Bond savers purchase bonds worth £1 each, which are entered into a monthly cash prize draw. Prizes vary from £25 to £1million but the odds of winning have recently been dramatically reduced, meaning you also run a high risk of earning nothing.  Experts recommend setting up a standing order for a fixed amount to leave your account on payday and then taking a challenge on top.

183,1375041,"It could happen. Or, you could drive home in your old vehicle, kicking yourself for having forgotten one of the documents you need to complete the purchase. Here’s how to lay the groundwork for getting the deal done on the day you’re ready to buy.  Four steps to prepare to buy a car  Step 1:  You’ll want to talk to your insurance agent about what it will cost to insure the make and model you are considering buying. You don’t want that figure to be a surprise, and you also want to find out how soon you will need to notify your insurer you have the new vehicle.  Step 2:  Talk to your bank or credit union and get preapproved for the loan you’ll need—and do this close to your planned purchase date. You may get something resembling a blank check (up to a certain maximum) that must be signed by you and the dealer. By getting preapproved, you will know the total loan amount and interest rate you qualify for. Even if you plan to finance at the dealer, it can’t hurt to come in with a preapproval; you are far less likely to agree to a longer term or higher interest rate because you really want to drive that new car home today. It can also help you stay within your budget by serving as a solid reminder of how much you planned to spend and how long you were willing to make payments — before the showroom floor made it so hard to remember.  Step 3:  Make sure you have your driver’s license and proof of auto insurance with you. You shouldn’t be driving without these documents anyway.  Step 4:  Obvious as this seems, be sure you have a way of funding your down payment. If it’s not cash, make sure the dealer accepts the form of payment you’re planning to use. (If you forget to do this, you would not be the first, but that would be little consolation.)  Expert Tip: Be cautious about having your credit pulled unnecessarily. Each inquiry made for the purpose of extending credit can cause a small, temporary decrease in your credit score. And while inquiries for the purpose of getting a car loan made in a two-week period should count as only one entry, we’ve heard from consumers who have told us their credit scores dropped as the result of multiple auto loan inquiries. Some dealerships now ask customers to fill out a credit application even before a test drive, and there are reports that some have checked credit without customer consent. It can help to keep an eye on your credit through this process for this reason. Hard inquiries into your credit require permission, and it can be illegal for your credit to be pulled without your approval in this manner.  Can you purchase a car with a credit card?  Speaking of your down payment, you may have wondered if this can be charged to a credit card — or if the entire car can be paid that way. The answer is yes and no. It is possible that the dealership will not accept a credit card payment for the car, as this can come with large merchant fees that lower their profits. However, if your credit is in good standing, then it is still possible.  A better option would be to use your credit card for just the down payment. Not only is this better for your credit, since using all of your available $10,000–$15,000 credit limit can damage your credit score, but it’s more likely to be accepted by the dealer.  Also read: Why buying a 10-year-old car is a savvy move  Finally, you’ll want to use a credit card that has excellent benefits. An appropriate credit card can earn you big rewards on your car purchase or other auto-related purchases.  Planning to trade in your car? don’t forget these items for the dealership  If you plan to trade in a car, you have a bit more to do.  You will need to bring the following items to the dealership:  Your car’s certificate of title (If it has gone missing, your state department of motor vehicles can tell you how to get it replaced.)  The car’s current registration  Your car keys and the owner’s manual  Your account number or a payment stub if you still have a car loan (We’re going to hope that if this is the case, your car is worth more than you owe.)  A clean car, paying special attention to areas out of sight but convenient for stashing things: under seats, over the visors, in the glovebox and in every corner of the trunk  Besides a new car, expect to come home with a good bit of paperwork. Pay special attention to the purchase and sale agreement. You will need the information there to get or update your insurance — and you might even need it at tax time next year if you bought a car that qualifies for a tax credit.  What do I need to apply for an auto loan?  While you won’t need to drive all the way to a dealership to get an auto loan (you can simply apply online), you will still need some important documents in front of you to easily fill out the application.  Here’s what you need:  Proof of identity through an ID or passport  Your credit report, which the lender can pull using your name, address, date of birth and social security number  A valid state-issued driver’s license  Proof of monthly income through pay stubs or social security income receipts  Proof of residence through mortgage statements or utility bills  Contact information for personal references (note: this may not be required)  Vehicle make and model  Proof of car insurance  Payment type (cash, credit, debit, etc.)  Your car’s registration if you are trading in the vehicle  The list is rather long, but having each document will speed up the process and prevent you from going back and forth between your files.  See: Do this before buying a car, it could save you a bundle  Make sure that you can qualify for an auto loan by checking your free credit score. From there, you can apply for your auto loan with confidence and compare credit cards that can help you finance your new car.  Frequently asked questions  Will my credit rating affect my auto insurance rates?  You should choose auto insurance coverage based on your credit rating and overall coverage needs.  How can I find a credit card with a low interest rate to charge my car purchase?  We don’t recommend that you put your entire purchase onto your credit card, but there are cards with low APR or no APR for up to 15 months available to compare. If you can pay off the remaining balance during this period, then these credit cards may be for you.  How good should my credit be to get a credit card that is appropriate for a car purchase?  Many of the best rewards credit cards with high credit limits require good or excellent credit. A good credit score is considered 700–749 and anything over 750 is considered excellent.  You mentioned that hard inquiries can affect my credit score. What is a hard inquiry?  A hard inquiry is a credit check that indicates you have applied for credit, usually through a loan. Each time a hard inquiry is pulled from a different lender, your credit score can drop by up to 10 points, because it indicates that a lender has reviewed your credit and that you are trying to open up a new line of credit.

Step 3:  Make sure you have your driver’s license and proof of auto insurance with you. You shouldn’t be driving without these documents anyway.  Step 4:  Obvious as this seems, be sure you have a way of funding your down payment. If it’s not cash, make sure the dealer accepts the form of payment you’re planning to use. (If you forget to do this, you would not be the first, but that would be little consolation.)  Expert Tip: Be cautious about having your credit pulled unnecessarily. Each inquiry made for the purpose of extending credit can cause a small, temporary decrease in your credit score. And while inquiries for the purpose of getting a car loan made in a two-week period should count as only one entry, we’ve heard from consumers who have told us their credit scores dropped as the result of multiple auto loan inquiries. Some dealerships now ask customers to fill out a credit application even before a test drive, and there are reports that some have checked credit without customer consent. It can help to keep an eye on your credit through this process for this reason. Hard inquiries into your credit require permission, and it can be illegal for your credit to be pulled without your approval in this manner.  Can you purchase a car with a credit card?  Speaking of your down payment, you may have wondered if this can be charged to a credit card — or if the entire car can be paid that way. The answer is yes and no. It is possible that the dealership will not accept a credit card payment for the car, as this can come with large merchant fees that lower their profits. However, if your credit is in good standing, then it is still possible.  A better option would be to use your credit card for just the down payment. Not only is this better for your credit, since using all of your available $10,000–$15,000 credit limit can damage your credit score, but it’s more likely to be accepted by the dealer.  Also read: Why buying a 10-year-old car is a savvy move  Finally, you’ll want to use a credit card that has excellent benefits. An appropriate credit card can earn you big rewards on your car purchase or other auto-related purchases.  Planning to trade in your car? don’t forget these items for the dealership  If you plan to trade in a car, you have a bit more to do.  You will need to bring the following items to the dealership:  Your car’s certificate of title (If it has gone missing, your state department of motor vehicles can tell you how to get it replaced.)  The car’s current registration  Your car keys and the owner’s manual  Your account number or a payment stub if you still have a car loan (We’re going to hope that if this is the case, your car is worth more than you owe.)  A clean car, paying special attention to areas out of sight but convenient for stashing things: under seats, over the visors, in the glovebox and in every corner of the trunk  Besides a new car, expect to come home with a good bit of paperwork. Pay special attention to the purchase and sale agreement. You will need the information there to get or update your insurance — and you might even need it at tax time next year if you bought a car that qualifies for a tax credit.  What do I need to apply for an auto loan?  While you won’t need to drive all the way to a dealership to get an auto loan (you can simply apply online), you will still need some important documents in front of you to easily fill out the application.  Here’s what you need:  Proof of identity through an ID or passport  Your credit report, which the lender can pull using your name, address, date of birth and social security number  A valid state-issued driver’s license  Proof of monthly income through pay stubs or social security income receipts  Proof of residence through mortgage statements or utility bills  Contact information for personal references (note: this may not be required)  Vehicle make and model  Proof of car insurance  Payment type (cash, credit, debit, etc.)  Your car’s registration if you are trading in the vehicle  The list is rather long, but having each document will speed up the process and prevent you from going back and forth between your files.  See: Do this before buying a car, it could save you a bundle  Make sure that you can qualify for an auto loan by checking your free credit score. From there, you can apply for your auto loan with confidence and compare credit cards that can help you finance your new car.  Frequently asked questions  Will my credit rating affect my auto insurance rates?  You should choose auto insurance coverage based on your credit rating and overall coverage needs.  How can I find a credit card with a low interest rate to charge my car purchase?  We don’t recommend that you put your entire purchase onto your credit card, but there are cards with low APR or no APR for up to 15 months available to compare. If you can pay off the remaining balance during this period, then these credit cards may be for you.  How good should my credit be to get a credit card that is appropriate for a car purchase?  Many of the best rewards credit cards with high credit limits require good or excellent credit. A good credit score is considered 700–749 and anything over 750 is considered excellent.  You mentioned that hard inquiries can affect my credit score. What is a hard inquiry?  A hard inquiry is a credit check that indicates you have applied for credit, usually through a loan. Each time a hard inquiry is pulled from a different lender, your credit score can drop by up to 10 points, because it indicates that a lender has reviewed your credit and that you are trying to open up a new line of credit.

Central & South West Corp.'s Southwestern Electric Power Co. unit
filed an appeal in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals of a
district-court ruling that disqualified its bid for the bankrupt Cajun
Electric Power Cooperative. Southwestern Electric, Shreveport, La., said
the ruling reversed a Bankruptcy Court finding that allowed the company
to help a group of cooperatives supporting the plan with $1 million in
legal fees and expenses in connection with the proposed acquisition. The
cooperatives returned the fees and, along with Southwestern Electric,
have filed for expedited consideration of the appeal. A district court
in June threw out Southwestern's $940 million bid for Cajun Electric's

185,1219804,"It comes as Department for Education (DfE) analysis suggests that on more than one in 10 of all courses there is a 75% chance graduates will not be earning enough five years after leaving university to start repaying student loans.  According to the official graduate outcomes for 2015 to 2016 data, the percentage of courses where the repayment threshold is not met after five years varies from subject to subject.  Graduates must start repaying their loans when they earn £25,000 or over - a threshold that was raised by the Government in April 2018.  Mr Hinds is urging prospective students to use all the data available to them to make sure they are choosing a course and institution that is right for them.  The DfE analysis identified around 20 providers where at least three quarters of all students are still not earning enough to start repaying their loans five years after graduation.  Mr Hinds believes the figures should be a wake-up call for universities about their responsibility to deliver the best outcome for students.  He said: ""The opportunity to study at university should be open to anyone with the talent and potential to benefit from higher education.  ""With students and taxpayers sharing the cost of higher education it's right that we challenge those institutions which could appear to be more focused on 'getting bums on seats' than getting students into high quality courses worth paying for.  ""That's why I want universities to be brave and ask themselves if they're running courses that really help students gain the skills they need for the workforce of tomorrow - if they're not they should improve them or end them.  ""But if universities think other options like apprenticeships or technical education are a better fit for a student, they should give young people that advice rather than put them on a course that isn't providing what they need for a bright future.""  The DfE says around 45% of the value of outstanding post-2012 student loans are not expected to be repaid, coming at a significant cost to the taxpayer.  Mr Hinds said it is not right that institutions benefit from student loan funded fee income for delivering poor value courses, as students and taxpayers are the ones that suffer.","Thousands of students are being let down by universities providing poor value degrees, the Education Secretary has warned.

191,1118648,"SEE ALSO: Retirees, Avoid These 11 Costly Medicare Mistakes  The standard monthly premium for Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, jumps nearly 7% for 2020, to $144.60. New Medicare enrollees, those who don't get Social Security benefits and those who are directly billed for Part B premiums are automatically subject to the standard premium.  Other Medicare beneficiaries may not get the full wallop of that premium increase. Given the 1.6% cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits in 2020, some Medicare beneficiaries will be protected by the ""hold harmless"" provision. That provision keeps many beneficiaries' Part B premium increase from exceeding the increase in their Social Security benefits if premiums are automatically deducted from benefits.  But about 7% of beneficiaries will pay more than the standard premium: High-income beneficiaries don't benefit from the hold-harmless provision and instead pay a monthly income-related adjustment on top of the standard Part B premium. These beneficiaries also pay a surcharge on their Part D prescription-drug plan premiums.  The good news for some high-income beneficiaries: For the first time since 2011, the income thresholds determining the 2020 surcharges are adjusted for inflation. Surcharges don't start to kick in until single taxpayers have more than $87,000 of modified adjusted gross income (AGI plus tax-exempt interest), which is $2,000 more than the threshold that applied for the past 10 years, or until married taxpayers filing jointly have more than $174,000 of MAGI, $4,000 more than in recent years. There's one exception to the inflation adjustments: The top fifth tier, which was new for 2019, remains the same and applies to singles with MAGI of $500,000 or more and joint filers with MAGI of $750,000 or more.  The not-so-good news? The total Part B premium for those subject to surcharges is climbing by nearly 7% across all the tiers. The first tier's total premium, for instance, rises from $189.60 in 2019 to $202.40 for 2020.  SEE ALSO: 7 Things Medicare Doesn't Cover  Part D surcharges, however, are dropping slightly. For example, those in the first tier will pay $12.20 on top of their plan premium in 2020, which is 20 cents less than 2019. Those in the fourth tier will pay an extra $70, a 90-cent drop from 2019.  Of course, the biggest savings will go to those who fall into a lower tier because of the inflation adjustments. For instance, let's say your MAGI is $135,000 as a single. In 2019, you are in the third tier paying a Part D surcharge of $51.40, whereas in 2020, you fall into the second tier and owe a Part D surcharge of $31.50--a savings of nearly 39%. The total Part B premium would fall about 18% with that same switch in tiers, to $289.20 in 2020.  Check Eligibility for Surcharge Waiver  Medicare premium surcharges are based on information from your tax return two years prior. If your circumstances have changed since you filed that return, you might qualify for a surcharge waiver.  The federal government provides relief as a result of certain life-changing events, such as death of a spouse or retirement, which can qualify you to use your current, lower income and avoid the surcharge.

High-income retirees will experience the biggest changes.

Medicare beneficiaries, expect to pay more for coverage next year. The Medicare Part B premium is rising, and high-income retirees will see a spike in income-related charges for 2020. But for the first time in a decade, inflation adjustments have changed the income thresholds for those charges, mitigating the pain for some high-income beneficiaries.
SEE ALSO: Retirees, Avoid These 11 Costly Medicare Mistakes  The standard monthly premium for Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, jumps nearly 7% for 2020, to $144.60. New Medicare enrollees, those who don't get Social Security benefits and those who are directly billed for Part B premiums are automatically subject to the standard premium.  Other Medicare beneficiaries may not get the full wallop of that premium increase. Given the 1.6% cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits in 2020, some Medicare beneficiaries will be protected by the ""hold harmless"" provision. That provision keeps many beneficiaries' Part B premium increase from exceeding the increase in their Social Security benefits if premiums are automatically deducted from benefits.  But about 7% of beneficiaries will pay more than the standard premium: High-income beneficiaries don't benefit from the hold-harmless provision and instead pay a monthly income-related adjustment on top of the standard Part B premium. These beneficiaries also pay a surcharge on their Part D prescription-drug plan premiums.  The good news for some high-income beneficiaries: For the first time since 2011, the income thresholds determining the 2020 surcharges are adjusted for inflation. Surcharges don't start to kick in until single taxpayers have more than $87,000 of modified adjusted gross income (AGI plus tax-exempt interest), which is $2,000 more than the threshold that applied for the past 10 years, or until married taxpayers filing jointly have more than $174,000 of MAGI, $4,000 more than in recent years. There's one exception to the inflation adjustments: The top fifth tier, which was new for 2019, remains the same and applies to singles with MAGI of $500,000 or more and joint filers with MAGI of $750,000 or more.  The not-so-good news? The total Part B premium for those subject to surcharges is climbing by nearly 7% across all the tiers. The first tier's total premium, for instance, rises from $189.60 in 2019 to $202.40 for 2020.  SEE ALSO: 7 Things Medicare Doesn't Cover  Part D surcharges, however, are dropping slightly. For example, those in the first tier will pay $12.20 on top of their plan premium in 2020, which is 20 cents less than 2019. Those in the fourth tier will pay an extra $70, a 90-cent drop from 2019.  Of course, the biggest savings will go to those who fall into a lower tier because of the inflation adjustments. For instance, let's say your MAGI is $135,000 as a single. In 2019, you are in the third tier paying a Part D surcharge of $51.40, whereas in 2020, you fall into the second tier and owe a Part D surcharge of $31.50--a savings of nearly 39%. The total Part B premium would fall about 18% with that same switch in tiers, to $289.20 in 2020.  Check Eligibility for Surcharge Waiver  Medicare premium surcharges are based on information from your tax return two years prior. If your circumstances have changed since you filed that return, you might qualify for a surcharge waiver.  The federal government provides relief as a result of certain life-changing events, such as death of a spouse or retirement, which can qualify you to use your current, lower income and avoid the surcharge. You can learn more at www.socialsecurity.gov.  If you experienced one of those events since your 2018 tax return was filed, you can file Form SSA-44 with the Social Security Administration and provide the appropriate documentation, such as a letter from your former employer noting your retirement.  If you had a one-time spike in income, such as a large profit from the sale of a house, you're out of luck on escaping the surcharges.

193,83850,"Buyer power is moderate overall as is the ability of new players in entering the market place with supplier power remaining strong. Despite savings and investments being among the alternative methods of insuring one’s self, substitutes possess a weak force in the market, due to the expertise and capital required for investment.  The demand for life insurance is determined by various factors: i.e. gross domestic product, average length of life expectancy, inflation and interest rates. Additionally, in developing countries, factors such as market structure, the presence of foreign investors and financial development of economies should be taken into consideration. There are also various reasons for getting a life insurance policy. Such a policy guarantees a replacement income for one’s dependents in case of death or major illness. Some types of life insurance create a cash value that, if not paid out as a death benefit, can be borrowed or withdrawn on the owner’s request, which makes it an important element of sound financial planning and investment.  Since most people consider paying their life insurance policy premiums a high priority, buying a cash-value type policy can create a kind of “forced” savings plan. Various companies can also use group life insurance to cover their employees or corporate-owned life insurance (COLI). COLI was originally purchased by companies to hedge against the financial cost of losing key employees to unexpected death, the risk of recruiting and training replacements of necessary or highly-trained personnel, or to fund corporate obligations to redeem stock upon the death of an owner.  A point to consider in the current economic climate is the drop in real income during 2009. Followed by slow growth in 2010 this may limit the demand for insurance products, which are unlikely to be considered a priority by households at present.  Due to the nature of the market and importance of the product offered, there are many individual consumers, diminishing buyer power, as the impact of losing an individual customer is rather marginal. Large corporate clients have a lot more bargaining power with insurance companies as they usually pay millions of dollars a year in premiums and losing such high-margin corporate clients can negatively affect a player's revenues. This increases buyer power to some extent. Customers in this market are not particularly loyal to one specific company and are willing to shop round for the best deal. Online comparison sites allow customers to choose policies that meet their individual insurance needs, further boosting buyer power.  However buyer power is weakened by the existence of switching costs, as for individuals, switching from one player to another will often involve surrendering a policy early (an exception is where a term policy reaches its end and the buyer chooses a different company for their next policy). The payout on a surrendered policy may be taxable, whereas the payout on the death of the insured person is tax-free; also early surrender of an index-linked plan may mean that the policyholder misses out on some interest payments. Buyer power is assessed as moderate overall.  Suppliers in the life insurance market include ICT manufacturers and software houses. Certain insurance companies require specialized computer systems, tailored towards their unique range of products or services. Underwriters, for instance, use computer applications known as ""smart systems"" to manage risks. These types of systems are complex and are often linked up to an internet databases. A secure and reliable ICT infrastructure is essential and companies are often reliant on one supplier. This is normally a large and reputable company, such as IBM. Such suppliers may have their own unique and patented systems. This creates a disincentive for insurance companies to switch suppliers as many employers are reluctant to spend the money training staff on new systems, which increases supplier power. Despite many insurance companies maintaining their own IT departments, there is little likelihood of significant backward integration, which further strengthens suppliers (although it is equally unlikely that suppliers would attempt to integrate forwards into insurance services). Life insurers also require the services of reinsurance companies, in order to reduce their own exposure to insured risks. Overall supplier power is strong in the life insurance market.  During much of Communist era, the only insurer operating in Hungary was Állami Biztosító Rt (ÁB Rt), (State Insurance Company). In 1986, as the government began the initial move toward full economic transition, ÁB Rt was split into two, to encourage competition, and following the change of political system both were officially registered in 1990 as the public companies ÁB Rt and Hungária Biztosító Rt. In 1992, the transition to a privately-owned insurance system was completed with the sale of ÁB to Dutch giant Aegon and Hungária to German insurer Allianz, opening the market for foreign competition.  Barriers to entry into life insurance market are often described as low; however new players entering the market must decide whether to initially enter on a large or small scale, with each holding varying benefits and risks. The opportunity to enter the market on a small scale boosts the threat of new entrants. Entry into the market for well developed insurance companies is capital intensive and players need to ensure some level of integration if market entry is to be a success. Leading incumbents have strong reputations and consumer recognition and they usually offer a vast range of services with which new entrants must compete. Most of the threat from new entrants lies within the insurance industry itself. Repeat business is difficult to attain in this market, since consumers will typically replace their life insurance policies at infrequent intervals only. This means that finding new custom is vital, and access to distribution networks is a key criterion for successful market entry. Some companies have carved out niche areas in which they underwrite insurance. These insurance companies are fearful of being squeezed out by the bigger players. Another threat for many insurance companies is other financial services companies entering the market. Indeed some banks and investment banks have started to offer insurance products, while certain financial commitments, such as mortgages, have life policies attached to them. In some countries however, regulations are in place to prevent banks and other financial firms from entering the market. Government regulation is generally stringent, with the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA) - Pénzügyi Szervezetek Állami Felügyelete (PSZÁF) - responsible for overseeing companies in this market and other financial institutions, thus limiting market entries by imposing capital adequacy and other requirements on players. The likelihood of new entrants is assessed as moderate.  There are a number of alternatives to taking out an insurance policy, i.e. in form of other financial products, such as savings and investments. Savings and investments include deposits, mutual funds and direct investments in equities and bonds. Wills are also a way of accounting for risk and protecting family members after death. These options could be a cheaper alternative to life insurance, but savings do not guarantee protection in the same way as life insurance, which reduces the benefit of this option. Consumers can adopt risk management strategies, such as 'Self-Insurance', whereby an eligible risk is retained, but a calculated amount of money is set aside. An organization could choose to operate its own 'captive' structure and form its own insurance company subsidiary. Although these are viable substitutes they require a certain amount of expertise and capital. The threat of substitutes with respect to the non-life insurance market is therefore assessed as weak.  There is now a unified insurance market in the European Union, as a result of the EU's Insurance Mediation Directive. This acts as a single ""passport"" for entities selling insurance within the EU. The life insurance market is fairly fragmented, with several smaller companies in business alongside the majors. Players within the life insurance market offer similar services but some are diversified, and pursue a number of non-life insurance lines, which tends to ease rivalry to some extent. The leading players are large companies offering similar life products, although there are a number of different plans including temporary, permanent and various subclasses. Because of the homogenous nature of the leading players insurance has become more like a commodity - an area in which an insurance company with a low cost structure, greater efficiency and better customer service will beat out competitors. Entry barriers, though not insignificant, are lower than exit barriers. For example, the regulatory system, through the imposition of such measures as capital adequacy, is designed to prevent insurers from going out of business, as this would be to the detriment of policyholders. When exit barriers in a market are high, players may weather poor market conditions where necessary - but this tends to boost rivalry. Insurance companies also use higher investment returns and a variety of insurance investment products to try to lure in customers. This leads to greater consolidation within the market. Larger companies prefer to take over or merge with other companies rather than spend the money to market and advertise to people. Overall, there is moderate rivalry in the market.

The life insurance market will be analyzed taking insurance companies as players. The key buyers will be taken as consumers (both individual as well as corporate), and ICT manufacturers, software houses and reinsurance companies as the key suppliers.

The Hungarian life insurance market recovered this year from a recent contraction in value; however, despite the increase in growth the degree of rivalry is measured as strong.
Buyer power is moderate overall as is the ability of new players in entering the market place with supplier power remaining strong. Despite savings and investments being among the alternative methods of insuring one’s self, substitutes possess a weak force in the market, due to the expertise and capital required for investment.  The demand for life insurance is determined by various factors: i.e. gross domestic product, average length of life expectancy, inflation and interest rates. Additionally, in developing countries, factors such as market structure, the presence of foreign investors and financial development of economies should be taken into consideration. There are also various reasons for getting a life insurance policy. Such a policy guarantees a replacement income for one’s dependents in case of death or major illness. Some types of life insurance create a cash value that, if not paid out as a death benefit, can be borrowed or withdrawn on the owner’s request, which makes it an important element of sound financial planning and investment.  Since most people consider paying their life insurance policy premiums a high priority, buying a cash-value type policy can create a kind of “forced” savings plan. Various companies can also use group life insurance to cover their employees or corporate-owned life insurance (COLI). COLI was originally purchased by companies to hedge against the financial cost of losing key employees to unexpected death, the risk of recruiting and training replacements of necessary or highly-trained personnel, or to fund corporate obligations to redeem stock upon the death of an owner.  A point to consider in the current economic climate is the drop in real income during 2009. Followed by slow growth in 2010 this may limit the demand for insurance products, which are unlikely to be considered a priority by households at present.  Due to the nature of the market and importance of the product offered, there are many individual consumers, diminishing buyer power, as the impact of losing an individual customer is rather marginal. Large corporate clients have a lot more bargaining power with insurance companies as they usually pay millions of dollars a year in premiums and losing such high-margin corporate clients can negatively affect a player's revenues. This increases buyer power to some extent. Customers in this market are not particularly loyal to one specific company and are willing to shop round for the best deal. Online comparison sites allow customers to choose policies that meet their individual insurance needs, further boosting buyer power.  However buyer power is weakened by the existence of switching costs, as for individuals, switching from one player to another will often involve surrendering a policy early (an exception is where a term policy reaches its end and the buyer chooses a different company for their next policy). The payout on a surrendered policy may be taxable, whereas the payout on the death of the insured person is tax-free; also early surrender of an index-linked plan may mean that the policyholder misses out on some interest payments. Buyer power is assessed as moderate overall.  Suppliers in the life insurance market include ICT manufacturers and software houses. Certain insurance companies require specialized computer systems, tailored towards their unique range of products or services. Underwriters, for instance, use computer applications known as ""smart systems"" to manage risks. These types of systems are complex and are often linked up to an internet databases. A secure and reliable ICT infrastructure is essential and companies are often reliant on one supplier. This is normally a large and reputable company, such as IBM. Such suppliers may have their own unique and patented systems. This creates a disincentive for insurance companies to switch suppliers as many employers are reluctant to spend the money training staff on new systems, which increases supplier power. Despite many insurance companies maintaining their own IT departments, there is little likelihood of significant backward integration, which further strengthens suppliers (although it is equally unlikely that suppliers would attempt to integrate forwards into insurance services). Life insurers also require the services of reinsurance companies, in order to reduce their own exposure to insured risks. Overall supplier power is strong in the life insurance market.  During much of Communist era, the only insurer operating in Hungary was Állami Biztosító Rt (ÁB Rt), (State Insurance Company). In 1986, as the government began the initial move toward full economic transition, ÁB Rt was split into two, to encourage competition, and following the change of political system both were officially registered in 1990 as the public companies ÁB Rt and Hungária Biztosító Rt. In 1992, the transition to a privately-owned insurance system was completed with the sale of ÁB to Dutch giant Aegon and Hungária to German insurer Allianz, opening the market for foreign competition.  Barriers to entry into life insurance market are often described as low; however new players entering the market must decide whether to initially enter on a large or small scale, with each holding varying benefits and risks. The opportunity to enter the market on a small scale boosts the threat of new entrants. Entry into the market for well developed insurance companies is capital intensive and players need to ensure some level of integration if market entry is to be a success. Leading incumbents have strong reputations and consumer recognition and they usually offer a vast range of services with which new entrants must compete. Most of the threat from new entrants lies within the insurance industry itself. Repeat business is difficult to attain in this market, since consumers will typically replace their life insurance policies at infrequent intervals only. This means that finding new custom is vital, and access to distribution networks is a key criterion for successful market entry. Some companies have carved out niche areas in which they underwrite insurance. These insurance companies are fearful of being squeezed out by the bigger players. Another threat for many insurance companies is other financial services companies entering the market. Indeed some banks and investment banks have started to offer insurance products, while certain financial commitments, such as mortgages, have life policies attached to them. In some countries however, regulations are in place to prevent banks and other financial firms from entering the market. Government regulation is generally stringent, with the Hungarian Financial Supervisory Authority (HFSA) - Pénzügyi Szervezetek Állami Felügyelete (PSZÁF) - responsible for overseeing companies in this market and other financial institutions, thus limiting market entries by imposing capital adequacy and other requirements on players. The likelihood of new entrants is assessed as moderate.  There are a number of alternatives to taking out an insurance policy, i.e. in form of other financial products, such as savings and investments. Savings and investments include deposits, mutual funds and direct investments in equities and bonds. Wills are also a way of accounting for risk and protecting family members after death. These options could be a cheaper alternative to life insurance, but savings do not guarantee protection in the same way as life insurance, which reduces the benefit of this option. Consumers can adopt risk management strategies, such as 'Self-Insurance', whereby an eligible risk is retained, but a calculated amount of money is set aside. An organization could choose to operate its own 'captive' structure and form its own insurance company subsidiary. Although these are viable substitutes they require a certain amount of expertise and capital. The threat of substitutes with respect to the non-life insurance market is therefore assessed as weak.  There is now a unified insurance market in the European Union, as a result of the EU's Insurance Mediation Directive. This acts as a single ""passport"" for entities selling insurance within the EU. The life insurance market is fairly fragmented, with several smaller companies in business alongside the majors. Players within the life insurance market offer similar services but some are diversified, and pursue a number of non-life insurance lines, which tends to ease rivalry to some extent. The leading players are large companies offering similar life products, although there are a number of different plans including temporary, permanent and various subclasses. Because of the homogenous nature of the leading players insurance has become more like a commodity - an area in which an insurance company with a low cost structure, greater efficiency and better customer service will beat out competitors. Entry barriers, though not insignificant, are lower than exit barriers. For example, the regulatory system, through the imposition of such measures as capital adequacy, is designed to prevent insurers from going out of business, as this would be to the detriment of policyholders. When exit barriers in a market are high, players may weather poor market conditions where necessary - but this tends to boost rivalry. Insurance companies also use higher investment returns and a variety of insurance investment products to try to lure in customers. This leads to greater consolidation within the market. Larger companies prefer to take over or merge with other companies rather than spend the money to market and advertise to people. Overall, there is moderate rivalry in the market.  This section contains brief overviews of the leading companies in the Hungarian life insurance market.

195,1222280,"Consider that a Roth IRA can be a source of recurring tax-free income (without the need for nettlesome required minimum distributions) or could serve as a safety net when you need some extra funds.  A Roth can also be part of your tax-free legacy to your heirs, since the distributions that they take from the account are not taxable, and the monies in the Roth continue to enjoy tax-free growth.  The tax free growth does not last forever though, since a Roth beneficiary must begin taking RMDs by Dec. 31 of the year after the owner's death.  When an owner withdraws income from a Roth IRA, the distributions are not considered as part of gross income, thus not raising taxable income; and when one's income is lower, good things happen tax-wise:  You do not have to pay a 3.8 percent tax on investment income.  In some cases, there will be less tax on your Social Security benefits.  You may pay lower Medicare premiums.  You may be eligible for larger medical expense deduction.  You will not be subjected to a loss of itemized deductions or personal exemptions.  So then why doesn't every taxpayer convert his or her traditional IRA to a Roth?  Simple - the entire amount of the conversion is included in your taxable income for that year. There are also some potential downsides to a Roth conversion:  The government could enact legislation to change the tax code and make Roth IRA's less favorable. That was the case during the Obama administration when then-President Obama kicked up some dust by suggesting Roth distributions should be taxable.  Your tax rate in retirement could go down instead of up and that would mean that a conversion at today's higher rates would be a bad bargain.  The Roth's investments could go down in value instead of up (meaning you paid tax on value you didn't get).  You might someday need the cash that you pay to the IRS to pay for the conversion.  Rather than attempting to eat the entire elephant in one fell swoop, it may pay to consider converting to a Roth in increments, rather than all at once.  For example, if your taxable income is low in a given year, it could be advantageous to simply convert enough of your taxable IRA so that the additional income you will have to include would not thrust you into a higher tax bracket.  As an example, if a married retired couple had a taxable income of $65,000 of taxable income for 2020, they would be in the 12% marginal tax bracket.  Since the 12% bracket phases out at $80,250 this year, they could convert $15,250 from their traditional IRA to a Roth in 2020 without propelling themselves into the 22% tax bracket.  This technique would be particularly appealing if the couples' future RMDs will place them in a higher bracket down the road. Taking this incremental approach this year could lower those future RMDs enough to avoid a higher bracket later.  If your spouse is in failing health, remember that when one spouse dies, the survivor often finds him or herself in a much higher single filer income tax bracket even though the income of the surviving partner hasn't increased.  It may make sense for married couple to consider this possibility and do a Roth conversion before a death occurs.  Another effective incremental strategy is to convert shares of stock that are currently undervalued but are likely to go up in the future.  Assume that you have Google stock that is currently worth $25,000, but you believe that the stock will double in the next two or three years.

It has become abundantly clear that a Roth IRA is, in many ways, superior to a traditional IRA.

Once you get past the lack of deductibility of contributions to a Roth, the other tax benefits of a Roth are inescapable.
Consider that a Roth IRA can be a source of recurring tax-free income (without the need for nettlesome required minimum distributions) or could serve as a safety net when you need some extra funds.  A Roth can also be part of your tax-free legacy to your heirs, since the distributions that they take from the account are not taxable, and the monies in the Roth continue to enjoy tax-free growth.  The tax free growth does not last forever though, since a Roth beneficiary must begin taking RMDs by Dec. 31 of the year after the owner's death.  When an owner withdraws income from a Roth IRA, the distributions are not considered as part of gross income, thus not raising taxable income; and when one's income is lower, good things happen tax-wise:  You do not have to pay a 3.8 percent tax on investment income.  In some cases, there will be less tax on your Social Security benefits.  You may pay lower Medicare premiums.  You may be eligible for larger medical expense deduction.  You will not be subjected to a loss of itemized deductions or personal exemptions.  So then why doesn't every taxpayer convert his or her traditional IRA to a Roth?  Simple - the entire amount of the conversion is included in your taxable income for that year. There are also some potential downsides to a Roth conversion:  The government could enact legislation to change the tax code and make Roth IRA's less favorable. That was the case during the Obama administration when then-President Obama kicked up some dust by suggesting Roth distributions should be taxable.  Your tax rate in retirement could go down instead of up and that would mean that a conversion at today's higher rates would be a bad bargain.  The Roth's investments could go down in value instead of up (meaning you paid tax on value you didn't get).  You might someday need the cash that you pay to the IRS to pay for the conversion.  Rather than attempting to eat the entire elephant in one fell swoop, it may pay to consider converting to a Roth in increments, rather than all at once.  For example, if your taxable income is low in a given year, it could be advantageous to simply convert enough of your taxable IRA so that the additional income you will have to include would not thrust you into a higher tax bracket.  As an example, if a married retired couple had a taxable income of $65,000 of taxable income for 2020, they would be in the 12% marginal tax bracket.  Since the 12% bracket phases out at $80,250 this year, they could convert $15,250 from their traditional IRA to a Roth in 2020 without propelling themselves into the 22% tax bracket.  This technique would be particularly appealing if the couples' future RMDs will place them in a higher bracket down the road. Taking this incremental approach this year could lower those future RMDs enough to avoid a higher bracket later.  If your spouse is in failing health, remember that when one spouse dies, the survivor often finds him or herself in a much higher single filer income tax bracket even though the income of the surviving partner hasn't increased.  It may make sense for married couple to consider this possibility and do a Roth conversion before a death occurs.  Another effective incremental strategy is to convert shares of stock that are currently undervalued but are likely to go up in the future.  Assume that you have Google stock that is currently worth $25,000, but you believe that the stock will double in the next two or three years.  The strategy would be to move the actual stock from the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, thus paying income tax today on the lower price.  The future expected appreciation in the stock will escape taxation in the Roth. And yes, you may convert specific assets in a traditional IRA to a Roth."

200,846206,"Love & Money is a MarketWatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.  Like 40% of students who enter college, life got in the way of Shawnte’ Cain completing her degree.  Cain, 39, began her college career in 1997 at Wayne State University in Detroit. She successfully made it through three years at the school, but just as she could see her degree on the horizon, her grandmother fell ill. School fell by the wayside as Cain cared for her and her own financial obligations rose.  For years, Cain, who works as a casino host at the MGM Grand Detroit, toyed with returning to college, but work and family obligations kept getting in the way. “I was finding barriers to stop me from finishing,” she said recently.  But in 2018, Cain finally re-enrolled at Wayne State thanks in part to a new program at the school called Warrior Way Back, which forgives up to $1,500 in debt former students owed to the school if they return. Of course, coming back to campus after 20 years away wasn’t simple.  Cain enlisted the support of her family to make sure someone would be available to watch her 5-year-old son while she was in school and at work. She found trusted advisors at the school who helped her navigate course work, locate the parking lot closest to her classes and get set up with networking and study groups.  Don’t miss: This Class of 2018 graduate is 66 and one of many older Americans pursuing a degree  And in December of last year, she finally got that degree — fulfilling a promise to her late fiance that she would complete her education — and she’s still on campus taking a few courses to enhance it. “It feels amazing,” she said of graduating. “A lot of boundaries that were placed between myself and my dream job have been lifted.”  Cain may not fit with the image we often conjure when we think of college students — the co-ed lounging in the quad and grabbing a few beers with friends. But these days, the typical student looks more like Cain. Nearly 40% of undergraduates are older than 25 and nearly one-quarter are raising children, according to Lumina Foundation, an organization focused on increasing access to post-high school education.  More “non-traditional” or independent college students attend college than a generation ago, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “It is important for promoting racial and ethnic equity in college attainment, given the relatively large share of students of color among independent students,” it said in a 2018 report.  There are likely millions more adults out there looking to start college for the first time or go back after years away.  Here are some tips to make that happen:  Choose a school that suits your needs  Working adults with family and other responsibilities have different needs than other students. They should look for schools that can accommodate those priorities, said Rebecca Klein-Collins, author of “Never Too Late:The Adult Student’s Guide to College.”  “Find a college that really understands who you are at this stage in your life and doesn’t make you try to apologize for who you are at this stage in your life,” she said.  Schools that are particularly supportive of adult learners often offer courses outside of normal work hours and have rolling admissions and rolling start dates, Klein-Collins said. They’ll also give students some credit for skills they’ve learned on the job.  Washington Monthly’s ranking of the best colleges for adult learners can be a good place to begin a search for schools that fit this bill.  Another good resource for potential students: The people doing the job they’re hoping to get after graduation, said Matthew Reed, the vice president for learning at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, N.J. He suggests students talk with people a few steps ahead in their career journey and ask them what credential they got and where they earned it. It’s not a question to ask schools.  “No college will say, ‘We’re not very good at X,’” he said. “So skip that entirely.”  Adult students need to be discerning when choosing a school. For-profit colleges often do a great job of catering to students with complicated schedules — and make a point of highlighting that flexibility in their marketing materials — but their outcomes are often poor and come at a high cost.  “Generally speaking when in doubt go public, either community college or a local state university,” Reed said. “Most of the time you’re going to get a better deal.”  Prepare before you go  If you’ve been to college before, Reed suggests pulling together your transcripts and bringing them to any meetings with representatives with the colleges you’re considering. That way, you can get as much credit as possible for work you’ve already done.  Reed also advises students to ask about prior learning assessments, which essentially allow a college to evaluate whether they can give you credit for skills you can prove you learned on the job. “Someone who as worked as an office manager may not need to take the intro to business class,” he said.  Adults who haven’t been in school for several years may also need to brush up on their academic and other skills.  Before Tanganyika Washington returned to Wayne State at age 39 to pursue a teaching degree focused on middle and high school math, she went to online education sites like Khan Academy to brush up on her calculus and trigonometry skills.  “It had been more than 10 years since I had cracked open a textbook and did math on the college level,” said Washington, who studied engineering when she attended Wayne State for the first time in the late 1990s.  Adult students who aren’t tech savvy may want to brush up on their computer skills, given that so much of college these days, including turning in assignments, is conducted online. When Wayne State began bringing students back to campus as part of the Warrior Way Back program, administrators realized they needed to offer an orientation that specifically brought adult students “up to speed for skills that we expect students who are 18 to have, no problem,” said Dawn Medley, the vice president for enrollment management at the school.  Navigating the money piece  Paying for college can be challenging at any age, but for adult students who are likely entirely responsible for the cost — and may have other financial responsibilities — successfully navigating the economics of earning a degree can be particularly important.  Adult students who are working should explore whether their employer can help them pay for school, Reed said. About 90% of midsize or large employers offer some kind of tuition reimbursement. Even when that’s not available, some employers may have an arrangement with certain schools that provide discounts to their workers, Reed said.  “The best case is when the employer pays for it,” Reed said.  Still, it’s likely students will also have to explore some other source of financing. To get access to government grants and loans, they should fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (or FAFSA). But students should be wary of any website trying to charge students to fill out their FAFSA, Reed said. “Do not pay for the FAFSA,” he said. “If they charge you for it, they’re scamming you.”  Students returning to college may also have to work through financial challenges precipitated by leaving school. It’s not uncommon for students who leave college unexpectedly to owe a balance to their school — a sum the college may require back before they’ll allow the student to return or release their transcript to another school.  Wayne State’s Warrior Way Back program aims to help mitigate this problem, but it’s a rare approach, said Sherri Gonzales Warren, the vice president of the Civic Council of Greater Kansas, who has worked with students returning to school for years as part of a strategy to boost her region’s economic viability.  Students who find themselves owing a balance should call up the school and ask if it has a fund for students facing financial emergencies that could be tapped to pay off the debt, Gonzales Warren said. They could also look elsewhere for resources such as a community-based scholarship or even turn to their employer for a loan.  Students who believe they can pay off the debt, but would struggle to do so in a lump sum, could also ask the college if they’d offer a payment plan, Gonzales Warren said.  In addition to debts owed to the college, adult students may have a complicated financial aid history. Students who leave school without completing a degree are more likely to default on their student loans, a situation that prohibits them from taking on more federal debt. Fortunately, it’s possible to get your federal student loans out of default. Borrowers in this situation who hope to return to school should call their debt collector and ask about rehabilitating or consolidating their loans out of default.  Finally, students who have spent a long time away from school may simply be shocked at the cost of both tuition and some of the extras required for college these days. Washington said she’s had to take on a part-time job to cover expenses like books, parking and the technology required to attend.  Determine how quickly you’re able to progress through school  Typically, the faster a student makes their way through school, the more likely they are to finish, Reed says. But for students with other responsibilities, like caring and financially providing for family, that can be a challenge.  “Taking an enormous salary cut or quitting your job outright,” to make it through college faster, “is not something that everybody is in a financial position to do,” said Klein-Collins.  Both she and Reed advise adults heading to college think about what they can do realistically to get through school as fast as possible, while also keeping in mind that they may still need to keep their full-time job or, at minimum, reduce their hours to part-time.  Have a support system at home  Both experts and students say having the support of family members and friends is crucial to finishing college as an adult. For Washington, who is the primary caregiver for her mother, that meant working with her family to take on some of that responsibility. “Other people have stepped up to help,” she said.  In fact, the support of her family is part of what encouraged Washington to head back to school. It was one of her siblings who first let her know, via text, about the Warrior Way Back program. “They were in agreement with me going back,” she said.  Have a support system at school  Reed suggests adult students find a point of contact at their school who they can talk with about any challenges — academic, logistical or otherwise — they come up against.  “Glitches happen and it’s easy to lose hope,” he said. “Folks within institutions have seen stuff before and so something that might seem overwhelming if you’ve never seen it before, to someone who has been around the block is not that big a deal.”  Finding a point of contact at the university is particularly important for students who decide to pursue their degree solely or mostly online, Reed said. Having “at least one point of human contact” can help students studying online if they get stuck or lost in the course, he said.  Support can also come from fellow students. Washington is still getting used to building relationships and study groups with students who are decades her junior. In the meantime, she’s been able to connect and study with students closer to her age.  Reed said that’s likely to be the case for many adults returning to school or attending for the first time. “A lot of people have a fear of being the only adult in the room, but I think if they show up at most public colleges they’ll find out very quickly that that’s not true,” he said.

Love & Money is a MarketWatch series looking at how our relationship with money impacts our relationships with significant others, friends and family.  Like 40% of students who enter college, life got in the way of Shawnte’ Cain completing her degree.  Cain, 39, began her college career in 1997 at Wayne State University in Detroit. She successfully made it through three years at the school, but just as she could see her degree on the horizon, her grandmother fell ill. School fell by the wayside as Cain cared for her and her own financial obligations rose.  For years, Cain, who works as a casino host at the MGM Grand Detroit, toyed with returning to college, but work and family obligations kept getting in the way. “I was finding barriers to stop me from finishing,” she said recently.  But in 2018, Cain finally re-enrolled at Wayne State thanks in part to a new program at the school called Warrior Way Back, which forgives up to $1,500 in debt former students owed to the school if they return. Of course, coming back to campus after 20 years away wasn’t simple.  Cain enlisted the support of her family to make sure someone would be available to watch her 5-year-old son while she was in school and at work. She found trusted advisors at the school who helped her navigate course work, locate the parking lot closest to her classes and get set up with networking and study groups.  Don’t miss: This Class of 2018 graduate is 66 and one of many older Americans pursuing a degree  And in December of last year, she finally got that degree — fulfilling a promise to her late fiance that she would complete her education — and she’s still on campus taking a few courses to enhance it. “It feels amazing,” she said of graduating. “A lot of boundaries that were placed between myself and my dream job have been lifted.”  Cain may not fit with the image we often conjure when we think of college students — the co-ed lounging in the quad and grabbing a few beers with friends. But these days, the typical student looks more like Cain. Nearly 40% of undergraduates are older than 25 and nearly one-quarter are raising children, according to Lumina Foundation, an organization focused on increasing access to post-high school education.  More “non-traditional” or independent college students attend college than a generation ago, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. “It is important for promoting racial and ethnic equity in college attainment, given the relatively large share of students of color among independent students,” it said in a 2018 report.  There are likely millions more adults out there looking to start college for the first time or go back after years away.  Here are some tips to make that happen:  Choose a school that suits your needs  Working adults with family and other responsibilities have different needs than other students. They should look for schools that can accommodate those priorities, said Rebecca Klein-Collins, author of “Never Too Late:The Adult Student’s Guide to College.”  “Find a college that really understands who you are at this stage in your life and doesn’t make you try to apologize for who you are at this stage in your life,” she said.  Schools that are particularly supportive of adult learners often offer courses outside of normal work hours and have rolling admissions and rolling start dates, Klein-Collins said. They’ll also give students some credit for skills they’ve learned on the job.  Washington Monthly’s ranking of the best colleges for adult learners can be a good place to begin a search for schools that fit this bill.  Another good resource for potential students: The people doing the job they’re hoping to get after graduation, said Matthew Reed, the vice president for learning at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, N.J. He suggests students talk with people a few steps ahead in their career journey and ask them what credential they got and where they earned it. It’s not a question to ask schools.  “No college will say, ‘We’re not very good at X,’” he said. “So skip that entirely.”  Adult students need to be discerning when choosing a school. For-profit colleges often do a great job of catering to students with complicated schedules — and make a point of highlighting that flexibility in their marketing materials — but their outcomes are often poor and come at a high cost.  “Generally speaking when in doubt go public, either community college or a local state university,” Reed said. “Most of the time you’re going to get a better deal.”  Prepare before you go  If you’ve been to college before, Reed suggests pulling together your transcripts and bringing them to any meetings with representatives with the colleges you’re considering. That way, you can get as much credit as possible for work you’ve already done.  Reed also advises students to ask about prior learning assessments, which essentially allow a college to evaluate whether they can give you credit for skills you can prove you learned on the job. “Someone who as worked as an office manager may not need to take the intro to business class,” he said.  Adults who haven’t been in school for several years may also need to brush up on their academic and other skills.  Before Tanganyika Washington returned to Wayne State at age 39 to pursue a teaching degree focused on middle and high school math, she went to online education sites like Khan Academy to brush up on her calculus and trigonometry skills.  “It had been more than 10 years since I had cracked open a textbook and did math on the college level,” said Washington, who studied engineering when she attended Wayne State for the first time in the late 1990s.  Adult students who aren’t tech savvy may want to brush up on their computer skills, given that so much of college these days, including turning in assignments, is conducted online. When Wayne State began bringing students back to campus as part of the Warrior Way Back program, administrators realized they needed to offer an orientation that specifically brought adult students “up to speed for skills that we expect students who are 18 to have, no problem,” said Dawn Medley, the vice president for enrollment management at the school.  Navigating the money piece  Paying for college can be challenging at any age, but for adult students who are likely entirely responsible for the cost — and may have other financial responsibilities — successfully navigating the economics of earning a degree can be particularly important.  Adult students who are working should explore whether their employer can help them pay for school, Reed said. About 90% of midsize or large employers offer some kind of tuition reimbursement. Even when that’s not available, some employers may have an arrangement with certain schools that provide discounts to their workers, Reed said.  “The best case is when the employer pays for it,” Reed said.  Still, it’s likely students will also have to explore some other source of financing. To get access to government grants and loans, they should fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (or FAFSA). But students should be wary of any website trying to charge students to fill out their FAFSA, Reed said. “Do not pay for the FAFSA,” he said. “If they charge you for it, they’re scamming you.”  Students returning to college may also have to work through financial challenges precipitated by leaving school.

202,895214,"Sycamore Advisors LLC is advising the state and Chapman and Cutler LLP and Burke, Burns & Pinelli Ltd are bond counsel.  Illinois' secondary market spreads have widened 10 basis points over the last week with the 10-year set at a 281 basis point spread to Refinitiv Municipal Market Data’s AAA benchmark, its one-year at a 225 basis point spread, and its long, 25-year at a 268 basis point spread. Triple-B spreads, where the state is rated, are trading at spreads of 98 basis points, 126 basis points, and 137 basis points on the 1-year, 10-year, and 25-year, respectively. The state paid record spread penalties in its last sale in May.  The trading levels already reflect the market’s view that the bonds don’t represent an investment grade credit and “from our view point, the rating agencies have been patient but at some point they have to make a move if the numbers warrant it,” said Michael Pietronico, chief executive officer of Miller Tabak Asset Management.  Illinois’ $43 billion general fund budget hinges on about $6 billion of uncertain funding that includes about $1.3 billion from a move to a progressive state income tax structure and federal relief for tax losses.  The former relies on voters Nov. 3 approving a constitutional amendment championed by Gov. J.B. Pritzker that lifts the flat tax requirement. A federal relief package remains elusive amid stark differences between the Democrat-led House, GOP-led Senate and Trump White House.  The budget is balanced in their absence by issuing up to $1.2 billion of general obligation bonds to offset the loss of new income tax revenue in the second half of the fiscal year and up to $5 billion through the Federal Reserve’s Municipal Liquidity Facility, which the state was the first to use for its $1.2 billion note issue in the spring.  Illinois remains eligible to borrow more than $8 billion through the MLF at a set rate based on its ratings of 3.30%. The state must submit a notice of interest by early December for the program that currently expires at the end of the year.  Pritzker recently directed state agencies to identify 5% in cuts for the current fiscal year that runs through June 30 and 10% for fiscal 2022 and top administration officials have long warned of potential double-digit income tax hikes on all if the amendment fails.  The state can avoid a downgrade “whether or not it becomes law” Pietronico said of the tax amendment as “it’s about what they do on the spending side. If they address that, it would be better long term for the finances of the state.”  Some investors might have to sell in the event of a downgrade, but many who can only hold investment grade debt have likely already trimmed their positions so there may not be a big price reduction but it would represent “a political embarrassment for the government,” Pietronico said.  Tax Debate  If voters amend the state constitution to scrap the flat tax requirement, Pritzker's plan would scrap the current 4.95% flat personal income tax rate with the highest tax bracket set at 7.99% for a single filer making at least $750,000. Corporate rates would rise to 7.99%. It would raise $3.1 billion for a full year with increases imposed on the top 3% of filers. The administration has previously said it would generate at least $3.5 billion of new revenue.  The amendment battle has pitted Pritzker, who has put some of his own wealth toward funding a group fighting for passage, against other wealthy Illinois residents like Ken Griffin, founder of Citadel, who is pouring millions into advertisements against it.  Opponents argue the tax could further drive higher-end residents out of state and that the state can’t be trusted with an infusion of new tax revenue without structural changes on spending and pension debts. Opponents also believe that lifting the flat tax requirement could usher in higher taxes on the middle class and make it easier to swallow a small tax on retirement income. Illinois is one of three states that does not tax retirement income.  ""There's no new taxing power. The idea here is to make it fairer. The existing ability for the general assembly to raise revenue or to keep revenues the same or to decrease revenues in the state — that doesn't change,” Pritzker said last week.  To pass muster, the amendment requires either 60% support among those voting on the question or more than 50% of those casting a ballot.  The Illinois Municipal League has taken no position because the state has not committed to restoring cuts to the percentage of income taxes shared with local governments, but Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot supports the change.  The Center for Tax and Budget Accountability agrees with Pritzker on the fairness issue. “It is unfair because such a system fails to allocate tax burden in a manner that correlates with ability to pay, thereby worsening the substantial growth in income inequality that has occurred in the private sector over the last four decades,” the think tank writes of the current system.  The Tax Foundation recently issued a report in opposition warning that the state would reduce its competitiveness because the change would impose some of the highest individual and corporate income taxes among states. The neighboring states of Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, and Missouri have all cut income taxes in recent years, it said.  “Illinois would trail its peers in just about every aspect of its tax code. If businesses and individuals are leaving the state now, these policies can only make the problem worse,” said Senior Policy Analyst Jared Walczak.  The civic arm of a prominent Commercial Club is opposed in the absence of structural budget and policy reforms. “The result will be further loss of jobs and people, long-term cuts in critical social services, a shrinking tax base burdened with growing debt, and a guarantee that Illinois will continue to have the worst credit rating of any state in the country,” a statement read.  Rating agencies affirmed the state at the lowest investment grade level with negative outlooks and red flags throughout the reports over the decisions coming due on borrowing and spending that will guide whether the state avoid a cut to junk.  None of the three say a failed referendum would trigger a downgrade, but the state will need to tread cautiously and action would be needed during the state’s annual fall veto session in late November.  “A downgrade could be triggered by the lack of a credible path to reversing those measures quickly, once an economic recovery finally takes hold, or by a reliance on short-term measures that materially compound the state's long-term challenges such as its pension liability burden,” Fitch said.  Fiscal measures that greatly add to the state's near- or long-term liabilities including a reduction in pension contributions to provide fiscal relief and a large or persistent structural imbalance that leads to significant increase in the state's unpaid bills or other liabilities could drive a downgrade, Moody’s said.  “With the need for additional borrowing, an elevated bill backlog, and lingering substantial structural imbalance, Illinois could exhibit further characteristics of a non-investment-grade issuer,” S&P Global Ratings has warned.  The state closed out fiscal 2020 with a $210 million surplus after closing the shortfall caused by $2.7 billion of COVID-19 wounds to tax collections as revenues performed about $300 million better than the revised estimates. Revenues were revised downward by $4.6 billion for fiscal 2021 but the state will also need to repay $500 million in internal fund borrowing and $1.2 billion of notes.  The state’s list of issues it advises potential buyers of under “investment considerations” covers the weight of its debt from a $7.3 billion bill backlog — which was up to $8.3 billion last week — and a $137 billion pension tab for a system just 40.3% funded as well as the pandemic’s ongoing impact.","Illinois heads into the market Tuesday facing questions about its ability to hold on to investment-grade ratings should voters reject a progressive income tax amendment and federal relief remain stalled.

Fiscal measures that greatly add to the state's near- or long-term liabilities including a reduction in pension contributions to provide fiscal relief and a large or persistent structural imbalance that leads to significant increase in the state's unpaid bills or other liabilities could drive a downgrade, Moody’s said.  “With the need for additional borrowing, an elevated bill backlog, and lingering substantial structural imbalance, Illinois could exhibit further characteristics of a non-investment-grade issuer,” S&P Global Ratings has warned.  The state closed out fiscal 2020 with a $210 million surplus after closing the shortfall caused by $2.7 billion of COVID-19 wounds to tax collections as revenues performed about $300 million better than the revised estimates. Revenues were revised downward by $4.6 billion for fiscal 2021 but the state will also need to repay $500 million in internal fund borrowing and $1.2 billion of notes.  The state’s list of issues it advises potential buyers of under “investment considerations” covers the weight of its debt from a $7.3 billion bill backlog — which was up to $8.3 billion last week — and a $137 billion pension tab for a system just 40.3% funded as well as the pandemic’s ongoing impact."

Can men wear shorts at work?  Unless your office has a dressed-down code, it’s unlikely your boss will be thrilled if you turn up wearing shorts.  While there is no law that says men – or anyone else for that matter – are unable to wear shorts, it is generally frowned upon.  This is because it isn’t a smart look and can leave employees looking unprofessional.  But it does depend on what your office would deem acceptable, and the general dress code adopted there.  Who develops the dress code?  Employers can set dress codes, and employees must abide by them.  It is a set of standards that say what is appropriate for workers to wear.  Dress code can sometimes be a legitimate part of an employer’s terms and conditions of employment.  While standards for men and women don’t have to be identical, the government guidelines say they should be equivalent.  There are cases of unlawful dress codes where female employees have been required to wear high heels.  What do unions say about it?  After receptionist Nicola Thorp was sent home from work for not wearing high heels a petition was sent to the government.  This was rejected but new guidance on work dress code is expected in 2018.  TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “This is a welcome step towards getting rid of sexist dress codes in the workplace. But the new guidance won’t be enough if working people can’t afford to take sexist bosses to a tribunal.”  Also the TUC wants to make it illegal to keep people at work indoors if the temperature is above 30C, and put protection in place for people working outside or driving for a living.  Unfortunately, there isn’t a legally defined maximum or minimum temperature for offices yet.  But your employer is responsible for “keeping the temperature at a comfortable level” and there are rules that could allow you to leave   if the office is too hot.  If you’re a vulnerable employee – for example if you’re pregnant or are undergoing the menopause, or if you need to wear protective equipment at work so can’t take off layers – that also has to be taken into account.  The HSE explains: “If a significant number of employees are complaining about thermal discomfort, your employer should carry out a risk assessment, and act on the results of that assessment.”  So the answer is simple – if you’re uncomfortable, tell your boss and if enough people complain then they have to act.","While there is no law that says men-or anyone else for that matter-are unable to wear shorts, it is generally frowned upon

204,880337,"JD Wetherspoon was founded by chairman Tim Martin in 1979, and has gone on to become a UK institution.  There’s now more than 800 Wetherspoon pubs across the country, serving meals and booze at low prices.  New Channel 5 documentary Wetherspoons: How Do They Do It?, which aired on Monday July 5, has revealed the secrets behind the chain’s success.  Appeals to everyone  If you’ve ever popped into your local Wetherspoon for lunch or an after work pint, you’ll know that there’s no such thing as a typical ‘Spoons customer.  The pub chain’s appeal across age ranges and class lines is part of its recipe for success.  “It’s where the post office workers go when they’ve finished their shifts, its where the teachers go, it’s where the old ladies go and sit on their own,” one former employee told the documentary makers.  It was also one of the first to embrace all day trading – serving breakfast, lunch, dinner and evening drinks.  This means it gets more people through the doors, and, with them, more money.  Owns its own pubs  Something that sets Wetherspoons apart from other pubs is the grand settings that some of them occupy, taking over former cinemas, churches and opera houses.  Many rival pubs are owned by big brewers who charge pub landlords low rent on the condition they buy all their booze from them at higher prices.  But Wetherspoons operates under a different model, and owns many of its own buildings, meaning pub bosses can buy from anyone they want.  And with the amount of beer Wetherspoons sells, everyone is keen to supply them, meaning management can strike good deals.  Speedy service  Former staff members told the documentary team that the most popular alcohol is put on a “speed rail” under the bar to offer easy access on busy nights.  This means employees can make the drink at the bar rather than having to check elsewhere for the correct bottle.  Speed of service and turnaround is the key to Wetherspoons’ success, as the faster drinks are poured the more can be sold.  It’s a similar story in the kitchen, where meals are churned out using microwaves and deep fat fryers.  Staff are told there is a 10 minute time target between taking an order to the food being delivered to the customer.  Precise pouring  Another way ‘Spoons saves money on booze is by being very careful about the amount of beer poured into each pint.  Every pint must be 5% froth and managers can apparently test this by weighing the beer.  Ex-staff members said they weigh the glass first and then they’re told by head office what the weight should be with the correct head size.  Drip trays are also emptied each night to get accurate account of wastage from each line.  This is because minimum waste results in the best profit.  Upselling  All consumers will have experienced upselling at a pub or restaurant at some point.  And the money-making tactic used to be part of Wetherspoons’ official training strategy – although the chain has now ditched that method.  Former staff members revealed they would ask customers whether they’d prefer a double or single shot of spirit – in that order.  That is because saying “double” first encourages consumers to settle for the bigger, more expensive option.  Ex-employees also revealed they would suggest more expensive food items.  Or instead of asking “do you want any onion rings”, they would say “how many onion rings do you want?”.  Wetherspoon told the documentary that it ditched the strategy in 2015 and now does meal deals instead.  It also said it has discouraged the upselling of spirits for more than a decade.  Meal clubs  Wetherspoons’ meal club nights have earned the chain huge popularity.  There is a club day available every day of the week, such as Mexican Mondays, Tuesday Steak Club and Fish and Chip Friday.  But the most popular and well-known is the Thursday Curry Club.  It offers value for money by selling pub grub classics at low prices – and the food is delivered frozen before being microwaved to cut cooking costs.  Price watch  Former staff members told the documentary team that they would be sent to check the prices offered by competitiors in their local area.  Then the pub chain would try and keep it under the local average, which is why there’s such a range of prices in Wetherspoons pubs across the UK.  Brits can order from the bar again and QR code check in will be scrapped from July 19.  Pubs and restaurants including Wetherspoons have been forced to close venues due to self-isolating workers.

Plans by the Conservative Alliance in Sweden to scrap wealth tax and to partially finance this by placing a ceiling on tax deductions for private pension savings has been criticised by the insurance sector. Insurance firms are concerned that the proposal, with a SEK 12,000 (US$ 1,721 EUR 1,293) ceiling per person and year, could have a serious impact on long-term pension saving, and will encourage short-term consumption rather than saving. Currently some 300,000 people make tax deductions for private pension savings between SEK 12,000 and SEK 20,000 per year. Bengt-Åke Fagerman at  Skandia Liv is concerned that regulations are again about to be changed on the market and this could damage public confidence in the entire pension savings system.

208,237848,"* Apply a Bunching Strategy. Are your itemized deductions less that 150 percent of the standard deduction? If so, consider a bunching strategy, where you apply the standardized deduction one year, and itemize deductions the following year. In the itemized deduction year, consider paying two years' worth of property taxes and making multi-year payments for other expenses. Consider, too, paying for business items and professional development expenses during an itemized year to reduce lost itemized deductions based on adjusted gross income. Remember, though, that paying additional property tax and taking more miscellaneous deductions in one year could subject you to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Don't overlook annual miscellaneous expenses, such as investment journal subscriptions, safe deposit box rentals, and brokerage fees for taxable investment accounts.    * Evaluate 2006 Tax Credits. Tax credits for 2006 residential energy property expenditures range from $50 for an advanced main air circulation fan, to $300 for any energy-efficient building property item. Buyers qualify for tax credits ranging from $400 to $3,400 for new hybrid vehicles purchased after January 1, 2006. Tax credit considerations include vehicle weight, fuel economy, and lifetime fuel savings.    * Fund IRA/401(K) Plans. Everyone should set aside as much as possible for retirement funding. For a 401(k) plan, contribute enough to fully benefit from an employer's matching funds, and try to make the maximum $15,000 contribution. Individuals 50 years old or older can add ""catch up"" contributions up to $5,000. Self-employed individuals should establish self-employed retirement plans. The new Roth 401(k) plans give younger employees in lower tax brackets a great way to get long-term, tax-free appreciation. High school or college-age children with part-time job income can also contribute up to $4,000, or the amount they earned, to a Roth IRA.    * Capitalize on FSA Rule Changes. The IRS recently approved a grace period until March 15 for employees to use the previous year's Flexible Spending Account funds. A recent IRS ruling allows fund reimbursements for a number of over-the-counter items, including antacids and cold tablets, as well as weight loss or smoking cessation aids. Some reimbursements may require a doctor's approval.    * Consider Gifts to Individuals. The annual gift tax exclusion for 2006 was raised to $12,000 per individual. Gifting enables you to transfer investments to a child or someone else who is in a lower tax bracket. A child younger than 14 years old can have an unearned (investment) income of $1,700 for 2006, before subjecting parents to the ""kiddie tax"" rules. The first $850 is tax free, with the next $850 subject to a 10 percent tax bracket.    * Be Tax-Wise in Charitable Giving. Giving appreciated stock enables you to make a valuable charitable contribution without paying capital gains tax on that stock. When donating a used car, inquire whether the charity will sell the car, or use it for charitable activities. The latter may yield a bigger deduction. For a sale, the price the charity gets is the donated value. Bank-issued credit cards can also be used to make charitable contributions, even if the card balance isn't paid until 2007.    * Coordinate Capital Gains/Losses.    You are limited to $3,000 in annual net losses. Try to offset short-term gains against short-term losses so that when you sell stocks with long-term capital gains, they are taxed at the 15 percent tax bracket. Also, take deductions for investment interest when you are taking the deduction against short-term capital gains, rather than long-term capital gains, which are taxed at 15 percent.    * Avoid Penalties for Underpaying Estimates. If penalized for underpaying estimated taxes, increase your withholding tax or estimated tax payments.    * Invest in a 529 College Savings Plan. If you are saving for a child's or grandchild's college education, contribute to a 529 college savings plan. The contributions are treated as annual gifts, up to $12,000 per beneficiary. If you exceed that annual amount, you can elect on a gift tax return to take the contributions into account ratably over five years, as long as the five-year total per beneficiary does not exceed $60,000. ($120,000 for you and your spouse). Earnings are tax free when used for qualifying educational expenses.    Get Started...Now!

Individuals 50 years old or older can add ""catch up"" contributions up to $5,000. Self-employed individuals should establish self-employed retirement plans. The new Roth 401(k) plans give younger employees in lower tax brackets a great way to get long-term, tax-free appreciation. High school or college-age children with part-time job income can also contribute up to $4,000, or the amount they earned, to a Roth IRA.    * Capitalize on FSA Rule Changes. The IRS recently approved a grace period until March 15 for employees to use the previous year's Flexible Spending Account funds. A recent IRS ruling allows fund reimbursements for a number of over-the-counter items, including antacids and cold tablets, as well as weight loss or smoking cessation aids. Some reimbursements may require a doctor's approval.    * Consider Gifts to Individuals. The annual gift tax exclusion for 2006 was raised to $12,000 per individual. Gifting enables you to transfer investments to a child or someone else who is in a lower tax bracket. A child younger than 14 years old can have an unearned (investment) income of $1,700 for 2006, before subjecting parents to the ""kiddie tax"" rules. The first $850 is tax free, with the next $850 subject to a 10 percent tax bracket.    * Be Tax-Wise in Charitable Giving. Giving appreciated stock enables you to make a valuable charitable contribution without paying capital gains tax on that stock. When donating a used car, inquire whether the charity will sell the car, or use it for charitable activities. The latter may yield a bigger deduction. For a sale, the price the charity gets is the donated value. Bank-issued credit cards can also be used to make charitable contributions, even if the card balance isn't paid until 2007.    * Coordinate Capital Gains/Losses.    You are limited to $3,000 in annual net losses. Try to offset short-term gains against short-term losses so that when you sell stocks with long-term capital gains, they are taxed at the 15 percent tax bracket. Also, take deductions for investment interest when you are taking the deduction against short-term capital gains, rather than long-term capital gains, which are taxed at 15 percent.    * Avoid Penalties for Underpaying Estimates. If penalized for underpaying estimated taxes, increase your withholding tax or estimated tax payments.    * Invest in a 529 College Savings Plan. If you are saving for a child's or grandchild's college education, contribute to a 529 college savings plan. The contributions are treated as annual gifts, up to $12,000 per beneficiary. If you exceed that annual amount, you can elect on a gift tax return to take the contributions into account ratably over five years, as long as the five-year total per beneficiary does not exceed $60,000. ($120,000 for you and your spouse). Earnings are tax free when used for qualifying educational expenses.    Get Started...Now!    The benefits you'll see next tax season from implementing tax-saving strategies now will be significant. Over years and decades, those benefits compound in value. So, what are you waiting for?

Three weeks after the start of weapons inspections, the question of access to Iraqi weapons scientists poses one of the biggest challenges yet to U.N. efforts to disarm Iraq. The Bush administration last week repeated its demand that President Saddam Hussein deliver top weapons scientists for interviews outside Iraq. So far, Iraq has given no clear sign that it will cooperate, despite U.S. threats that a refusal could lead to armed conflict.  Hans Blix, the chief U.N. weapons inspector, on Thursday asked Iraq in a letter to turn over the names of all scientists involved in Iraq's previous biological, chemical and nuclear weapons programs, as required by a Security Council resolution. Meanwhile, the White House is preparing its own list - a who's who of top Iraqi scientists based on the assessments of U.S. intelligence agencies, U.S. and U.N. officials said.  The identities of the individual scientists have not been disclosed, but intelligence officials and weapons experts say many of the names are well known from Iraqi documents and seven years of intensive weapons inspections in the 1990s. Collectively, the lists represent the best hope of the United States and the United Nations for uncovering the truth about Saddam's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction, the officials said.  ""The one thing that survived the Gulf War and sanctions was Iraq's brain trust,"" said a Pentagon intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""It's one thing to go to Iraq and see a piece of equipment. But the most important thing is to be able to talk to the guy who worked the equipment.""  The scientists who will likely make up the U.S. list reflect nearly every type of weapons specialty, from relatively crude chemical weapons, such as mustard gas, to nuclear bombs. Many have earned degrees from prestigious U.S. and British universities. Some received specialized training - and, in the case of Taha, live cultures of deadly bacteria - directly from the United States through legal academic or commercial connections.  Whether the scientists will talk - or possibly defect - is uncertain. Saddam in the past retained the loyalty of his scientists through a combination of privileges and threats, including an explicit threat of imprisonment, torture and death for scientists and their family members. One of Iraq's best-known nuclear scientists, Jaffar Dhia Jaffar, was persuaded to head Saddam's nuclear program only after a stint in a Baghdad prison.  But if their safety can be guaranteed, at least some of the scientists would almost certainly jump at a chance to defect, according to former weapons inspectors and an Iraqi defector who worked with many of them. Exactly how those guarantees would be made, and how and where the interviews would be conducted, remain matters of intense debate.  ""In my opinion, 80 to 90 percent will defect,"" said Khidhir Hamza, a former Iraqi nuclear scientist who left in 1994 and now lives in Virginia. ""Think about it: If you're an Iraqi scientist getting by on a few dollars a month and you have a chance to live in freedom with your family for the rest of your life - why wouldn't you cooperate?""","If U.N. officials get the opportunity to question Iraq's scientists about hidden weapons programs, near the top of the list will be a 47-year-old mother with black hair streaked in gray and a talent for growing anthrax bacteria.

211,92113,"Under more stringent ""fiduciary"" standards, brokers would need to justify if they are recommending a security that is more expensive than other options available or that may be underperforming, retirement experts say. Current rules only require that the investment be ""suitable,"" which doesn't place as much emphasis on cost and performance.  The president endorsed the tighter standards at a press event at AARP on Monday, stressing that excessive fees hurt middle class families who are trying to improve their long-term security by saving for retirement. ""You should have the peace of mind of knowing that the advice you're getting for investing those dollars is sound,"" he said.  The proposed rule is expected to be published in several months, after receiving approval from the White House's Office of Management and Budget. It would then be published and subject to public comments.  The exact details of the proposed rules won't be available until the Labor Department's announcement in a few months, but the changes are targeting Individual Retirement Accounts, which hold more than $7 trillion in savings for more than 40 million Americans.  An estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets are invested in products that provide payments that lead to conflicts of interest, according to research released Monday by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.  Weak consumer protections cost IRA investors up to $17 billion a year in excessive fees, the report said. Administration officials say the new rules would not eliminate commission payments.  ""Numerous studies have found that some advisers consistently steer customers to high fee products despite the fact that high fee products don't perform any better,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren during the AARP event.  The new rules are expected to generate strong resistance from financial institutions, which argue the added restrictions could make it more difficult for savers to get potentially useful advice. ""This re-proposal could make it harder to save for retirement by cutting access to affordable advice and limiting options for savers,"" said Kenneth E. Bentsen,president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  Brian Graff, executive director of the National Association of Plan Advisers, said the new rules may force savers to end long-standing relationships with advisers. The change could make it harder for savers to roll their savings into an IRA, where they may benefit from having more investment options than they do in a 401(k) plan, even if some of those options are more expensive, he says.  The Labor Department tried to adjust the standards for retirement advisers in 2010 but withdrew the proposal after receiving strong resistance from the financial industry. White House and Labor Department officials made it clear that these new rules would not ban commissions.  There are three main conflicts that can exist when a person receives advice from a broker, according to a White House memo leaked to the news media last month. Some investors are encouraged to roll over assets from a 401(k) plan into an IRA, without receiving warning that the fees they incur in the new plan may be higher than what they were previously paying. Some brokers receiving payments when investors buy a certain fund or security, may recommend that clients buy and sell those products more often than needed, causing them to pay those fees repeatedly and unnecessarily.  Other advisers attempt to justify their fees by recommending that clients use actively managed funds. But when those funds underperform low-cost index funds, investors are stuck with a double whammy of lower returns and higher investment costs.  The council estimates these conflicts reduce investment returns by 1 percentage point each year, which could reduce savings by more than a quarter over 35 years. Put another way, a $10,000 investment would normally grow to more than $38,000 over that time period, after adjusting for inflation, would instead be worth $27,500.  A typical worker who rolls over a 401(k) to an IRA at age 45 will lose an estimated 17 percent from her account by age 65. For someone with $100,000 in retirement savings, receiving conflicted advice could limit growth to $179,000 by age 65—a loss of $37,000 when compared to someone not receiving that conflicting advice.  ""You could end up with tens of thousands of dollars less simply because your adviser isn't required to put your best interests first,"" said Jeff Zients, director of the White House National Economic Council.  Some investors may not be aware of the conflicting interests that could encourage their advisers to steer them into costly products or to make moves that could leave them with a loss. A 2013 survey of retirement savers by AARP found that about 50 percent of respondents were ""less likely"" to trust their plan providers after learning that advice they offer is not currently required to be in their best interest.  ""Most of the general public has no idea that there are different kinds of advisers or different kinds of standards,"" says David Certner, legislative policy director for the AARP. ""Most of them assume that the advisers are working in their best interest.""  Once the Labor Department issues the proposed rules, investors will get a chance to submit comments in writing and in a public hearing. After reviewing the feedback, the administration will decide what to include in a final rule, which will not go into effect immediately after it's finalized.

213,409969,"But the couple were left humiliated when Nationwide called and said they had been turned down: their custom was not welcome. They were told a bad debt was to blame.  Mr Lewis, 70, a retired flight engineer, says: 'We had never been turned down for anything before. I couldn't understand what had happened.'  They pleaded with Nationwide to find out what had gone wrong. Finally, they were advised to check their credit report. When it arrived, it showed they had failed to repay £336 on a Nationwide credit card in 2008.  Mr Lewis say: 'The record was simply not right. We'd been victims of fraud while on holiday in Australia and the card had been cancelled. I rang the credit reference company and said: ""You've libelled me."" We were so angry with them.  'Had we needed a mortgage, we couldn't have got one. We felt we were blamed for something that wasn't our fault.'  Credit reports, and the agencies that compile these records, have taken over our lives. They hold data on every adult in the UK and use this information to rack up vast profits. So powerful are these firms, it is impossible to move home, change mobile phone or switch current account without their say so.  But when the information held by the credit agencies is wrong, the effects can be devastating. What's more, the information can prove almost impossible to change.  THE BIG NAMES THAT RULE YOUR LIFE  The three main credit reference agencies in Britain are Experian, Callcredit and Equifax, who put together huge databases of information supplied by banks, energy companies and mobile phone firms.  On top of this, they add details such as where you live, which they take from the electoral roll. The idea is that this gives a complete picture of how you spend your money, what your habits are and how good you are at repaying debts.  Firms pay the agencies to see this data. They can then use it, along with their own information, to make decisions about whether to accept you as a customer.  Your details are worth a fortune.  Experian is a FTSE 100 company with headquarters in Dublin and offices in Nottingham. Last year, it took revenues of £539 million in the UK (up from £479 million in 2011). It had no UK corporation tax bill, and instead got a credit of £159 million from the Treasury. It said the tax credit related to losses racked up in previous years.  Equifax, which is based in the U.S., in Atlanta, Georgia, reported that revenues from the UK increased by 6 pc last year to £87 million.  Callcredit, which was founded by Skipton Building Society but is now owned by a private equity firm, saw its operating profits jump by 40 pc last year to £17.3 million.  A real money-spinner for the firms is the masses of information they hold on you: everything from whether you have claimed on your insurance policies to the kind of savings account you use.  Callcredit boasts it holds the personal details of 43 million people. This includes 26 million residential addresses, 20 million landline numbers and 15 million mobile numbers.  Among the data it may know about you are the ages of your children, the angle of your garden (useful information for firms that sell solar panels or satellite dishes), whether you have a burglar alarm fitted, the make and mileage of your car, how much you spend on wine, sports and vitamins, if you gamble, where you go on holiday and what you read.  These details aren't on your credit file but are collected because they're a gold mine for any company that wants to sell you something.  These personal details are then sold to marketing companies by middle-men called data resellers. Callcredit says that 95 pc of all data resellers use its service. A further chunk of profits comes from selling complex computer programs to businesses, allowing them to interpret the details in your credit report. These programs are what bank staff use when you apply for a loan.  Not only do they allow them to decide whether to lend to you, but they can also indicate whether you will be a profitable customer.  Experian sells a program that alerts your bank if you are likely to need more credit in the near future. Based on this, the banks will be able to flog you a new credit card or loan.  Equifax uses your data to allow insurers to see if you may be a risky customer. It has a similar service for energy suppliers — allowing them to highlight anyone whose record shows that they had failed to repay a bill. All three firms run tracing services to track down people who have defaulted on bills.  A final money-making ploy is to get you to subscribe to see your file. By law, credit reference firms must give you your credit report for £2 by post, or £4 over the phone. The agencies say they don't make money from these reports.  They show just a very basic list of your current address, any financial agreements you have, your credit limits, and whether you have repaid on time dating back over the past six years.  But the agencies also encourage you to sign up to services that claim to let you analyse your file and improve it by taking out certain types of loans and credit cards.  Experian charges £9.99 a month, and Equifax £9.99. Callcredit offers a free service called Noddle. However, with Experian's service, for example, anyone who signs up is pointed to a list of credit cards they could apply for.  WHO WATCHes THE CREDIT spIES?  Michael Cole, 65, a businessman from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, had never checked his credit report until last year. He was planning to buy a new buy-to-let property and became worried when the bank he had applied to for a mortgage started asking increasingly detailed personal questions.  So, he checked his credit file with Equifax and uncovered a list of errors.  It said he had lived at a previous address for three years, when it was in fact 25, and it incorrectly claimed he owed BT £89.  His current credit card wasn't listed but lists of credit and store cards that he had closed years ago were.  It took Mr Cole five months to resolve the errors. The dispute forced him to put the buy-to-let project on hold. He says: 'I have asked where Equifax got the information from. They never told me.  'The whole system appears to be out of control and unregulated. There are no penalties for damage caused by the errors of these companies, yet the impact they can have on people's lives is devastating.'  Correcting wrong information on your credit file can be hugely inconvenient, and leave you struggling financially. The system is weighted in favour of the banks. It is up to you to spot errors and fight them.  The agencies say they constantly check information. They argue they make very few errors compared with the amount of data they process  However, a survey by consumer group Which? found that as many as one in eight credit reports is incorrect.  Britain's biggest High Street names treat your credit report as gospel, and however much you protest they won't budge until it is corrected at source.  But you can't change your credit file yourself . The only alteration you can make is to put a note of no more than 200 words next to the black mark.  Only the bank, insurance company or mobile phone provider that filed the incorrect record can change it, so you must take up the dispute with them through the credit reference agencies.  Banks have 28 days to investigate. If they fail to resolve your problem, your record will remain incorrect — though it may be marked as disputed.  After this you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.  The Information Commissioner's Office also checks whether the credit agencies and the banks are complying with the Data Protection Act.  the shop staff who can see your file  There are no official rules over who can see your data. The only proviso is that they are part of a firm that has subscribed to the credit reference agency database and that there is a legitimate reason why they would need to see it.  Any staff who can access your file must abide by the Data Protection Act. However, they do not have to undergo training or hold any qualifications before they can see your file — though many big banks and insurance companies do insist on this.  You must give permission for your report to be accessed — but it is possible you can do this unwittingly as it often forms part of an application for a loan, credit card or mobile phone.  In reality, most of the time an organisation does a credit check on you, the person viewing your file cannot see your specific personal details.  What they are looking at will be a rating given to you by that company's computer systems, which have analysed your details. This may be as simple as 'accept' or 'reject'.  This is the practice with most High Street names. However, the growth of credit files has raised concerns over how smaller firms can use your details, and whether anyone from a secretary to a director can see your record.  All the credit agencies stress that they make every effort to protect the personal information.

214,432720," The firm is pursuing ventures ranging from the restoration of the historic The Woods House in Hazelwood into a Scottish pub to a new software platform soon to be launched to help with America’s student loan crisis.  What has it been like opening a pub in the middle of a pandemic? It has been a challenge to say the least. This has been a three-year project, and the entire team has been super-motivated and committed through the historic rehabilitation activities over the last few years and defining the Scottish pub theme. We were all anxiously waiting to see this vision come true last year and have Pittsburgers come, enjoy the house, the grounds, cherish our history and have a great time. When Covid hit last year, it took the wind out of our sails. Initially, we thought we could target summer/fall for openings, but as you know, that was not possible as things spiked. It has been very hard to make operational decisions, keep people motivated and at the same time stay focused on the business side of things. Financially, this has been a huge investment, and we are still not sure how things will pan out in the coming months. Regardless, we intend to do the best we can while staying within all regulations imposed by the city and state.  What was it about the opportunity to pursue The Woods House project that your firm couldn’t turn down? How could we not try and save one of the oldest homes in Pittsburgh, built in 1792, a national treasure? (It was) built by one of the founding families of Pittsburgh who played a significant role in the Whiskey Rebellion and performed the original survey of Pittsburgh.  What was it about your firm’s consulting practice that led you into real estate development and operating an historic pub? Oak Moss’s strength is in developing, managing and executing complex capital projects. While the partners were at Alcoa, we worked on large projects in the billions of dollars, from start to finish. The principles and processes for success are the same on real estate projects. It was a natural fit. The historic pub, while a smaller venture, had tremendous development complexities ranging from community engagement, oversight from three historic agencies and of course ensuring we met all of the URA’s (Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh) requirements. At Oak Moss, we pride ourselves in making the complex simple. The Woods House Pub was a natural fit for Oak Moss to step in.  How do these ventures fit into what you do? All the ventures that I am involved in today have a few things in common — they involve multiple stakeholders, have many moving parts, and success depends on how well one can connect the dots to focus on the highest-impact activities. Megatrends and challenges facing us today such as lack of equitable housing and the student loan crisis have been the reason for our focus on the Woods Village Project (a housing project in Hazelwood to build 66 new homes) and a new fintech start-up called LoanBYE.  What is LoanBYE? It’s a software platform that would allow employers to make contributions to their employees’ student loans. The student loan issue in this country is massive with a total debt of $1.6 trillion and the average loan balance of $40,000. People in their 20s and 30s right now are not saving, not putting any money in their 401Ks. They’re just trying to make these monthly payments. It’s almost ironical that companies are not helping these people to pay down the debt. Employees would rather see a benefit like this, and they’re going to be much more loyal. … We offer software, and we offer a service.  What has it been like for Oak Moss to get through the pandemic? It has been a roller coaster ride with certain projects getting canceled and others put on hold. The lack of travel and face-to-face meetings severely limits the ability of small management consulting companies to build a sustainable pipeline. Also, a lot of the work we do is very strategic and is best done in person. The move to online meetings has been tough in that aspect. The pandemic also reinforced to us the value of maintaining strong networks and keeping in touch with all our contacts, even if just to see how they are doing and if we can help them.  Has it hurt your firm or helped it? I think it is both. Our growth has been slowed, but our focus is sharper now. We have taken the time to really understand our strengths and the areas where we can beat the competition and deliver significant value to clients and stakeholders.  How has it changed how you feel about the future prospects of your company? I feel good about where we are today.

215,1381291,"But former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser gave tentative backing to the policy, saying it should help people ""at the margin"" enter the property market and that caution among banks would prevent borrowers taking on excessive debt.  Under the Coalition's election-eve proposal - which was swiftly matched by Labor - first home buyers will only need a 5 per cent deposit for a mortgage compared to the usual 20 per cent. The government will effectively guarantee the difference for up to 10,000 people a year.  But borrowing the difference between a 5 and 20 per cent deposit will bite the new home owners for the length of a 30-year mortgage.  On a $500,000 property, a first-time buyer now has to stump up $100,000 deposit, leaving them with a $400,000 mortgage. Over the life of a 30 year loan, the buyer would pay $304,000 in interest with monthly repayments of $1956.  But a 5 per cent deposit on the same property would be $25,000, forcing the buyer to borrow $475,000. Over the life of that loan, they would pay $57,000 more in interest than someone with a 20 per cent deposit.  Of more immediate concern would be the monthly repayment of $2327, or $371 more than the person who had a larger deposit.  Someone taking out a mortgage on a $400,000 property would face $289,000 in interest under the Coalition's proposal compared to $247,000 if they had a 20 per cent deposit.  A person with 20 per cent downpayment would make a $1565 monthly repayment compared to $1858 for someone with the bare minimum deposit.

First-home buyers using the Coalition's controversial deposit scheme will pay tens of thousands of dollars in extra interest and face larger monthly repayments in a major windfall for some of Australia's largest banks and lenders.

As Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded the policy would have a ""firming"" affect on falling house prices, experts warned a key element of the plan will actually leave first-time buyers in debt for much longer.
But former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser gave tentative backing to the policy, saying it should help people ""at the margin"" enter the property market and that caution among banks would prevent borrowers taking on excessive debt.  Under the Coalition's election-eve proposal - which was swiftly matched by Labor - first home buyers will only need a 5 per cent deposit for a mortgage compared to the usual 20 per cent. The government will effectively guarantee the difference for up to 10,000 people a year.  But borrowing the difference between a 5 and 20 per cent deposit will bite the new home owners for the length of a 30-year mortgage.  On a $500,000 property, a first-time buyer now has to stump up $100,000 deposit, leaving them with a $400,000 mortgage. Over the life of a 30 year loan, the buyer would pay $304,000 in interest with monthly repayments of $1956.  But a 5 per cent deposit on the same property would be $25,000, forcing the buyer to borrow $475,000. Over the life of that loan, they would pay $57,000 more in interest than someone with a 20 per cent deposit.  Of more immediate concern would be the monthly repayment of $2327, or $371 more than the person who had a larger deposit.  Someone taking out a mortgage on a $400,000 property would face $289,000 in interest under the Coalition's proposal compared to $247,000 if they had a 20 per cent deposit.  A person with 20 per cent downpayment would make a $1565 monthly repayment compared to $1858 for someone with the bare minimum deposit.  Mr Fraser, who also chaired ME Bank after running the RBA between 1989 and 1996, said the banks' current caution would protect borrowers.

218,961408,"Her worries prompted Darkow to attend a Jan. 10 presentation on memory loss and driving at the Chanhassen Library, sponsored by the Chanhassen Senior Center and Senior Commission, Chanhassen's ACT On Alzheimer's group, and Prairie Adult Care in Eden Prairie.  Kathy Kiefer, an occupational therapist from Regions Hospital in St. Paul is a driving rehabilitation specialist, who spoke to a group of a half dozen adults.  The majority of attendees were spouses concerned about the driving ability of a loved one and how to broach the subject of their driving retirement.  DRIVING PROGRAM  The Regions Driving Ability Program was developed in 2006 to screen aging drivers, Kiefer explained.  The Regions program has a neurologist and two driving rehabilitation specialists, including Kiefer. Clients need to be referred by a healthcare provider to participate.  Pre-screening is covered by medical insurance. It involves an interview with Kiefer, a questionnaire, vision testing similar to those at the Department of Motor Vehicles, tests to gauge response time to a light board, and a driving simulator in which the client is seated in a mock-up of a vehicle, watching a video screen, driving streets and roadways for six minutes.  Clients get one practice session and then do six trials. The driving simulator enables Kiefer to evaluate the client's brake pedal reaction time, foot pedal coordination, and how they navigate streets, signs and traffic. The most common feedback clients give her at the simulator is ""I'd rather be in my own car.""  Based on the results, Kiefer and the client's care team make one of several decisions.  If there are no concerns with driving, they may suggest common driving restrictions — no freeway/highway driving, daytime driving only.  With very mild or mild memory loss, Kiefer will recommend a behind-the-wheel driving evaluation. In a separate appointment, Kiefer visits the client's home with her specially equipped Dodge Charger car. The client gets behind the wheel with Kiefer, who directs the driver to drive to familiar places like the grocery store, the church, the bank.  Kiefer evaluates how well the client navigates familiar roadways; she also creates planned mistakes, testing the driver's problem solving skills — negotiating a detour, road construction, side of the road distractions; and can they still drive to the bank or church when they don't start from their own home?  The cost is $275 and is not covered by insurance. Kiefer may determine the person is still able to drive safely; she may also schedule a follow up behind the wheel test in six months or a year. The follow-up evaluation is $150.  And, in some cases, either after the first evaluation or the behind the wheel evaluation, Kiefer recommends driving retirement.  ""I want people to be able to drive, but it always has to be about safety,"" Kiefer said, ""my client's safety and the safety of the community.""  HURDLES  One of the biggest hurdles in working with families with a loved one with dementia is embarrassment, said Mary Blazanin, Chanhassen Senior Center coordinator. ""If someone had a broken leg and walked into a room, you wouldn't be embarrassed about that,"" Blazanin said. ""It's the same thing with dementia, people have broken brains.""  And, discussing someone's driving ability is also an emotional one, one that can be upsetting between spouses, and adult children and their parents.  It's a topic that Darkow is wrestling with.  ""None of us have a Magic 8 Ball on driving, and your shelf life on driving. It's not like you know you have six months, 14 days and two hours. It would make things easier,"" Darkow said, ""but no one has that.""  RETIREMENT TALK  Kiefer suggested several ways of approaching the subject with the driver.  It might be the spouse or the significant other, Kiefer said, or one of the adult children.  Kiefer suggested that often, fathers will respond more positively when it's a son who brings up the topic. ""But consider the personality of the person, the gender, family dynamics."" Sometimes the family physician is a great place to start as they're perceived as a person of authority.  Sometimes the most effective strategy is just planting a seed in a casual conversation, Kiefer said. But the most important thing is to begin talking about it with the family member early on. She suggests taking a drive with the parent, taking notes and making observations that can be shared later, prefaced with phrases like, ""I noticed that you didn't stop at the light … "" or ""I see that it was hard to stay in your lane.""  The bottom line for Kiefer is, ""Let's not get to the point where the Minnesota Driver and Vehicle Services are involved, in the case of an accident. We have to impose a decision that is not fun. It's difficult.""","Brenda Darkow of Chanhassen has concerns about a relative who may be beginning to show signs of memory loss.

219,753542,"Last month, they started Retirement Specialists LLC to help new retirees navigate the maze of information, jargon and potential confusion surrounding Medicare and help direct them toward the right health insurance taking into account an individual's financial situation and health conditions as they enter retirement.  All three are trained social workers. Until last month, Harvey and Vandre worked for Sauk County Aging and Disability Resource Center as legal advocates. Olson comes from Dean Healthcare specializing in Deancare Gold.  The three left their jobs last month to embark on a new business, where all agreed they could help people more thoroughly by going into private practice.  ""People nearing retirement get inundated with information about Medicare and insurance policies and Part D plans, and no matter what their business was, they are not experts in this,"" Vandre said. ""We've all spent 20-plus years working with older people in the areas of Medicare and all things health insurance.""  Harvey said that in her years of working for the county, she wasn't able to refer older people to what she believed would be the best health insurance plans available. ADRC workers are able to help seniors navigate Medicare, but cannot recommend one private insurance plan over another.  ""I'd have to say to them, 'You really have to go look in the phone book or find an agent,'"" Harvey said. ""The hard part for me was once people get past that six months of getting Medicare, they're under this false impression they can come and go out of health insurance, and you can't.""  That's because a new health insurance provider requires a health questionnaire, the results of which can be used to deny coverage.  After partnering with her colleagues, Harvey said she has the freedom to advise clients to choose an insurance plan like Physicians Mutual.  ""It's A-plus rated,"" Harvey said. ""I can't say enough about it. It's the on-going service, and we're right here. We don't take the money and run.""  Selling insurance plans may be the bread and butter of their business, but the three say they perform a lot of pro bono work because Medicare is so confusing to new retirees.  Olson's experise for the last 17 years was with Deancare Gold. However, starting in January 2016, that plan no longer will be sold. She said a new Medicare Advantage Plan will be released this fall.  Rather than work with an entirely new Medicare program through Dean, Olson decided to join Vandre and Harvey in the new endeavor.  Vandre said they strive to take the time and explain to people what it means to sign up for Medicare for the first time, and to talk about why they are such believers in Physicians Mutual for health care benefits in retirement.  ""They have quality products and amazing service,"" Vandre said. ""They're a mutual, so every policy holder is a member, like a co-op. The company puts preventative care first, and they invest in preventative care.""  Harvey said it's also affordable.  ""In the 21 years I've done this job, I have never seen an insurance company go down in rates and Physicians Mutual went down seven percent this year,"" Harvey said.

With a combined 70-plus years helping Medicare recipients and supplemental insurance customers, three long-time friends and colleagues say they are now ""on a mission"" to help seniors and retirees.

New business partners Trish Vandre of Barboo, Deb Harvey of Portage and Mary Olson of Lodi said they have spent too many years seeing older people make the wrong decisions when choosing health insurance coverage.
Last month, they started Retirement Specialists LLC to help new retirees navigate the maze of information, jargon and potential confusion surrounding Medicare and help direct them toward the right health insurance taking into account an individual's financial situation and health conditions as they enter retirement.  All three are trained social workers. Until last month, Harvey and Vandre worked for Sauk County Aging and Disability Resource Center as legal advocates. Olson comes from Dean Healthcare specializing in Deancare Gold.  The three left their jobs last month to embark on a new business, where all agreed they could help people more thoroughly by going into private practice.  ""People nearing retirement get inundated with information about Medicare and insurance policies and Part D plans, and no matter what their business was, they are not experts in this,"" Vandre said. ""We've all spent 20-plus years working with older people in the areas of Medicare and all things health insurance.""  Harvey said that in her years of working for the county, she wasn't able to refer older people to what she believed would be the best health insurance plans available. ADRC workers are able to help seniors navigate Medicare, but cannot recommend one private insurance plan over another.  ""I'd have to say to them, 'You really have to go look in the phone book or find an agent,'"" Harvey said. ""The hard part for me was once people get past that six months of getting Medicare, they're under this false impression they can come and go out of health insurance, and you can't.""  That's because a new health insurance provider requires a health questionnaire, the results of which can be used to deny coverage.  After partnering with her colleagues, Harvey said she has the freedom to advise clients to choose an insurance plan like Physicians Mutual.  ""It's A-plus rated,"" Harvey said. ""I can't say enough about it. It's the on-going service, and we're right here. We don't take the money and run.""  Selling insurance plans may be the bread and butter of their business, but the three say they perform a lot of pro bono work because Medicare is so confusing to new retirees.  Olson's experise for the last 17 years was with Deancare Gold. However, starting in January 2016, that plan no longer will be sold. She said a new Medicare Advantage Plan will be released this fall.  Rather than work with an entirely new Medicare program through Dean, Olson decided to join Vandre and Harvey in the new endeavor.  Vandre said they strive to take the time and explain to people what it means to sign up for Medicare for the first time, and to talk about why they are such believers in Physicians Mutual for health care benefits in retirement.  ""They have quality products and amazing service,"" Vandre said. ""They're a mutual, so every policy holder is a member, like a co-op. The company puts preventative care first, and they invest in preventative care.""  Harvey said it's also affordable.  ""In the 21 years I've done this job, I have never seen an insurance company go down in rates and Physicians Mutual went down seven percent this year,"" Harvey said.

Webb's ire is centred on the fact that the plans outlined by David Gauke, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, will not be implemented until the 'mid-2020s', meaning millions of workers will still not be automatically enrolled into their employer's pension fund. These 'excluded' workers will include the low-paid, those with a number of poor paying jobs, and those under the age of 22.  A Conservative manifesto commitment to bring the self-employed into the auto-enrolment net has also been ignored, although the Government says it will look at ways in which 'technology' can be used to encourage the country's 4.8?million army of self-employed to increase their pension saving.  Some nine million workers are now saving into a pension for the first time as a result of auto-enrolment - with their payments topped up with tax relief and an employer contribution. Although they have the right to opt out, few do. The key proposals included in the auto-enrolment review will result in both more workers being drawn into pensions and employees saving more than currently.  The age below which workers are excluded from auto-enrolment will drop from 22 to 18, a move benefiting women in particular because it will give them more time to save - making good the periods they take time out of the workplace to have children or look after elderly parents.  Also, the slice of annual earnings (currently between £5,876 and £45,000) used to determine the amount of contribution that ends up in someone's works pension fund will widen with the dropping of the lower earnings limit.  The Government says these respective measures will help introduce 900,000 young people into pensions and bring an extra £2.6?billion into pension saving. Gauke says: 'We are committed to enabling more people to save while they are working so that they can enjoy greater financial security when they retire.'  The Government's decision to delay the reforms until the mid-2020s has probably been prompted by concerns over a possible backlash from businesses which will have to pay more in pension contributions as a result.

223,13241,"That will likely save construction companies money but result in more pollution — including sediment, fertilizer and construction chemicals — flowing untreated from construction sites through stormwater systems and straight into Indiana waterways.  ""These sites are gaping wounds of pollution,"" said Jill Hoffman, executive director of the White River Alliance. ""I just don't understand why we're not on the same page about this. People want to buy places that were thoughtfully developed and have a sustainable future.""  How the stormwater system works  The stormwater systems used by many cities and towns across the state contribute to the problem.  The so-called municipal separate storm sewer systems, or MS4s, are needed to whisk stormwater from urbanized areas, where impermeable pavement increases the risk of flooding. But the underground pipes also wash whatever they contact — cigarette butts, oil slicks and trash — directly into Indiana streams, rivers and lakes.  Sediment gets washed away, too, and sediment from construction sites is particularly troublesome. The degree of disturbance on the sites loosens the dirt in such a way that, with the right amount of rain and lack of prevention, sediment washes into stormwater systems at a rate 10-20 times the rate it would leave a farm field.  So the Environmental Protection Agency requires cities and towns with such systemsto develop and enforce best management practices to reduce pollutants and runoff.  The EPA and the IDEM require site plan review of construction sites where an acre of land or more will be disturbed. And some of the more than 150 Indiana communities with such stormwater systems require reviews of smaller sites.  A rule in Hamilton County, for example, requires stormwater protection plans for sites smaller than one acre as long as the site is part of a larger development. So if a subdivision is being developed lot by lot, the contractor will still have to produce plans for those smaller plots. That's because, while smaller sites might not introduce a large amount of sediment pollution into surrounding waterways, the cumulative runoff can be significant.  Developers and contractors say the varied array of rules across the state is a burden. It forces them to navigate several dozen different entities all with their own rules and processes, said Rick Wajda, chief executive officer of the Indiana Builders Association.  ""A lot of these MS4s have taken Rule5 (which governs construction runoff in Indiana) and added additional requirements that add costs,"" he said.  Rep. Doug Miller, R-Elkhart, authored the bill, but did not respond to multiple interview requests. Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Syracuse, is sponsoring the bill in the state Senate. He declined to be interviewed through a Senate press contact.  Some groups argue that home rule allows local operators to make decisions that best fit their unique waterways and landscapes, which vary greatly across the state.  ""What happens is that the locals might have a local resource they're trying to protect,"" said Lori Gates, chair of the board of directors for Indiana Association for Floodplain and Stormwater Management.  One thing many Hoosiers may not realize, Gates said, is that sediment is the main pollutant of concern from construction sites. It's the top pollutant by volume, flowing off of construction sites at a rate up to 2,000 times that of forest lands.  The sediment can carry harmful pollutants such as fertilizers, pesticides and construction chemicals, but it can also cause damage all on its own.  ""Too much sediment can suffocate the life out of our waterways,"" Gates said.  Real life example: Indian Lake  Mark Rumreich knows this issue first hand. He's been the president of the Indian Lake Improvement Association in northeast Marion County for several years. The organization consists of local residents, who pay an average of $1,000 every year to maintain the lake.  Most of that money goes toward dredging the lake, which receives runoff from a 25-square-mile watershed. Some of the sedimentation is natural, but over the years, increased development in the area has dramatically increased the amount of silt in the lake.  If Rumreich's association didn't dredge the lake, ""it would turn into a marsh or a swamp,"" he said. ""That's not what we signed up for.""  Dredging became so costly that the association bought its own dredging equipment to keep costs low. Rumreich said they began sending members out as ""watershed watchdogs"" to monitor construction sites and take photos of violations. He said that they'd try to work with developers to bring them into compliance, but in some cases they resorted to legal action.  They filed their first lawsuit in 2006 against the Indiana Department of Transportation and its subcontractors for failing to take proper erosion control measures while working on an expansion of Pendleton Pike. A soil scientist hired by the Indian Lake Improvement Association said lax erosion control measures sent 3,280 tons of sediment into the lake, forming what locals called ""INDOT Island."" A contractor quoted the cost of removing the sediment at more than $270,000.  The state ultimately settled the case for about $254,000.  A confusing system for developers  More than 150 communities in Indiana have these types of systems, each with the authority to set its own rules. Even forms and stop work processes could be different from town to town.  That causes confusion and ultimately costs Hoosier homeowners and developers, said Wajda of the Indiana Builders Association.  ""Roughly 25 percent of the cost of a house can be tied back to regulations, so that's regulations,"" he said. ""So we're cognizant of that. Certainly in Indiana and across the country there is a challenge to providing affordable housing. We want to make sure we keep Indiana at a competitive advantage.""  In addition to restricting home rule, Rep. Miller's bill would also require local entities to make decisions on construction plans within five business days. Currently, IDEM has 28 days to review similar construction plans.  The bill would require 72-hour written notice of a stop work order in the case of an alleged violation so that developers have a chance to address the issue without shutting down.  Finally, the bill would require plans to be reviewed by an individual that is a civil engineer, architect, or has been otherwise trained to oversee MS4 system.  Hoffman of the White River Alliance agreed that there is work to be done to standardize parts of the process for developers, but that restricting home rule is not the way to do it. Likewise, she said the bill's other provisions do little to address developers' concerns without taking power away from local authorities.  ""I think we can make some strides helping home builders have some expectations,"" she said, including standardizing forms and stop work processes. But there's a reason different communities have different rules. ""We can't ignore that this is a significant pollution problem,"" she said.  HB 1266 is a version of a 2018 bill that would have prohibited MS4 communities from imposing construction site erosion regulations more stringent than what is laid out in the Clean Water Act. That bill passed out of the House but died in the Senate Environmental Affairs Committee.  This year's version was passed by the House an now headed to the Senate.  IndyStar's environmental reporting project is made possible through the generous support of the nonprofit Nina Mason Pulliam Charitable Trust.","INDIANAPOLIS – A bill making its way through the statehouse would simplify regulations for developers, but critics say it's at the cost of Indiana's water quality.

225,743233,"Meanwhile, the Chicago-based credit bureau found that 33% of the almost $900 billion in outstanding student loans was held by subprime, or the riskiest, borrowers as of March 2012, up from 31% in 2007.  ""If you become subprime, it's more likely that you will not pay your debt,"" said TransUnion Vice President Ezra Becker, who oversaw the study.  The high debt loads could weigh on consumer spending and the economy, said Cristian de Ritis, a senior director with Moody's Analytics, a unit of Moody's Corp. If the defaults continue to increase, ""the taxpayer is going to be on the hook for losses,"" he added.  The federal government has taken a more active role in student lending and now makes about 93% of all loans.  Another study, released by Fitch Ratings, a unit of Fimalac SA and Hearst Corp., Wednesday, warned that the gap between college costs and what students can borrow under the federal student-loan program will continue to widen.  TransUnion performed its study at the request of credit unions, which make private student loans.  In the five years through last March, the portion of all student loans that were 90 days or more delinquent rose to 11.4% from 8.8%, while the average student- loan balance per borrower increased 30% to $23,829, TransUnion found.  For some borrowers, the burden is even greater. Kristin Jones, 24 years old, ran out of money to complete her education at Northeastern University in Boston and, with more than $60,000 in student-loan debt, is looking to finish her senior year at a cheaper school.  Ms. Jones, who works for a company that manages corporate-benefits plans, said she fell behind on her student loans after she found she couldn't afford to go back to Northeastern and her loan payments started kicking in.  ""I'll be pretty much trapped for life by these loans and the credit default,"" said Ms. Jones, who is on a repayment plan but still owes Northeastern one semester's tuition.  The TransUnion study didn't measure whether borrowers had poor credit scores at the time they took out their loans or if their credit scores dropped because of their repayment problems. Missed student-loan payments are more likely to have a big impact on the scores of borrowers with short credit histories such as recent college graduates, TransUnion said.  Another study, released Tuesday by credit-score provider Fair Isaac Corp., found that roughly 26 million consumers had two or more open student loans on their credit report in October 2012, up from about 12 million in 2005. A majority of bank risk managers expect student-loan delinquencies to continue to rise, according to Fair Isaac.  To be sure, the rise in student-loan debt is being at least partially offset by reductions in other types of debt, such as credit cards and mortgages, said Richard Fry, a senior economist with the Pew Research Center in Washington. That should make repaying student-loan debt more manageable for some families, he said.  But Dahjanay Williams, a 21-year-old junior at Wheaton College in Massachusetts, still worries that if she doesn't get a job before her loans come due, she won't be able to make regular payments and her credit will take a hit. ""That might mess up my credit history,"" said the New York City native.  Repaying debt has become more difficult in part because loan balances have grown and the interest rates on federal loans have increased as a result of a shift from variable-rate to fixed-rate loans. Most federal loans now carry interest rates of 6.8% or 7.9%, versus a rate of 2.875% on federal Stafford loans in May 2005, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the financial-aid website FinAid.org.  Jennifer France became delinquent on her loan payments once, in 2009. Now, there is a good chance she will become delinquent again, she said.  The 36-year-old public defender from Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., borrowed about $100,000 in federal loans and $30,000 in private loans to cover law school more than a decade ago. She has taken advantage of the income-based repayment option, which allows borrowers to peg their federal loan payments to a certain portion of income and lowers a borrower's monthly payment. But her income recently went up, and her monthly payment on all loans jumped from around $500 to more than $800, which might be too much for her to keep up with.  ""Maybe they shouldn't be so willing to give money to kids,"" she said, ""We all thought we'd be making $100,000 out the door.""  Stafford loans, which account for more than three-fourths of federal student loans, impose no credit standards and are capped at a total of $57,500 for undergraduates. Ruben Medrano, a 52-year-old undergraduate studying business management at Texas A&M University-San Antonio, said taking out about $26,000 in federal student loans was much easier than taking out an auto loan or a mortgage. ""The last vehicle we purchased, we spent four to five hours in the dealership,"" Mr. Medrano said. ""The student-loan process took me 30 to 45 minutes and I never had to leave my home.""

233,203905,"According to such sources as the AFL-CIO and research by the Washington Post in 2006, CEO pay has exploded upward as a multiple of average worker pay. In 1965, CEOs were paid 24 times more than their average worker; by 2004, that number had ballooned to 431 times the average worker's pay.  In the decade between the mid-1990s (the start of the recovery after the savings and loan crash) and the mid-2000s (well into the recovery after the dot-com bust), CEO pay has risen five times faster than the average wage-earning public's. In real terms (adjusting for inflation), the wages for the average worker has actually declined over the past decade.  How has this disparity in the sharing of profits and success of our publicly held corporations between C-level management and the employee base grown so wide? The answer is that these companies' boards of directors, who are entrusted with the authority to set executive compensation schemes, are to blame. Boards of directors are supposed to represent the interests of the shareholder base, but increasingly they seem to be only representing themselves and their executive teams.  The degree of nepotism and under-the-table handshaking involved in selecting these board members is unacceptable, with many boards comprising current and former CEOs and directors from other companies. In other words, many of these people are serving on each other's boards and executive teams simultaneously, a blatant conflict of interest.  For instance, among the board members at Citigroup Inc. (C) is Andrew Liveris, the CEO of Dow Chemical Co. (DOW).  With shares of Dow Chemical falling more than 70% over the past 52 weeks and nasty litigation against that company from Rohm & Haas Co. (ROH), how much time and attention can Liveris give to Citigroup's shareholders, for which they paid him about $165,000 in cash, stock and options in 2007 (as a member of the Audit and Risk Management Committee, no less)? How did a 15-member team on Citi's board manage to pay itself a total of $5 million for services rendered and approve another $70 million in payments to eight members of the executive team (which included Sir Win Bischoff in his acting role of chairman and Chuck Prince as the former CEO/chairman)?  To top it all off, the board members also approved ""retention equity awards"" (a new phenomenon popularly known as retention bonuses) in January 2008 to ""named executive officers and other members of senior management who the committee considered to have skills essential to managing Citi towards short-term and long-term recovery and performance"" in the amount of $72 million (of which over $18 million was cash) for seven lucky men and women.  One of those seven is Bischoff, who was paid $7 million of the total ""retention bonus"" payouts (of which almost $2 million was cash), which apparently only bought one year's worth of ""skills essential ... for long-term recovery,"" since he has announced his retirement from the board effective by February's end. Really, that $7 million was a long-term investment for Citi shareholders?  When the bulk of publicly held stock was concentrated in the hands of relatively few investment managers (mutual funds, pensions, insurance companies, etc.), who were investing for the general public, these boards and their teams were held accountable for gross compensation schemes, and they certainly weren't brash enough to put extravagant retention bonus payouts to a shareholder vote.  With the rise of the online brokerage platform, the general public has now been able to purchase and hold these stock shares in small personal batches, which has resulted in a highly fragmented and unorganized shareholder base, most of whom don't vote their shares at all. This has left boards emboldened to the point that they have the nerve to publicly rebuke ""activist investors"" who question their authority and business decisions, sometimes issuing public statements through the press.  The real issue here is that the very fact that the president of the United States has now been required to step in to assume the compensation restriction role is more a reflection on the inadequacies of U.S. corporate boards of directors than the actual executives themselves. Let none of us forget that these executives do not set their own paychecks, but rather, they work within the boundaries set by the boards.  Until boards' interests are realigned with shareholders', the level of trust needed by the general public to reinvest in the stock market will not return. If the general public is being squeezed at work by low/stagnant wages and increasing disparity in the sharing of company profits and success and being squeezed and used from an ownership perspective on their investments, where can they find relief, justice and the ability to get ahead?

If the general public is being squeezed at work by low/stagnant wages and increasing disparity in the sharing of company profits and success and being squeezed and used from an ownership perspective on their investments, where can they find relief, justice and the ability to get ahead? Until things meaningfully change, why should people trust Corporate America in any facet of their lives?

234,948364,"Powell said there are websites available that can estimate how much money you'll need by plugging in the name of the school and the year the child will be attending. A word of caution, however, about how high that figure could be.  ""I was talking to some grandparents about it and they said their grandkids wanted to go to Clemson because they live in South Carolina,"" said Powell. ""We looked at the cost and they said, 'There's no way.' I said, 'Yes, there is, because we've always had inflation.""  If people start early, Powell said one of the best tools is a college 529 plan, which allows you to put the money in the child's name and withdraw it tax free when the time comes.  If, for whatever reason, the child doesn't need the money for college, the plan can be put in another child's name with no penalty. Also, if the child is in college, the money doesn't have to go toward tuition. It can also be used for any other expenses associated with college.  For people who haven't started saving early for their children's college education and find it looming in front of them, Powell said it would be a mistake to borrow from a retirement account to pay for college, regardless of how attractive that may look at the time.  ""That's a bad idea for two reasons,"" he said. ""You have to pay taxes on it. And, if you're under 59 and a half, you have to pay an extra 10 percent penalty. You end up only getting about 75 cents for every dollar.""  There's another reason why Powell advises against that. You can borrow money for college. You can't borrow money for retirement.  Taking out of the retirement fund to pay for college could change your retirement plans by forcing you to work longer or by changing your standard of living in your retirement.  With the cost of a college education, one would think that most people would try to plan for it.  ""You'd be surprised at the number of people who don't,"" said Powell. ""A young person doesn't think 18 years is ever going to get here and they think they have plenty of time. It's like buying insurance for assisted living. We know we need to do it, but we put it off.""  For people who find themselves unprepared for the cost of college, there are some other options, said Lori Herrick, Director of Financial Aid at McMurry University.  ""How a student does in high school is important, not just their GPA, but extra curriculars and community service. They need to begin looking at scholarships that are available to them aggressively during their senior year.""  There are other ways that students can defray the cost of their college education. One is by taking dual credit courses while in high school. However, Herrick offered a caveat to that plan.  ""One thing to understand is that the child is going to be in an upper-level class and is still just 18 years old,"" she said. ""If they can handle that, dual credit is a great idea.""  Another option is for a student to attend a junior college for the first year to get those courses out of the way without incurring a huge debt.  A student also needs to be prepared to get through college in four years by taking advantage of block tuition, which most colleges charge.  Under block tuition, said Herrick, 12 hours cost as much as 18 hours.  ""We want students to be successful,"" said Herrick.","When it comes to paying for your children's college, the best advice is to start saving early and often.

236,739970,"According to Christine Benz, personal finance director at Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based investment research firm, having an investment plan is the best way to protect yourself from “making sure you're not just responding to what's happening in the market today or this week.” She says it's astonishing to see the huge number of investors who, nervous by volatility in the markets, “suddenly just uproot parts of their portfolio in an effort to keep their money safe.”  These investors, she says, choose to find safety in money market accounts or even by holding cash, but that security comes at a cost: Returns can be so low that it's even hard to out-earn inflation.  That's particularly concerning because inflation is rising – Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said this week that the central bank expects inflation to rise above 4 per cent early next year. It means that you need to make even greater returns to cover inflation. Say you're investing in a mutual fund with fees of 2 per cent – you'll need a return of 6 per cent before you start to make any profit.  The other place where panicked investors generally move their money, Ms. Benz says, is “to whatever has been working recently.” Right now in Canada, that would be energy or commodity stocks. The problem is that by the time investors decide to pull out of other investments and buy these “hot” stocks, share prices are near their highs and there's little profit left to be made.  Ms. Benz says age is the most crucial consideration in drawing up an asset allocation plan and deciding how you're going to invest. How close are you to retirement and needing that money? If you have a long time frame, say 10 years or more, invest more heavily in stocks “because that's probably your best shot at out-earning inflation,” she says. It also means that you can ride out any volatility.  Ms. Benz also points out that investors are most secure when their portfolios are diversified. If you're investing in stocks, include some that pay dividends. They may seem old-fashioned, she says, but investing in some dividend-paying stocks in a company with a history of raising them “can be a very attractive place to be.”  But diversification goes beyond just the kind of stocks you hold. To achieve real diversification, Ms. Benz suggests that investors look beyond their borders and their home-country biases and think globally. If markets are volatile in North America, have some of your money invested in areas of the world that are faring better. Or think about investing in an emerging market where the growth rate is forecast to be much higher than Canada's 1 per cent for 2008.  To feel perfectly safe in volatile times, Ms. Benz also believes in having an emergency fund. Financial planners always advise clients to keep a bank account with three to six months of living expenses at the ready in case something goes wrong, like you lose your job or get sick, but how many of us really do it? I don't know anyone who does, even among my most financially attuned friends.  But Ms. Benz says such a fund not only gives you the security of having a safety net, but allows you to avoid tapping into your retirement funds or borrowing on high-cost credit to make ends meet should something go wrong.  These are all great tips, but I also take comfort in knowing that although the markets are volatile, we've been here before. In fact, in my second Investor's Diary on Jan. 26, I wrote of the unsettling plunge in the markets that saw the TSX lose 6.6 per cent of its value in five days a week before, and then fall another 605 points the following Monday.  My conclusion then: I was too nervous to make any move. Well, that was then, this is now.

237,1395898,"Retirement savings plan  Open enrollment is a prime time to consider boosting your retirement plan contributions and assess your investment choices. In 2016, individuals under 50 years old can contribute $18,000 to their 401(k) or 403(b) plan in 2016, while those ages 50 and older can contribute $24,000. You may also want to consider a Roth 401(k) or 403(b) as a way to build up retirement savings that may qualify to be withdrawn on a tax-free basis when you retire. It's important to note that the 2017 limits for both health care flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and retirement savings plans are indexed to inflation and have not been set yet (as of Sept. 14).  Health benefits  Insurance coverage is a top priority for most of us. Think about your own health and what your anticipated medical needs might be in the coming year and pick an appropriate plan. You might want to choose a plan with lower deductibles if you expect to address specific medical issues. A high deductible option may be best if you don't anticipate any major medical issues (although we never know when such problems may occur). If you go the high deductible route, consider a Health Savings Account (HSA). It allows you to set money aside on a pre-tax basis that can be used to meet current eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses, but can also be invested to grow and help pay future medical costs.  Flexible spending accounts (FSAs)  Your employer may offer the ability to use pre-tax dollars to fund spending accounts to help pay for medical and child care expenses. In effect, this reduces your out-of-pocket expenses in each area. There are limits to the amount you can put toward a health care and dependent care FSA each year; the dependent care limit depends on your marital status and age of your children. Check the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website so you know what your limit is.  Life insurance  If you have family members who rely on you for financial support, life insurance should be a priority. Life insurance helps protect the lifestyle and future goals of your loved ones in the event something happens to you. There are many factors that determine the amount of coverage you need. To start, look at your annual income, outstanding mortgage, future amount you intend to put toward retirement, estate taxes, uninsured medical expenses and funeral costs.  Disability and long-term care insurance  Many employers also offer disability income coverage. This is a valuable benefit to provide an income stream if an accident, injury or illness prevents you from working for an extended period.  Any option to purchase additional coverage is worth considering to have more complete protection. Some employers also offer the opportunity to purchase long-term care coverage with a group discount. Compare the costs with coverage you can purchase on your own to determine where you will get the best value.  Open enrollment season is a good time to talk to your employer's benefits administrator if you have questions about your options. It also makes sense to consult with your financial adviser for perspective on how your benefits fit with your overall financial plan.  —Timothy LePain of Natick is a financial adviser with Ameriprise Financial Services Inc., member FINRA and SIPC, in Natick.

238,377583," ""It is a loaded psychological issue,"" says Sharon Rich, a Belmont, Mass., financial planner. ""You are dealing with two of our culture's three big taboos -- death and money.""    Nonetheless, children who don't take that step may get a rude awakening. They may find themselves scavenging for wills, insurance policies and bank statements after their parents die. Or worse, they may find that they lack the basic tools to protect their parents' interests if they become seriously ill or incompetent.    A good first step is to put yourself in your parents' shoes, says Karen Spero, a Cleveland-based financial planner. That means recognizing that what is best for the parent isn't always best for the child. ""You must try to understand what the parent fears and what it really costs the parent to live,"" she says.    One real fear is often that the children want the money for themselves. ""Everyone is afraid of outliving their money,"" says Ms. Spero. ""In their concern about not having enough, they become somewhat suspicious about other people.""    Take that into consideration and it may be easier to move on to the four things financial and legal advisers generally agree children and their aging parents should address: a will, a durable power of attorney, a health-care proxy and a list of assets.    Alexander Bove Jr., a Boston estate attorney, says preparing a durable power of attorney is the most important step. The document, which should be drafted with the help of a good lawyer, would allow a child to do such things as sign tax returns, transfer assets into a trust and make financial decisions for a parent if he or she should become incompetent. If worded properly, it could even allow a child to establish trusts and make gifts for a parent, Mr. Bove says.    ""I would actually do the power of attorney before the will,"" he says, noting that a will is of no help whatsoever in dealing with the problems that can arise if parents become unable to conduct their own affairs, possibly years before they die.    Many parents don't want to give such power too soon for fear the kids will abuse it, spending the money or making foolish decisions. One solution, says Mr. Bove, is to execute the durable power of attorney, but leave it with a lawyer to be delivered to the child when necessary.    But a durable power of attorney doesn't replace a will. For one thing, its power lapses upon death. And in the absence of a will, or the appropriate trusts, the state will impose its own formula on distribution of the estate.    In a second marriage, for instance, that means that the new spouse could get some of the share intended for the children. ""In a case like that, for sure, we don't want to downplay the importance of a will,"" says Mr. Bove.    The third critical item is a health-care proxy. With this document, the parent would delegate the right to make health-care decisions, such as whether to undergo an operation. Rules vary from state to state, but often a living will is incorporated into the document, outlining specifically what measures would be acceptable to prolong life.    While on the topic of health care, children may also want to tackle funeral arrangements. ""This may be harder for the kids to deal with than the parents,"" says Ms. Spero. But it is important to find out if the parents have already bought burial plots or made arrangements with a specific funeral home.    The fourth area is the list of assets and where they can be found. That means listing not only bank accounts and stock certificates, but also pension plans, insurance policies and individual retirement accounts. Don't forget things like money due, such as a loan made to a sister but never openly discussed. Even the mortgage coupon book should be on the list.    Parents may not like telling all to their children. But consider the alternative of trying to reconstruct an estate with no guidelines. ""It can really be a nightmare and often is,"" says Max Gutierrez, a partner at the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco.    He tells of children finding stock certificates in the attic years after their parents' deaths. In one case, missing jewelry ""had people eyeing one another suspiciously"" until it was eventually found behind a loose board in a closet.

The Talk You Must Have With Your Parents


Your parents are getting on in years. To some people, that means
they may soon come into their inheritance. But most people are more
concerned that what they will get are their parents' problems and
bills, or even the parents themselves.



Advisers say it is never too soon for adult children to start
talking with their parents about the ""what ifs,"" planning for what
could happen. But with the children trying to avoid looking greedy
and parents not wanting to give up control, broaching the subject
can be an emotional minefield.

 ""It is a loaded psychological issue,"" says Sharon Rich, a Belmont, Mass., financial planner. ""You are dealing with two of our culture's three big taboos -- death and money.""    Nonetheless, children who don't take that step may get a rude awakening. They may find themselves scavenging for wills, insurance policies and bank statements after their parents die. Or worse, they may find that they lack the basic tools to protect their parents' interests if they become seriously ill or incompetent.    A good first step is to put yourself in your parents' shoes, says Karen Spero, a Cleveland-based financial planner. That means recognizing that what is best for the parent isn't always best for the child. ""You must try to understand what the parent fears and what it really costs the parent to live,"" she says.    One real fear is often that the children want the money for themselves. ""Everyone is afraid of outliving their money,"" says Ms. Spero. ""In their concern about not having enough, they become somewhat suspicious about other people.""    Take that into consideration and it may be easier to move on to the four things financial and legal advisers generally agree children and their aging parents should address: a will, a durable power of attorney, a health-care proxy and a list of assets.    Alexander Bove Jr., a Boston estate attorney, says preparing a durable power of attorney is the most important step. The document, which should be drafted with the help of a good lawyer, would allow a child to do such things as sign tax returns, transfer assets into a trust and make financial decisions for a parent if he or she should become incompetent. If worded properly, it could even allow a child to establish trusts and make gifts for a parent, Mr. Bove says.    ""I would actually do the power of attorney before the will,"" he says, noting that a will is of no help whatsoever in dealing with the problems that can arise if parents become unable to conduct their own affairs, possibly years before they die.    Many parents don't want to give such power too soon for fear the kids will abuse it, spending the money or making foolish decisions. One solution, says Mr. Bove, is to execute the durable power of attorney, but leave it with a lawyer to be delivered to the child when necessary.    But a durable power of attorney doesn't replace a will. For one thing, its power lapses upon death. And in the absence of a will, or the appropriate trusts, the state will impose its own formula on distribution of the estate.    In a second marriage, for instance, that means that the new spouse could get some of the share intended for the children. ""In a case like that, for sure, we don't want to downplay the importance of a will,"" says Mr. Bove.    The third critical item is a health-care proxy. With this document, the parent would delegate the right to make health-care decisions, such as whether to undergo an operation. Rules vary from state to state, but often a living will is incorporated into the document, outlining specifically what measures would be acceptable to prolong life.    While on the topic of health care, children may also want to tackle funeral arrangements. ""This may be harder for the kids to deal with than the parents,"" says Ms. Spero. But it is important to find out if the parents have already bought burial plots or made arrangements with a specific funeral home.    The fourth area is the list of assets and where they can be found. That means listing not only bank accounts and stock certificates, but also pension plans, insurance policies and individual retirement accounts. Don't forget things like money due, such as a loan made to a sister but never openly discussed. Even the mortgage coupon book should be on the list.    Parents may not like telling all to their children. But consider the alternative of trying to reconstruct an estate with no guidelines. ""It can really be a nightmare and often is,"" says Max Gutierrez, a partner at the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco.    He tells of children finding stock certificates in the attic years after their parents' deaths. In one case, missing jewelry ""had people eyeing one another suspiciously"" until it was eventually found behind a loose board in a closet. And in at least one case, the children were trying to reconstruct the assets from the parents' tax returns -- ""only to find that they hadn't filed taxes for years,"" he says.    When making the list, it's a good idea to record the date of purchase and the purchase price. This provides a basis price for tax purposes in case assets have to be sold as the parents get older. Also remember that some assets, like brokerage accounts, may require special powers of attorney, since some financial institutions don't honor a durable power of attorney.    Having tackled the basics, children may find it easier to begin discussing financial planning with their parents. Sometimes, the most important financial assistance given an aging parent may be as simple as helping to open the mail and pay the bills. Or it may require some reallocation of assets.    But children must be careful not to trample their parents' security in a search for higher yield, warns Ms. Spero. Money socked away in 3% certificates of deposit, for example, may seem a less-than-optimum investment today, but that doesn't mean the child should push to put that money into a riskier, higher-yielding investment.    ""You can't disrupt someone that much,"" she says, noting that the CDs may make the parent feel secure.

240,1454583,"Earlier this year, city officials had estimated that building a utility billing center across the street from Grand Island City Hall would cost about $400,000 to $500,000. But as design layout began, the cost estimates soared to $600,000 to $900,000.  ""It became more expensive than we anticipated,"" said interim Finance Director Billy Clingman.  ""It's cost prohibitive,"" said Grand Island Building Department Director Craig Lewis.  So instead of a 3,000-square-foot stand-alone building for utility billing, Utilities Director Tim Luchsinger said city staff looked at using 2,000 square feet of unused space at the Utilities Engineering Building at 1306 W. Third St. The Utilities Department bought it from the city early last year.  Luchsinger said the department had planned to ""grow into the building over 10 years,"" but now may take it all over within about 10 months with a growing trend of utility customers wanting to pay in cash.  That phenomenon brings in as many as 300 customers a day to City Hall, which has a cramped utility payment window and just a dozen parking stalls.  Luchsinger and Clingman said the city can be better at customer service.  Luchsinger told the council that the Utilities Engineering Division can be remodeled for $104,500 to create a utility billing center. It will have 25 parking stalls, three cashier windows and two customer service desks to assist customers who need to start/end/transfer utility service or set up a payment plan. There is also room for division supervisors, billing staff and meter readers. The city wouldn't have to build bathrooms, conference rooms, breakrooms and a mechanical room, which the existing building already has.  For an additional $35,000, an overhead tube system could be added to function as a drive-through drop-off, Luchsinger said. A recent survey of utility customers found that 85 percent favored having drive-through access for bill paying.  The main setbacks in using the existing building are that access to its west side, where the payment center would be located, is a gravel street, and the building itself is not a known destination location, so signage and public education upfront would be key, he said.  Councilman Chuck Haase said he worried about dividing up the Finance Department staff — the portion that handles utility billing and the portion that handles budgeting, other accounts receivable and vendor payments — at a time when the city lacks a permanent finance director. Haase said the finance director should have some say as to where finance staff are located because it affects management and oversight.  Councilwoman Julie Hehnke called the remodeling alternative ""spot on"" regarding cost.  Councilman Mitch Nickerson also liked the alternative location because the proposal shows the Utility Department has buy-in to a solution for its customer service problem. He liked that the Utilities Department was willing to give up part of its own building to find a better way to serve customers.  Nickerson also favored moving the billing staff to the Engineering Division building because it would free up space at City Hall, 100 E. First, for two other space-strapped departments — Human Resources and Information Technology — and it would right-size the Finance Department.  Council President Linna Dee Donaldson said the move would make private space for utility customers working out payment plans and private space for Human Resources staff interviewing city job candidates or working out benefit details with existing city staff. Providing private space for such confidential matters is important to customers and employees, she said.  Councilman Mike Paulick said the only challenge he saw ahead was dealing with rainwater that pools in the west parking lot at the Engineering Division building — an area that lacks storm drains — but he favored the move anyway.  Mayor Jeremy Jensen called the remodeling proposal a ""viable alternative"" presented by a city team aimed at problem solving.  The council meeting was a study session, so no formal decision was made on the utility billing center. It's expected to come back at a future council meeting for a vote.  City Administrator Marlan Ferguson said if the center is created, revenues from utility ratepayers will be used to remodel the Engineering Division building for the billing center, while city taxpayer money will be used for any remodel of space freed up at City Hall.","The Grand Island City Council members like a proposal to use unused space in an existing Grand Island Utilities building instead of constructing a brand new, separate building as a utility billing center.

Around 2.2million of the coins were minted in 2011 and released into circulation but an earlier version of the coin was minted in 2009 and is much more valuable.  Far fewer were made – just under 20,000 – making them much rarer and worth far more.  At the time the 2009 Blue Peter coins were made, they could be bought from the Royal Mint for £1.99 and they were never officially put into circulation.  Is your small change worth a fortune?  IF you think that you might have a rare coin then you might be able to make a real mint.  The most valuable coins are usually those with a low mintage or an error.  These are often deemed the most valuable by collectors.  You should check how much the coin is selling for on eBay.  Search the full name of the coin, select the “sold” listing and then toggle the search to “highest value”.  It will give you an idea of the amount of money that the coin is going for.  You can either choose to sell the coin on eBay or through a specialist such as ChangeChecker.org.  If you choose the auction website then remember to set a minimum price that is higher or at the very least equal to the face value of the coin.  Even if your coin “sells” on eBay for a high price there’s no guarantee that the buyer will cough up.  It its terms and conditions, the auction website states that bidders enter a “legally binding contract to purchase an item”, but there’s no way to enforce this rule in reality.  The most eBay can do is add a note to their account for the unpaid item or remove their ability to bid and buy.  But they have likely slipped into people’s pockets since and have been bought and sold too.  Now one of these coins has been spotted on eBay selling for £205, many times its face value and original price.  Though there’s no way to be 100% sure that the coin actually changed hands for this amount, the seller has positive reviews and a long-standing history on the platform.  Previously the coin has been estimated to be worth £100 and it has previously sold for £148 on eBay.  The value of a coin can depend on how much someone is willing to pay for it – for instance a collector may be willing to pay more if it completes a collection.  The latest sale did not include packaging and any coin in the original wrapping tends to sell for more than those without.  The 2011 version is valued at just £1.73 according to Coinhunter.

243,785280,"As Social Security Declines, Americans Seek New Solutions  As it currently stands, Social Security is set to run out of funds for full payments by 2034, a year earlier than previously anticipated. With retirement looming closer for some demographics, it's unsurprising that Americans are exploring options to secure their financial futures outside of government-funded ventures.  Rocket Dollar's study highlights the subsequent rise in interest surrounding alternative investments in response to this growing need for diversification. One particularly interesting data point revealed through the study shows that 63% of Americans said their lack of trust in Social Security stands as the leading motivator for having retirement accounts.  The gender breakdown suggests motivators are rooted deeply in individual concerns for financial stability and protection. While men are significantly more motivated than women to have a retirement account in order to reduce their taxable income and have tax-free growth in the future, women are reported to be significantly more motivated due to the uncertainty surrounding the receipt of Social Security benefits and the ability to create a legacy for their futures and the futures of their families.  A Growing Interest in Alternative Investments  Knowing the importance of diversification for long-term investing, especially when it comes to retirement, 74% of Americans want the option to diversify their retirement account to the investments of their choosing, including alternative investments. Across millennials, Gen X and boomers, 53% of all respondents are interested in learning how they can use a retirement account to invest in alternative investments, with younger millennials being the most enthusiastic about the topic.  General awareness of specific types of alternatives varied by generation. Baby boomers were noticeably more aware of investment options such as real estate (67%), precious metals (64%), collectibles (58%), and commodities (48%), compared to younger millennials with regard to real estate (41%), precious metals (31%), collectibles (29%), and commodities (24%). Cryptocurrency had the smallest awareness gap across generations, with 46% of younger millennials reporting familiarity compared to 51% of older millennials, and 55% of baby boomers.  Welcoming a New Era of Investors  Overall, the generational interest in investing in alternative assets using retirement accounts suggests a new age of investors is emerging, with 69% of younger millennials reporting marked interest, followed by 63% of older millennials and 55% of Gen X participants. While 45% of the participants currently invest in at least one type of alternative investment, regardless of age, men reported a substantially higher interest in alternative investments with over 51% of male participants investing currently, compared to 39% of women. The study also revealed the fact that cryptocurrency has become the most popular alternative asset across the board, with 15% of Americans now currently investing in crypto, surpassing collectibles (10%), precious metals (9%), and real estate (8%).  ""As the insecurity of social security becomes more apparent, we are seeing more Americans seeking financial security elsewhere. Every generation of adult Americans believe having a retirement account and being able to contribute to it is important for one's legacy,"" said Henry Yoshida, CEO of Rocket Dollar. ""This study makes it clear that the public is now looking to utilize their retirement accounts to invest in alternative assets as a way to diversify their retirement savings.

The health sector came under scrutiny, with the report questioning its governance system and calling for more private sector involvement to spur competition.

247,993089,"Even several rural senators, who complained loudly that rising property taxes are crippling the state's No. 1 industry, agriculture, conceded that there's no solution in sight this year.  ""The body is just all over the board on this issue,"" said State Sen. Mark Kolterman of Seward.  But the senator who is chairwoman of the Legislature's Education Committee, Kate Sullivan of Cedar Rapids, pledged that a post-2015 session study will seek to finally find a solution.  ""We've heard the message loud and clear from citizens that something needs to be done,"" Sullivan said. ""Our charge will be to figure it out.""  So what's the answer?  ""In the simplest form, it's additional state support for education,"" the senator said, which would most likely mean shifting the load onto state sales or income taxes to allow for cuts in local property taxes.  ""The question,"" Sullivan added, ""is do we have the political will to do it, and if we do, how do we do it?""  The debate came as senators discussed two much more minor tax breaks on Tuesday. One was a sales tax exemption that would help the state's zoos, including Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium. The other was an $800,000 property tax exemption to help persuade Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society to keep its headquarters in Omaha.

Dave Bloomfield, displayed the property tax bills from his home place, a 295-acre farm, showing a 300 percent increase from 2005 to 2014, $5,099 to $15,259.  Bloomfield joined other rural senators in pleading for property tax relief as farmers face break-even years because of another double-digit increase in property taxes next year amid low crop prices.  ""It doesn't matter if you don't make any money farming, you pay the (property) tax,"" he said.  Entering the 2015 session, new Gov.

LINCOLN — State senators engaged in the Great Property Tax Relief Debate of the 2015 session on Tuesday.

But instead of action this year, lawmakers appear ready to settle for another study of how to reverse Nebraska's long history as a high property tax state.
Even several rural senators, who complained loudly that rising property taxes are crippling the state's No. 1 industry, agriculture, conceded that there's no solution in sight this year.  ""The body is just all over the board on this issue,"" said State Sen. Mark Kolterman of Seward.  But the senator who is chairwoman of the Legislature's Education Committee, Kate Sullivan of Cedar Rapids, pledged that a post-2015 session study will seek to finally find a solution.  ""We've heard the message loud and clear from citizens that something needs to be done,"" Sullivan said. ""Our charge will be to figure it out.""  So what's the answer?  ""In the simplest form, it's additional state support for education,"" the senator said, which would most likely mean shifting the load onto state sales or income taxes to allow for cuts in local property taxes.  ""The question,"" Sullivan added, ""is do we have the political will to do it, and if we do, how do we do it?""  The debate came as senators discussed two much more minor tax breaks on Tuesday. One was a sales tax exemption that would help the state's zoos, including Omaha's Henry Doorly Zoo & Aquarium. The other was an $800,000 property tax exemption to help persuade Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society to keep its headquarters in Omaha.  Lawmakers advanced the zoo tax break on a voice vote to final-round consideration but adjourned before a similar vote could be taken on the Woodmen bill.  A motion to pull it off the agenda was defeated on a 30-13 vote, so it appears that Legislative Bill 414 has enough support to advance.

248,1188169," Despite the increase in boating traffic, the primary factor wasn’t collisions, but more often, the victim fell overboard or the boat capsized, the DNR said. Alcohol, excessive speed or weather conditions were all contributing factors. October was the deadliest month, with five people killed while boating on state lakes. Besides those incidents, the number of nonfatal boating accidents also went up in 2015 over previous years, at 76 accidents compared with 36 in 2014 and 65 in 2013. However, citations for boating while intoxicated (BWI) stayed relatively flat, with 80 BWIs compared to 76 BWIs in 2014 and 89 in 2013, the DNR said. Lt. Jackie Glaser, who supervises conservation officers who patrol the west metro, including Prior Lake, Lake Minnetonka and the Mississippi River, said the numbers indicate that people are more prepared to designate a sober boat driver. But she said they also indicate that boaters need to take more precautions such as wearing life jackets. “We never see enough people wearing life jackets,” added Lt. Adam Block, who supervises conservation officers who patrol the east metro including the St. Croix River. “It’s going to save a life.” Busy boating season After 2014 brought boating to a standstill with record rainfall in the Twin Cities, unprecedented flooding and no-wake restrictions, Minnesota’s estimated 2.3 million boaters rejoiced when 2015 ushered in the opposite conditions: an early ice-out and warm weather throughout the year. On Lake Minnetonka, the Twin Cities’ largest lake, the conservation district that manages use of the lake stepped up enforcement this year. It paid for a dedicated patrol officer for the first time and a new satellite station on the 14,000-acre lake. Even with those preparations, the Fourth of July weekend found first responders inundated with 75 calls as thousands of boaters swarmed the lake. “In my almost 15 years it’s probably the busiest summer on the water,” Glaser said. “I’ve never seen it so busy on Lake Minnetonka on the Fourth of July in my life. It was the most wild I’ve seen it.” Boating traffic remained high throughout the longer boating season, she added, but the call volume on other weekends remained closer to average, with few accidents or major incidents. Authorities responded to a couple of serious medical calls, but only one boating-related death on the massive lake, a 7-year-old girl who died of carbon monoxide poisoning in October. ‘Not the direction we want’ While boating fatalities have reached a 10-year high, the long-term trend for boating fatalities is still down in Minnesota over past decades. In the 1960s and 1970s, when the DNR first started keeping count, boating deaths neared 60 deaths a year some years, but fell steadily over the next few decades as education and enforcement ramped up. In 2002, there were 30 fatalities, before falling the next two years. The death toll went back up to 23 deaths in 2005 before declining again. Now, the rise in fatalities is “not the direction we want to go,” Linnell said. “We’ve had a nice run of lower numbers that we’d like to get back to.” Kelly Smith • 612-673-4141 BOATING FATALITIES Minnesota boating fatalities have reached the highest level in a decade.

251,782753,"A May 2008 spinoff from Cadbury, the company turned independent as the U.S. slid into a recession. But that independence also helped it reinvest more of its profits into its own brands, the company says, launching such products as Dr Pepper Cherry and boosting marketing.  ""Previously much of our profits were shipped across the pond to help a candy outlet that was based there,"" Chief Executive Larry Young quipped at the Beverage Digest conference this week.  As a subsidiary, Dr Pepper Snapple saw its marketing budget drop for several years, but since its independence it has been boosting its ad spending, said marketing chief Jim Trebilcock in an interview. The company, for instance, relaunched advertising for Canada Dry for the first time after nearly a decade this year, he said, a move that helped drive higher volumes for the brand this year.  With a market capitalization of roughly $7 billion, Dr Pepper Snapple is much smaller than competitor Coca-Cola's $135 billion and PepsiCo's $94 billion. In 2008, the most recent full year of data from trade publication Beverage Digest, Dr Pepper Snapple's market share of the U.S. carbonated soft drinks market rose 0.3 percentage point to 15.3%, even as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo saw slight share declines to about 42.7% and 30.8%, respectively.  Dr Pepper Snapple trades at about 14 times expected 2009 earnings, still relatively cheaper than Coca-Cola's 19 times and PepsiCo's 16 times.  At the heart of Dr Pepper Snapple's market-share gains has been the popularity of its flavored carbonated drinks like Dr Pepper, which have held up better than the overall soft drink market.  ""Their volumes look very good compared to the rest of the industry,"" says Esther Kwon, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. ""The flavored drinks haven't been declining as much.""  The beverage company has its share of challenges. Sales of its premium, and key, Snapple brand have been under pressure as consumers have slashed spending. In an effort to boost that brand the company is trying new Snapple offerings like a cheaper version that sells in a can for 79 cents.  Now, a new deal with PepsiCo for distribution of such brands as Crush, will play a key role in the company's sales. Under the deal, announced last week, PepsiCo will pay Dr Pepper $900 million to license some soft drinks like Crush in the U.S. To be sure, even the $900 million payment fell short of what some analysts had been expecting PepsiCo to shell out. But the agreement helped remove uncertainty about the distribution of those brands. Trebilcock said the company believes the payment was a fair one.  ConsumerEdge Research analyst Bill Pecoriello says the deal will help the company reduce its debt and ultimately its interest expense. Pecoriello has a $34 price target on the stock, which was recently trading at $27.86.  Dr Pepper's former parent, Cadbury, is fighting off a hostile acquisition bid from Kraft Foods Inc. (KFT) and the beverage company's own size could make it a potential candidate for a deal. The beverage maker was spun off after efforts to sell it stalled as credit dried up globally. And the list of potential acquirers that might be interested in buying the company outright isn't large at the moment. Coca-Cola and PepsiCo would likely face antitrust issues if they tried to buy the smaller company outright, and private-equity players are still staying on the sidelines.  In a statement, Dr Pepper didn't comment directly on the possibility of being an acquisition target, saying only that it is pleased with its performance in its first full year as a standalone company, and that it plans to keep delivering shareholder value.

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--More than a year into its separation from Cabdury PLC (CBY), soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc. (DPS) is coming into its own.

The maker of the eponymous soda has gained market share in the carbonated soft drink industry even as overall soft drink sales have fallen. It issued its first dividend recently and entered into a long-awaited distribution agreement with PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) last week. The market-share gains along with improved profit margins have helped push the stock up about 70% this year outshining Coca-Cola Co.'s (KO) 26% gain and PepsiCo's jump of 8%.
A May 2008 spinoff from Cadbury, the company turned independent as the U.S. slid into a recession. But that independence also helped it reinvest more of its profits into its own brands, the company says, launching such products as Dr Pepper Cherry and boosting marketing.  ""Previously much of our profits were shipped across the pond to help a candy outlet that was based there,"" Chief Executive Larry Young quipped at the Beverage Digest conference this week.  As a subsidiary, Dr Pepper Snapple saw its marketing budget drop for several years, but since its independence it has been boosting its ad spending, said marketing chief Jim Trebilcock in an interview. The company, for instance, relaunched advertising for Canada Dry for the first time after nearly a decade this year, he said, a move that helped drive higher volumes for the brand this year.  With a market capitalization of roughly $7 billion, Dr Pepper Snapple is much smaller than competitor Coca-Cola's $135 billion and PepsiCo's $94 billion. In 2008, the most recent full year of data from trade publication Beverage Digest, Dr Pepper Snapple's market share of the U.S. carbonated soft drinks market rose 0.3 percentage point to 15.3%, even as Coca-Cola and PepsiCo saw slight share declines to about 42.7% and 30.8%, respectively.  Dr Pepper Snapple trades at about 14 times expected 2009 earnings, still relatively cheaper than Coca-Cola's 19 times and PepsiCo's 16 times.  At the heart of Dr Pepper Snapple's market-share gains has been the popularity of its flavored carbonated drinks like Dr Pepper, which have held up better than the overall soft drink market.  ""Their volumes look very good compared to the rest of the industry,"" says Esther Kwon, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. ""The flavored drinks haven't been declining as much.""  The beverage company has its share of challenges. Sales of its premium, and key, Snapple brand have been under pressure as consumers have slashed spending. In an effort to boost that brand the company is trying new Snapple offerings like a cheaper version that sells in a can for 79 cents.  Now, a new deal with PepsiCo for distribution of such brands as Crush, will play a key role in the company's sales.

253,446493,"""This Budget will give some form of tax break for superannuation - a very retrograde step in my view,"" Mr Littlewood said.    The tax breaks may be quite small, perhaps costing the Government in the low hundreds of millions of dollars a year, based on earlier Treasury studies, and worth a few hundred dollars at most for individuals.    At the start of 2002, Finance Minister Michael Cullen said the Government was ""still exploring"" realistic incentives for employment-based super schemes. He ruled out ""big structural changes"" such as lowering the tax rate on super fund contributions ""this term"", which ended in the middle of that year.    Treasury estimated that such a change would cost from $50 million to $171 million a year, depending on how it was designed. That money was not available in the 2002 Budget, Dr Cullen said. This year's Budget is expected to show a $6 billion surplus.    Treasury officials said in 2002 that any incentive scheme should involve tax ""rebates"" and a cap on contributions at between $1000 and $2000, which would qualify for a lower tax rate.    PricewaterhouseCoopers chairman and tax adviser John Shewan said Budget tax incentives for super savings were ""highly unlikely"".    Incentives had been discredited because they benefited the well-off at the expense of poorer taxpayers and did little to increase overall savings rates.    There may be some moves to appoint a group to review workplace savings schemes and design a savings plan that was easier for employers to use than present schemes.    There was some pressure to reduce the ""disincentives"" to save, such as taxing super funds at 33 per cent when some contributors were paying a personal tax rate of only 19 per cent, but that would take another couple of years to resolve, Mr Shewan said.    Investment Savings and Insurance Association chief executive Vance Arkinstall said it had ""no definite advice"" on tax incentives for retirement savings in the Budget. But some form of ""tax encouragement"" was long overdue, and he would not be surprised at an announcement.    The association favoured tax-free contributions to a ""qualifying savings plan"", with some form of lock-in period till retirement, and a cap on tax-free contributions.    ""Dr Cullen has for a long time been interested in increasing the personal savings rate and shown some interest in some form of tax encouragement, targeted at the middle income people,"" he said.    Mr Littlewood, too, said that Dr Cullen had previously indicated support for modest tax incentives for super savings.    ""Tax incentives are an attractive policy option to woo the middle class vote and Labour has issues in the polls,"" he said.    The Workplace Savings Group design of a government ""approved product"" along the lines of a ""stakeholder pension"" scheme in Britain, would be created only if there was a carrot for people to invest their money. The British scheme meant all firms with more than five staff had to choose a simplified savings product with an approved fee structure. The schemes qualify for ""huge tax incentives"".

255,734130," There are important differences and distinctions that set LTCFs apart from other health care facilities such as hospitals. First and foremost, LTCFs are the patient`s ``home.`` Patients typically reside in these facilities for long periods of time and have health issues and disorders that require long-term medical attention. Generally, they do not receive daily care from an on- site physician; and, indeed, many facilities do not employ a physician as part of their staff 24 hours a day. Conversely, patients in hospitals are typically there for short periods of time and are regularly monitored by their attending physician or hospital staff physicians. Another important distinction is that states authorize hospitals to have independent controlled substance authority and accordingly hospitals can register with the DEA. This means, among other things, that hospitals are authorized to maintain common stocks of controlled substances for immediate dispensing or administration pursuant to a practitioner`s medication order, and are subject to DEA regulatory oversight and inspection. LTCFs, on the other hand, typically have no independent state or federal controlled substance authority and accordingly are not eligible to become DEA registrants. This means they may not maintain common stocks of controlled substances. Therefore, any prescribed medication in a LTCF setting belongs to the patient and not the facility. Further, LTCFs are not subject to DEA oversight, recordkeeping requirements, inspection, administrative or civil sanctions. Though they lack controlled substance authority, LTCFs are, however, subject to other types of state and federal regulatory oversight. Federally, the Department of Health and Human Services regulates LTCFs that are certified for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and most - if not all - states regulate these facilities as well. Other important distinctions between hospitals and LTCFs are reflected in the CSA and its implementing regulations. THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT GENERALLY Since the enactment of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) 40 years ago, federal law has mandated that a controlled substance may only be prescribed or dispensed by a DEA-registered practitioner. Furthermore, prior to the issuance of any such prescription, the practitioner, acting in the usual course of professional practice, must determine, each and every time, that there is a legitimate medical purpose for the patient to receive the drug being dispensed. The CSA established this closed system of distribution (CSD) to provide security and accountability for the nations` controlled substance supply. Specifically, the CSD is a system of registration, accountability requirements, and security measures that protect the integrity of the controlled substance supply chain from the procurement of raw materials to the dispensing of controlled substances to ultimate users. The system ensures that there is an adequate supply of controlled substances for legitimate medical, research and industrial needs, while at the same time protects the public from the diversion of controlled substances into the illicit market. Most importantly, the requirements are designed to facilitate appropriate medical care and thereby ensure the safety of patients. One of the most important principles underlying the CSA and its implementing regulations is that every prescription for a controlled substance must be predicated on a determination of legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice. The usual course of professional practice is described as those actions that are in accordance with the standards of medical practice generally accepted in the United States. The following key regulations pertain to a valid prescription as part of the CSA`s closed system of distribution: -- Prescriptions must be dated as of the date signed, and are required to contain specific information including: name and address of the patient; drug name and strength; dosage form; quantity prescribed; directions for use; and name, address, and DEA number of the issuing practitioner. 21 C.F.R. 1306.05(a). -- A valid prescription for a controlled substance must be issued by a DEA-registered practitioner for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice. 21 C.F.R. 1306.04(a); U.S. v Moore, 423 US 122 (1975); and 21 U.S.C. 829(e)(2)(A). A practitioner who issues a prescription for a controlled substance that fails to satisfy this requirement is subject to criminal prosecution under the CSA. See Moore, 423 U.S. at 131 (``only the lawful acts of registrants`` under the CSA are exempted from prosecution under 21 USC 841(a)(1)). Only a DEA registered practitioner may make the determination if a controlled substance is medically necessary. -- In the case of an oral prescription (limited to medications in schedules III-V), the prescription may be communicated to a pharmacist by an employee or agent of the practitioner, but the practitioner remains responsible for ensuring that the prescription conforms in all essential respects to the law and regulations. Even in these instances the pharmacist must reduce the oral prescription to writing. This requires the practitioner to decide - on a prescription by prescription basis - whether there is a legitimate medical purpose for each prescription and that all the essential elements of the prescription are met. -- While the practitioner has a responsibility to ensure that each prescription is issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice, a corresponding responsibility rests upon the pharmacist who fills the prescription. 21 C.F.R. 1306.04(a). -- Additionally, the CSA has always required that a practitioner seeking a DEA registration be authorized to dispense controlled substances by the appropriate licensing body within the state in which he or she practices, or, for Federal practitioners, in the state in which he or she is licensed. The Controlled Substances Act was enacted, in part, to guard against the illegal distribution and improper use of controlled substances, which can have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and welfare of the American people. These detrimental effects can be amplified when the people at issue are residents of LTCFs, who have chronic health problems and disabilities that make them a very fragile patient population. The requirements of the CSA help ensure that a controlled substance is prescribed to a patient only after a DEA registered practitioner has made a determination that the drug is needed to treat a legitimate medical condition. The prescription is then delivered to a pharmacy where the pharmacist is obligated under the CSA to determine if the prescription is valid before dispensing the medication to the patient. This system of checks and balances helps combat diversion, but also protects the patient. If such substances are illegally dispensed to the patient without the proper medical determination by a qualified practitioner, the health of the patient could be jeopardized. This is particularly true for Schedule II and III opioids, which can have dangerous side effects that could harm rather than help the patient`s condition. THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT AS APPLIED TO LTCFs There are numerous ways for residents of LTCFs to obtain prescription medications within the confines of the Controlled Substances Act. The most traditional approach would be for the resident`s physician, or other DEA-registered practitioner, upon an in-person visit, to write a prescription for the needed controlled substances. That prescription would then be provided in written form to a pharmacy, which would fill the prescription. In the case of prescriptions for Schedule III -V controlled substances, in lieu of a written prescription, the practitioner or his agent could call in an oral prescription to the pharmacy. While every prescription for a controlled substance must be predicated on a proper medical evaluation by the practitioner, an in-person visit is not always feasible in the LTCF setting. In particular, because the resident`s physician, or other DEA- registered practitioner, is often not located on the LTCF premises, he or she may not be able to visit the resident as frequently or as quickly as the resident may require, and may not be present when pain presents. Recognizing the unique nature of the LTCF setting, DEA has implemented numerous regulations over the years to make it easier to dispense controlled substances to patients in LTCFs, while at the same time ensuring that the administration of those substances is always pursuant to a valid prescription of a DEA-registered practitioner, and that the health of the patient is never compromised. Currently, short of an in-person visit from the resident`s physician or other DEA- registered practitioner and delivery of a written prescription to the pharmacy, the following regulatory options and exemptions help ensure that patients` medical needs at LTCFs are met: -- For schedule II controlled substances, a practitioner or a practitioner`s agent may fax to a pharmacy a prescription written by the practitioner for a LTCF resident. This accommodation obviates the need to physically deliver a Schedule II written prescription to the pharmacy, and results in time and resource savings for LTCFs. This can be particularly helpful to LTCFs, because in many circumstances a resident's physician (or the covering physician, or other DEA-registered practitioner) may not always be available on-site; this option allows a nurse at an LTCF to call the practitioner to relay information about the patient`s state, and the practitioner can then fax a prescription directly to the pharmacy from his remote location. It should be noted that in ordinary, non-LTCF circumstances, schedule II controlled substances may only be dispensed pursuant to an original, written prescription of a practitioner, as they have a particularly high abuse potential. 21 U.S.C. 829(a). -- In LTCFs, just as in outpatient settings, there are instances when an emergency arises (i.e., breakthough pain) and controlled substances are needed expeditiously. DEA has worked to accommodate the special circumstances of LTCFs for these instances as well. For example, practitioners may issue emergency oral prescriptions to a pharmacy, followed by a written prescription to the dispensing pharmacy within seven days. To further facilitate the receipt of controlled substances under these circumstances, DEA has allowed pharmacies to establish ``emergency kits`` in the LTCFs that are routinely stocked with commonly dispensed controlled substances. These kits are extensions of the pharmacy and are controlled under the pharmacy`s DEA registration. In the case that a practitioner himself is not available on site, a nurse at a LTCF can access the medications in the emergency kit after a practitioner has called in the emergency oral prescription to the pharmacy or faxed a written prescription to the pharmacy. -- Another regulation specifically designed to accommodate LTCFs provides for the dispensing of controlled substances on the premises of a LTCF through the use of an automated dispensing machine. Such dispensing must still be accomplished via a legitimate prescription, but these machines can alleviate much of the burden on LTCFs by placing the supply of controlled substances directly on-site for convenient dispensing to a patient. 21 C.F.R. 1301.27. Once a pharmacy receives a valid prescription issued by the practitioner, the pharmacy initiates the release of the prescribed drugs from the automated dispensing machine at the LTCF by remotely entering a code. Thereafter, a practitioner or authorized nurse at the LTCF enters another code that completes release of the drugs from the machine. In this manner, pharmacies may, in their discretion, dispense small amounts of the drugs (e.g., daily doses) rather than the entire amount indicated on the prescription at one time. The automated dispensing machines may be used in both emergency and nonemergency situations. The automated dispensing systems thereby provide at least two benefits: (1) they allow for immediate dispensing of controlled substances in emergency situations and (2)they help to prevent accumulation of unused medications at the LTCF . -- Under the CSA, practitioners may not issue refills for schedule II controlled substance prescriptions. 21 U.S.C. 829(a). However, DEA has implemented a regulation that allows practitioners to issue multiple prescriptions authorizing a patient to receive up to a 90-day supply for these substances. 21 C.F.R. 1306.12. This accommodation applies to all practitioners, not just those with patients in LTCFs, but it can be particularly useful in the LTCF setting where a doctor sometimes visits the patient only once every 30 or 60 days. -- Pharmacists may also partially fill schedule II prescriptions for LTCF patients or individuals with terminal illnesses, as long as the amount dispensed does not exceed the total prescribed and occurs within 60 days of the date that the prescription was written. (21 C.F.R. 1306.13(b)). This lessens the extent to which LTCFs accumulate unused controlled substances. -- For schedules III-V controlled substances, prescriptions may be written, but may also be orally transmitted or faxed by the practitioner or the practitioner`s agent. In addition, such prescriptions may be refilled up to five times in a six-month period as directed by the practitioner. 21 C.F.R. 1306.22. Partial filling is also permissible for schedule III-V prescriptions not to exceed 6 months from date of issuance. Finally and importantly, DEA is also pleased to announce that OMB has concluded review of an Interim Final Rule that will allow electronic prescribing of controlled substances, which will soon be published in the Federal Register. This rule will provide yet another tool for practitioners to use when prescribing a controlled substance for their patients, including those who reside in a LTCF. This rule will allow practitioner to use a computer, laptop or PDA device to send a prescription to a pharmacy from a remote location instantaneously. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AT LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES As a result of its investigations of complaints received from pharmacists and others, DEA is aware that some pharmacies affiliated with LTCFs are violating the CSA and its implementing regulations by dispensing controlled substances based upon the receipt of a faxed ``chart order`` from nurses of these facilities in lieu of a valid prescription issued by a practitioner. In some instances this was done completely independently of any practitioner. As examples, investigations have revealed instances of nurses calling or faxing in schedule II & III prescriptions without a practitioner`s knowledge; the quantity of controlled substances prescribed being determined by the pharmacist rather than the practitioner; and large numbers of prescriptions being filled under an ``emergency`` exemption when no emergency existed.

Statement of Joseph Rannazzisi Deputy Assistant Administrator Drug Enforcement Administration Committee on Senate Special Aging March 24, 2010 INTRODUCTION Chairman Kohl, Ranking Member Corker, and distinguished members of the Committee, I thank you for holding this hearing regarding the issue of prescribing controlled substances to patients at Long-Term Care Facilities (LTCFs). Let me assure you that both the Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) share your concern over the health and welfare of patients that are cared for in these facilities. LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES Federal regulations define a LTCF as ``a nursing home, retirement care, mental care or other facility or institution which provides extended health care to resident patients.`` 21 C.F.R. 1300.01(25). LTCFs serve an important role in the nation`s health care system by providing both non-medical and medical care for patients suffering from chronic health problems and/or disabilities.
 There are important differences and distinctions that set LTCFs apart from other health care facilities such as hospitals. First and foremost, LTCFs are the patient`s ``home.`` Patients typically reside in these facilities for long periods of time and have health issues and disorders that require long-term medical attention. Generally, they do not receive daily care from an on- site physician; and, indeed, many facilities do not employ a physician as part of their staff 24 hours a day. Conversely, patients in hospitals are typically there for short periods of time and are regularly monitored by their attending physician or hospital staff physicians. Another important distinction is that states authorize hospitals to have independent controlled substance authority and accordingly hospitals can register with the DEA. This means, among other things, that hospitals are authorized to maintain common stocks of controlled substances for immediate dispensing or administration pursuant to a practitioner`s medication order, and are subject to DEA regulatory oversight and inspection. LTCFs, on the other hand, typically have no independent state or federal controlled substance authority and accordingly are not eligible to become DEA registrants. This means they may not maintain common stocks of controlled substances. Therefore, any prescribed medication in a LTCF setting belongs to the patient and not the facility. Further, LTCFs are not subject to DEA oversight, recordkeeping requirements, inspection, administrative or civil sanctions. Though they lack controlled substance authority, LTCFs are, however, subject to other types of state and federal regulatory oversight. Federally, the Department of Health and Human Services regulates LTCFs that are certified for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and most - if not all - states regulate these facilities as well. Other important distinctions between hospitals and LTCFs are reflected in the CSA and its implementing regulations. THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT GENERALLY Since the enactment of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) 40 years ago, federal law has mandated that a controlled substance may only be prescribed or dispensed by a DEA-registered practitioner. Furthermore, prior to the issuance of any such prescription, the practitioner, acting in the usual course of professional practice, must determine, each and every time, that there is a legitimate medical purpose for the patient to receive the drug being dispensed. The CSA established this closed system of distribution (CSD) to provide security and accountability for the nations` controlled substance supply. Specifically, the CSD is a system of registration, accountability requirements, and security measures that protect the integrity of the controlled substance supply chain from the procurement of raw materials to the dispensing of controlled substances to ultimate users. The system ensures that there is an adequate supply of controlled substances for legitimate medical, research and industrial needs, while at the same time protects the public from the diversion of controlled substances into the illicit market. Most importantly, the requirements are designed to facilitate appropriate medical care and thereby ensure the safety of patients. One of the most important principles underlying the CSA and its implementing regulations is that every prescription for a controlled substance must be predicated on a determination of legitimate medical purpose by an individual practitioner acting in the usual course of professional practice. The usual course of professional practice is described as those actions that are in accordance with the standards of medical practice generally accepted in the United States. The following key regulations pertain to a valid prescription as part of the CSA`s closed system of distribution: -- Prescriptions must be dated as of the date signed, and are required to contain specific information including: name and address of the patient; drug name and strength; dosage form; quantity prescribed; directions for use; and name, address, and DEA number of the issuing practitioner. 21 C.F.R. 1306.05(a). -- A valid prescription for a controlled substance must be issued by a DEA-registered practitioner for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice. 21 C.F.R. 1306.04(a); U.S. v Moore, 423 US 122 (1975); and 21 U.S.C. 829(e)(2)(A). A practitioner who issues a prescription for a controlled substance that fails to satisfy this requirement is subject to criminal prosecution under the CSA. See Moore, 423 U.S. at 131 (``only the lawful acts of registrants`` under the CSA are exempted from prosecution under 21 USC 841(a)(1)). Only a DEA registered practitioner may make the determination if a controlled substance is medically necessary. -- In the case of an oral prescription (limited to medications in schedules III-V), the prescription may be communicated to a pharmacist by an employee or agent of the practitioner, but the practitioner remains responsible for ensuring that the prescription conforms in all essential respects to the law and regulations. Even in these instances the pharmacist must reduce the oral prescription to writing. This requires the practitioner to decide - on a prescription by prescription basis - whether there is a legitimate medical purpose for each prescription and that all the essential elements of the prescription are met. -- While the practitioner has a responsibility to ensure that each prescription is issued for a legitimate medical purpose in the usual course of professional practice, a corresponding responsibility rests upon the pharmacist who fills the prescription. 21 C.F.R. 1306.04(a). -- Additionally, the CSA has always required that a practitioner seeking a DEA registration be authorized to dispense controlled substances by the appropriate licensing body within the state in which he or she practices, or, for Federal practitioners, in the state in which he or she is licensed. The Controlled Substances Act was enacted, in part, to guard against the illegal distribution and improper use of controlled substances, which can have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and welfare of the American people. These detrimental effects can be amplified when the people at issue are residents of LTCFs, who have chronic health problems and disabilities that make them a very fragile patient population. The requirements of the CSA help ensure that a controlled substance is prescribed to a patient only after a DEA registered practitioner has made a determination that the drug is needed to treat a legitimate medical condition. The prescription is then delivered to a pharmacy where the pharmacist is obligated under the CSA to determine if the prescription is valid before dispensing the medication to the patient. This system of checks and balances helps combat diversion, but also protects the patient. If such substances are illegally dispensed to the patient without the proper medical determination by a qualified practitioner, the health of the patient could be jeopardized. This is particularly true for Schedule II and III opioids, which can have dangerous side effects that could harm rather than help the patient`s condition. THE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT AS APPLIED TO LTCFs There are numerous ways for residents of LTCFs to obtain prescription medications within the confines of the Controlled Substances Act. The most traditional approach would be for the resident`s physician, or other DEA-registered practitioner, upon an in-person visit, to write a prescription for the needed controlled substances. That prescription would then be provided in written form to a pharmacy, which would fill the prescription. In the case of prescriptions for Schedule III -V controlled substances, in lieu of a written prescription, the practitioner or his agent could call in an oral prescription to the pharmacy. While every prescription for a controlled substance must be predicated on a proper medical evaluation by the practitioner, an in-person visit is not always feasible in the LTCF setting. In particular, because the resident`s physician, or other DEA- registered practitioner, is often not located on the LTCF premises, he or she may not be able to visit the resident as frequently or as quickly as the resident may require, and may not be present when pain presents. Recognizing the unique nature of the LTCF setting, DEA has implemented numerous regulations over the years to make it easier to dispense controlled substances to patients in LTCFs, while at the same time ensuring that the administration of those substances is always pursuant to a valid prescription of a DEA-registered practitioner, and that the health of the patient is never compromised. Currently, short of an in-person visit from the resident`s physician or other DEA- registered practitioner and delivery of a written prescription to the pharmacy, the following regulatory options and exemptions help ensure that patients` medical needs at LTCFs are met: -- For schedule II controlled substances, a practitioner or a practitioner`s agent may fax to a pharmacy a prescription written by the practitioner for a LTCF resident. This accommodation obviates the need to physically deliver a Schedule II written prescription to the pharmacy, and results in time and resource savings for LTCFs. This can be particularly helpful to LTCFs, because in many circumstances a resident's physician (or the covering physician, or other DEA-registered practitioner) may not always be available on-site; this option allows a nurse at an LTCF to call the practitioner to relay information about the patient`s state, and the practitioner can then fax a prescription directly to the pharmacy from his remote location. It should be noted that in ordinary, non-LTCF circumstances, schedule II controlled substances may only be dispensed pursuant to an original, written prescription of a practitioner, as they have a particularly high abuse potential. 21 U.S.C. 829(a). -- In LTCFs, just as in outpatient settings, there are instances when an emergency arises (i.e., breakthough pain) and controlled substances are needed expeditiously. DEA has worked to accommodate the special circumstances of LTCFs for these instances as well. For example, practitioners may issue emergency oral prescriptions to a pharmacy, followed by a written prescription to the dispensing pharmacy within seven days. To further facilitate the receipt of controlled substances under these circumstances, DEA has allowed pharmacies to establish ``emergency kits`` in the LTCFs that are routinely stocked with commonly dispensed controlled substances. These kits are extensions of the pharmacy and are controlled under the pharmacy`s DEA registration. In the case that a practitioner himself is not available on site, a nurse at a LTCF can access the medications in the emergency kit after a practitioner has called in the emergency oral prescription to the pharmacy or faxed a written prescription to the pharmacy. -- Another regulation specifically designed to accommodate LTCFs provides for the dispensing of controlled substances on the premises of a LTCF through the use of an automated dispensing machine. Such dispensing must still be accomplished via a legitimate prescription, but these machines can alleviate much of the burden on LTCFs by placing the supply of controlled substances directly on-site for convenient dispensing to a patient. 21 C.F.R. 1301.27. Once a pharmacy receives a valid prescription issued by the practitioner, the pharmacy initiates the release of the prescribed drugs from the automated dispensing machine at the LTCF by remotely entering a code. Thereafter, a practitioner or authorized nurse at the LTCF enters another code that completes release of the drugs from the machine. In this manner, pharmacies may, in their discretion, dispense small amounts of the drugs (e.g., daily doses) rather than the entire amount indicated on the prescription at one time. The automated dispensing machines may be used in both emergency and nonemergency situations. The automated dispensing systems thereby provide at least two benefits: (1) they allow for immediate dispensing of controlled substances in emergency situations and (2)they help to prevent accumulation of unused medications at the LTCF . -- Under the CSA, practitioners may not issue refills for schedule II controlled substance prescriptions. 21 U.S.C. 829(a). However, DEA has implemented a regulation that allows practitioners to issue multiple prescriptions authorizing a patient to receive up to a 90-day supply for these substances. 21 C.F.R. 1306.12. This accommodation applies to all practitioners, not just those with patients in LTCFs, but it can be particularly useful in the LTCF setting where a doctor sometimes visits the patient only once every 30 or 60 days. -- Pharmacists may also partially fill schedule II prescriptions for LTCF patients or individuals with terminal illnesses, as long as the amount dispensed does not exceed the total prescribed and occurs within 60 days of the date that the prescription was written. (21 C.F.R. 1306.13(b)). This lessens the extent to which LTCFs accumulate unused controlled substances. -- For schedules III-V controlled substances, prescriptions may be written, but may also be orally transmitted or faxed by the practitioner or the practitioner`s agent. In addition, such prescriptions may be refilled up to five times in a six-month period as directed by the practitioner. 21 C.F.R. 1306.22. Partial filling is also permissible for schedule III-V prescriptions not to exceed 6 months from date of issuance. Finally and importantly, DEA is also pleased to announce that OMB has concluded review of an Interim Final Rule that will allow electronic prescribing of controlled substances, which will soon be published in the Federal Register. This rule will provide yet another tool for practitioners to use when prescribing a controlled substance for their patients, including those who reside in a LTCF. This rule will allow practitioner to use a computer, laptop or PDA device to send a prescription to a pharmacy from a remote location instantaneously. PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUES AT LONG-TERM CARE FACILITIES As a result of its investigations of complaints received from pharmacists and others, DEA is aware that some pharmacies affiliated with LTCFs are violating the CSA and its implementing regulations by dispensing controlled substances based upon the receipt of a faxed ``chart order`` from nurses of these facilities in lieu of a valid prescription issued by a practitioner. In some instances this was done completely independently of any practitioner. As examples, investigations have revealed instances of nurses calling or faxing in schedule II & III prescriptions without a practitioner`s knowledge; the quantity of controlled substances prescribed being determined by the pharmacist rather than the practitioner; and large numbers of prescriptions being filled under an ``emergency`` exemption when no emergency existed. Further, pharmacies have ``shopped`` for doctors to sign prescriptions after the pharmacies received them, regardless of whether those doctors had authorized the prescriptions or if the patients were even under their care. When interviewed, doctors told investigators that they were not involved in the prescription process at all. These practices concern DEA not only because they are violations of the CSA, but because these practices - basically, the dispensing of controlled substances without practitioner involvement in patient care -are dangerous for patients, particularly the vulnerable populations in LTCFs. CONCLUSION Federal law and regulations relating to controlled substances are designed to protect the public health and safety while permitting access for legitimate medical use.

Insurers could charge more if a consumer's medical history discloses health problems.  Nonetheless, administration officials said they believe the short-term option will be welcomed by people who need an individual health insurance policy but don't qualify for the ACA's income-based subsidies.  Those in this largely middle-class crowd make too much for subsidies and have absorbed years of price hikes. Some say they now face monthly, mortgage-size payments of well over $1,000 for health insurance. Then they usually have to pay a deductible of several thousand dollars. Research indicates the uninsured rate among these customers is growing.  ""If you are not subsidized, the options can be really unaffordable for folks, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters. The administration estimates monthly premiums for a short-term plan could be about than one-third of what a comprehensive policy costs.  Democrats swiftly branded it a return to ""junk insurance, and the main insurance industry lobbying group said it was concerned the Trump plan could divide the healthy from the sick in the market and make it more expensive to cover those with health problems.  Democrats say the solution is to increase government subsidies, so that more middle-class people will be eligible for taxpayer assistance to buy comprehensive coverage. The Obama administration had limited short-term plans to periods of no longer than three months, making them impractical for many consumers.  Trump administration officials reject the notion that they're trying to undermine the ACA. Instead, they say they are trying to make things more workable for people who are not being helped by the health law.  The administration estimates that only about 100,000 to 200,000 people will drop coverage they now have under the ACA and switch to cheaper short-term policies. They also say they expect short-term plans could attract many people among the estimated 28 million who remain uninsured.  ""What we see right now is that there are healthy people sitting on the sidelines without coverage, and this is an opportunity to provide them with coverage, said Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which also administers the Obama-era health law.  A government economic analysis that accompanied the proposal forecast a moderate increase in premiums among customers sticking with their ACA plans through HealthCare.gov. Because subsidies are tied to the cost of premiums, taxpayers would end up spending more.  Administration officials said there's no final decision on whether consumers will have a legal right to renew coverage under one of the new short-term plans.  One major health insurance company, United Healthcare, is already positioning itself to market short-term plans.  But others in the industry see them as a niche product for people in life transitions, like being in-between jobs, moving to another state, or retiring before Medicare kicks in.  ""I certainly wouldn't recommend them to someone receiving a significant subsidy or who has ongoing health issues, but there are certain times and certain places where it makes sense, said Jeff Smedsrud, an insurance entrepreneur whose companies sell short-term plans.  Consumer advocates say customers should read the fine print carefully to make sure the plan will cover their expected bills.  The administration's proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days. Verma said she hopes the new rules will be finalized as soon as possible, meaning plans would be on the market later this year.  However, short-term coverage won't count as qualifying coverage under the Obama health law for 2018. That means consumers with such plans would legally be considered uninsured, putting them at risk of fines. That wouldn't be a problem next year, when repeal of the ACA requirement that most Americans have coverage takes effect.  Tuesday's proposal follows another administration regulation that would allow groups to offer ""association health plans also exempt from ACA requirements to small businesses and sole proprietors.

The Obama administration had limited short-term plans to periods of no longer than three months, making them impractical for many consumers.  Trump administration officials reject the notion that they're trying to undermine the ACA. Instead, they say they are trying to make things more workable for people who are not being helped by the health law.  The administration estimates that only about 100,000 to 200,000 people will drop coverage they now have under the ACA and switch to cheaper short-term policies. They also say they expect short-term plans could attract many people among the estimated 28 million who remain uninsured.  ""What we see right now is that there are healthy people sitting on the sidelines without coverage, and this is an opportunity to provide them with coverage, said Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which also administers the Obama-era health law.  A government economic analysis that accompanied the proposal forecast a moderate increase in premiums among customers sticking with their ACA plans through HealthCare.gov. Because subsidies are tied to the cost of premiums, taxpayers would end up spending more.  Administration officials said there's no final decision on whether consumers will have a legal right to renew coverage under one of the new short-term plans.  One major health insurance company, United Healthcare, is already positioning itself to market short-term plans.  But others in the industry see them as a niche product for people in life transitions, like being in-between jobs, moving to another state, or retiring before Medicare kicks in.  ""I certainly wouldn't recommend them to someone receiving a significant subsidy or who has ongoing health issues, but there are certain times and certain places where it makes sense, said Jeff Smedsrud, an insurance entrepreneur whose companies sell short-term plans.  Consumer advocates say customers should read the fine print carefully to make sure the plan will cover their expected bills.  The administration's proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days. Verma said she hopes the new rules will be finalized as soon as possible, meaning plans would be on the market later this year.  However, short-term coverage won't count as qualifying coverage under the Obama health law for 2018. That means consumers with such plans would legally be considered uninsured, putting them at risk of fines. That wouldn't be a problem next year, when repeal of the ACA requirement that most Americans have coverage takes effect.  Tuesday's proposal follows another administration regulation that would allow groups to offer ""association health plans also exempt from ACA requirements to small businesses and sole proprietors. Having failed to repeal ""Obamacare, Trump is now chipping away at it through regulations and waivers.  The plan doesn't affect people with job-based coverage, still the mainstay for workers and their families."

262,250310,"Three local authority employees received a total remuneration of over £100,000 a year, according to The Taxpayers’ Alliance’s (TPA) annual ‘Council Rich List’.  In total, the council spent £513,013 in pay and pension contributions last year to four of their most senior staff members.  Joyce White OBE, West Dunbartonshire Council’s chief executive, received the highest salary of £124,956.  She also benefitted from £24,074 in pension contributions — taking her total package to £149,030 last year.  The other council employees who received more than £100,000 are Angela Wilson, strategic director of transformation and public sector reform, as well as Richard Cairns, strategic director of regeneration, environment and growth, who both took home salaries of £108,535.  They also both received £20,910 in pension contributions.  And Stephen West, strategic lead for resources, earned a salary of £88,116 and his pension contributions brought his total remuneration to £105,092.  The TPA’s annual Town Hall Rich List is a council-by-council breakdown of local government executive pay deals.  According to the organisation, in 2018/19 there were at least 2,667 council employees who received total remuneration in excess of £100,000.  They say that is 226 more than in 2017/18, and the highest number since 2013/14.  According to the figures, Glasgow City Council had the highest number of employees earning over £150,000 at 12.

While it is probably obvious to most in the market - and certainly to any practising financial adviser - that value is about more than just cost, it is helpful that it is explicitly spelled out in black and white by the regulator.  The three value-for-money metrics set out by the FCA feel like broadly the right ones and should give governance committees enough latitude to consider other things that might be important to members such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and choice.  Lack of competition in workplace pensions  The role of governance committees is particularly important in the workplace pensions market, where millions of people have been nudged into saving for retirement through automatic enrolment.  A sizeable chunk of these people will not have engaged at all with their pension and will simply be rolled into their default investment fund.  Indeed, many may also take little interest in their retirement income options either and it is these ‘double defaulters' who are the key target market for investment pathways reforms introduced in February.  In the SIPP market, by contrast, people who have actively chosen to save for retirement - and often picked investments already on this basis - have not flocked to pathways investments. It remains a bone of contention that, despite the very clear difference between the self-directed market and the auto-enrolment market, the pathways requirements have been applied in a uniform manner.  Because of the lack of competitive pressures in the auto-enrolment market - particularly where there isn't a corporate adviser in place to hold a scheme's feet to the fire - governance committees were introduced to act on behalf of the ‘buy-side' (i.e. auto-enrolment members).  Hubris key danger as focus drifts from charges  While most agree costs and charges are just part of the value-for-money equation, they remain key and one of the few elements of retirement planning savers have total control over.  It is therefore important the price savers pay for their pensions remains at the top of the agenda, as even fairly small differences can add up to tens of thousands of pounds in lost retirement income.  Governance committees and the 0.75% default fund charge cap may act to shield members to a degree, but now is not the time for policymakers to rest on their laurels.  There is no particular reason why 0.75% should remain the long-term ‘right' price for auto-enrolment pensions, and as providers build assets it is crucial the benefits of scale are passed onto customers rather than being swallowed up.  It was therefore somewhat concerning to read that the Productive Finance Group Working Group - whose members include the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FCA - believes there has been an ‘excessive' focus on costs and charges in workplace DC pensions.  The context of this is the Government's desire to boost the UK economy by driving pension assets to illiquid investments, but the rhetoric feels at odds with the direction of policy in the last decade or so.  It is of course the case that value is a complex concept with many elements that need to be considered. But for governance committees to be effective, it is critical costs and charges remain front-and-centre of the debate.

There is no particular reason why 0.75% should remain the long-term ‘right' price for auto-enrolment pensions, and as providers build assets it is crucial the benefits of scale are passed onto customers rather than being swallowed up.  It was therefore somewhat concerning to read that the Productive Finance Group Working Group - whose members include the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FCA - believes there has been an ‘excessive' focus on costs and charges in workplace DC pensions.  The context of this is the Government's desire to boost the UK economy by driving pension assets to illiquid investments, but the rhetoric feels at odds with the direction of policy in the last decade or so.  It is of course the case that value is a complex concept with many elements that need to be considered. But for governance committees to be effective, it is critical costs and charges remain front-and-centre of the debate.  Tom Selby is head of retirement policy at AJ Bell  To view photo, click here."

266,267975,"Standard energy prices are now capped by the regulator, but it’s a fact that the best energy deals are still found by switching energy supplier. You could save hundreds of pounds every year, especially if you’re one of the roughly 15m UK households on a standard variable or default tariff. So which is the best energy comparison site – and how do you switch? That's where we can help.  How to switch energy provider  Using an energy comparison service is easy. Simply share some basic details about your home and current energy use, and in less than two minutes you’ll be shown a range of gas and electric quotes to help you save money on your bills. Here's how you do it...  * Choose one of the best energy comparison sites from the list below  * Supply details about your home and current energy use  * Browse the results  * Switch to the tariff you choose via the price comparison site  How to choose the best energy comparison site  The best energy comparison sites are Ofgem-accredited, so make sure you look for confirmation of this before choosing a service. It means the energy prices and options you’re shown have been calculated fairly, in an unbiased way – and that the service will have an effective complaints process, too.  Bear in mind that most independent energy comparison sites will initially show you only a list of tariffs they can switch you to. That's because energy comparison sites make money by charging a fee to the suppliers every time they complete an energy switch. These commercial relationships keep the energy comparison free for customers, and enable the sites to handle the energy switch for you – making it quick, efficient and hassle-free. They also allow the best energy comparison sites to negotiate exclusive deals that you won’t be offered directly by an energy supplier  However, often the very cheapest deals are ones they can’t switch you to (you’ll need to go directly to the energy supplier) so make sure you filter your search results to show all plans. Here's our pick of the best energy comparison sites out there...  The 3 best energy comparison sites in the UK  1. Money Supermarket  The best energy comparison site in the UK overall  Claimed savings in our test: £479 - £504 | Founded: 1998 | Ofgem accredited: yes | Exclusive deals: yes  Compare energy prices at Money SupermarketVery easy to useAsked more questions for accurate quotesExcellent customer reviews Cheapest deals shown were the same as other sites  When it comes to energy comparison, we think independent price comparison service Money Supermarket is the best energy comparison site out there – both for domestic and business customers. It’s reliable: Money Supermarket is fully accredited by Ofgem, and boasts an impressive 4.5 out of 5 star rating from over 1,000 customer reviews over on TrustPilot.  The website is also easy to use. Simply enter your postcode and energy habits, and you’ll be shown a list of the best energy plans in your area – we were shown over 50 tariffs that MoneySupermarket could switch us to, plus many more deals that we could switch to directly through the supplier.  Interestingly, all three energy comparison sites in this guide told us that e.on’s Fix Online Exclusive v30 deal (a 12-month fixed-rate contract) was the cheapest we could get. But each calculated our projected energy costs for the next 12 months differently, and therefore showed us a slightly different estimated annual saving from the same deal.  While we don't yet know which site was most accurate, we did feel reassured about the consensus over which deal to choose. Overall, we found MoneySupermarket to be the easiest energy comparison site to use. The results were presented very clearly, and we would happily use it again to switch energy provider.  2. USwitch  A beautifully designed energy comparison site that's easy to use  Claimed savings in our test: £495.30 - £519.65 | Founded: 1998 | Ofgem accredited: yes | Exclusive deals: yes  Compare energy prices at USwitchQuick to useGood range of quotesWell-presented results  USwitch is another of the UK’s best energy comparison sites. It’s been fully accredited by Ofgem since 2006, and boasts an impressive 4.5 out of 5 star rating from over 4,000 customer reviews over on TrustPilot. It’s also authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority, and a Feedo 2020 Gold Trusted Service award winner.  Like MoneySupermarket, USwitch's energy comparison service is very easy to use: it took us less than a minute to provide our details. (Alternatively, you can call the service for free and talk about your energy switch over the phone.)  As we flagged above, USwitch calculated a slightly higher projected annual energy cost for us than Money Supermarket (£1,080 versus Money Supermarket's £1,065), so although the cheapest deal it showed us was the same one Money Supermarket found, USwitch predicted that our annual saving would be £16 higher, at £495.30 (or £519.65, if we looked at tariffs that the site couldn’t switch us too, as well). We don't yet know which prediction is correct – if either – yet, but we'll keep this updated.  One nice touch offered by USwitch is the fact that the company also runs a yearly customer satisfaction report, so you can see how each supplier performs in everything from customer service and value for money to green energy, smart meter installation and more. For reliability, choice and ease of use, we think USwitch is among the best energy comparison sites in the UK.  3. Energy Helpline  Another reliable energy comparison service that will help you switch energy provider  Claimed savings in our test: £453 - or £477 | Founded: 2002 | Ofgem accredited: yes | Exclusive deals: yes  Compare energy prices at Energy HelplineEasy and fast to useGreat range of tariffs to choose  Energy Helpline is another independent energy comparison service that provides fast, free and friendly advice on the best gas and electricity deals. It’s Ofgem accredited, and compares gas and electricity tariffs from all the most reliable energy suppliers – big and small – in the UK.  Like USwitch and Money Supermarket, we found the energy comparison service to be easy use. In our tests, Energy Helpline’s cheapest deals were the same as those found by USwitch and Money Supermarket, but Energy Helpline calculated our annual saving from these deals to be lower once again, at £453 (or £477 if we chose the Outfox The Market deal that Energy Helpline couldn’t switch us to).  Customers like the service, too. Energy Helpline averages 4.5 out of five stars at TrustPilot, across just under 3,000 user reviews (in February 2020). Overall, Energy Helpline is a slick, easy-to-use energy comparison site – we just slightly preferred the feel of Money Supermarket.

270,660691,"What used to be a solid investment class has been undone by excessive debt and some rash overseas adventures but there should be good opportunities in the longer term, writes Bina Brown.  Listed property - the best performing investment asset class for a decade - lost almost a quarter of its value in the year to January 31 as the credit crunch and the woes of Centro Properties Group battered most securities in the sector.  Few sectors had enjoyed spending the vast quantities of money that washed around the financial markets in recent years more than listed property trusts - or LPTs. As long as banks lent LPTs cash, fund managers bought properties to satisfy investors' hunger for higher returns.  But the traditionally defensive asset class - known for its ability to deliver income - adopted aggressive strategies in the process. It was ""basking in the economic sunshine of cheap money"", as one analyst put it.  Complex stapled structures - that wrap up fees from funds management with the performance of property assets - came to dominate a sector once known for its straightforward, income-earning capabilities. But trusts carrying large debt and possibly overpriced properties in the US, the United Kingdom and parts of Europe have come under scrutiny since Centro's problems first made the headlines.  Managers that had borrowed funds to pay twice-yearly distributions are under watch as are those that went beyond bricks and mortar into funds management by launching unlisted property funds.  While nobody is prepared to call an end to the current rout, there is a growing feeling that people prepared to invest for the long term may find well-priced traditional trusts that can outperform.  Traditional property trusts were never meant to outperform other classes of shares but instead to provide a steady income to investors with some capital gain. The sector's outperformance over the past decade - which was helped by the correction that followed the technology boom - was often considered an anomaly.  Macquarie Real Estate Capital co-head Simon Jones says many trusts are trading below their net tangible asset (NTA) value and have yields of 8 to 10 per cent.  This means they may have found a base, although there is no guarantee of a recovery in the short term due to the prospect of higher domestic interest rates. Typically, as interest rates go up the price of listed property goes down.  ""We don't know where the market or interest rates are going. Even the trusts that have dropped a lot are not cheap enough,"" Clime Investment Management executive director Roger Montgomery says.  Analysts are watching the current reporting season to find out more about trust debt levels and the value of their property assets. The classic example is Centro Properties, which recently revealed it had dramatically underestimated its short-term debt, with $2.6 billion of its $3.5 billion debt requiring repayment or refinancing in the next 12 months - a time bomb in the current market. Currently trading at a 76 per cent discount to NTA, the group might be considered cheap if it was not for the extreme funding risks it faces.  PIR director Duguld Higgins says the last time traditional LPTs traded at a discount to net tangible assets was January 2000, at negative 1.4 per cent. Eight years later in January 2008, the discount was 26.3 per cent - although many of the property valuations that underpin those NTA may now be at least six months old.  ""It is likely that the market is over discounting the actual declines likely to be seen in the underlying property market values given limited new supply and a continued strong institutional demand for real estate,"" says Higgins.  He attributes much of the recent selling to ""fear and panic"".  ""There has been a lot of selling with no regard to valuation which is a sign of fear. The burning question is how much longer is the market volatility going to last.  There is a strong argument that real estate investment trusts are coming back to fair value. That said, some trusts are still being hit and there are others that may face further pain,"" says Higgins.  As the sector recovers, investors will face another conundrum.  ""With the recent sale of Investa Group and Multiplex . . . the best part of two-thirds of the index is concentrated in Westfield Group, Stockland Group, GPT and Goodman Group. Further merger and acquisition activity will exacerbate the issue,"" he says. The number of LPTs on the Australian Securities Exchange has already shrunk from 50 to around 25 over the past decade. Beyond the struggling Centro, no-one will predict the trusts likely to become takeover targets although one analyst has named Mirvac Industrial Trust and, potentially, Bunnings Warehouse Trust.  ""The likelihood of a shake-out in the industry is high, but it might take a little while to stabilise first,"" says Higgins.  ""But once it starts, it will probably gather increased interest in the sector and a potential re-rating as the stronger [trusts] forage amongst the weaker ones looking for well-priced acquisitions.  ""Trusts that have an iniquitous cost of capital will be vulnerable to takeovers or mergers.""  Macquarie's Jones says there is a place for stapled securities as well as pure real estate investments, so complex investments like Centro are unlikely to disappear altogether.  ""Both have their advantages and both have a place in the market; income from the traditional property trusts with long-date property returns, and potentially more return on equity with the stapled-type trusts.""  Ken Atchison, managing director of property investment specialist Atchison Consultants, agrees but believes investors will want stapled securities to adopt tighter controls.  Structured vehicles, and their additional activities, have tended to shift too far from the basic function of property, he says. ""I would expect some tightening by investors giving the mandates as to what should be in a listed property trust.""  He says the stapling itself is not the problem but activities such as development and construction - which have different risk profiles to property ownership and management - and the value that should be placed on them.  He expects there to be a greater level of disclosure of additional activities including the income streams flowing from the various sources within a trust.  Atchison says overpaying for property should not put trusts at risk of failure, provided they didn't borrow too much as well.  ""Overpaying by 10 per cent is one thing, but borrowing 90 per cent of that is just madness,"" he says. ""Gearing to 50 or 60 per cent and overpaying by 10 per cent is not going to destroy a business provided it is long-term debt.""","Listed property trusts that are trading at more than a 20% discount to net tangible assets (at Feb26)

Macquarie's Jones says there is a place for stapled securities as well as pure real estate investments, so complex investments like Centro are unlikely to disappear altogether.  ""Both have their advantages and both have a place in the market; income from the traditional property trusts with long-date property returns, and potentially more return on equity with the stapled-type trusts.""  Ken Atchison, managing director of property investment specialist Atchison Consultants, agrees but believes investors will want stapled securities to adopt tighter controls.  Structured vehicles, and their additional activities, have tended to shift too far from the basic function of property, he says. ""I would expect some tightening by investors giving the mandates as to what should be in a listed property trust.""  He says the stapling itself is not the problem but activities such as development and construction - which have different risk profiles to property ownership and management - and the value that should be placed on them.  He expects there to be a greater level of disclosure of additional activities including the income streams flowing from the various sources within a trust.  Atchison says overpaying for property should not put trusts at risk of failure, provided they didn't borrow too much as well.  ""Overpaying by 10 per cent is one thing, but borrowing 90 per cent of that is just madness,"" he says. ""Gearing to 50 or 60 per cent and overpaying by 10 per cent is not going to destroy a business provided it is long-term debt."""

272,1342565,"Of THE GLOBE AND MAIL  TORONTO (Globe and Mail)--Ontario's giant municipal pension fund manager earned a 6.5-per-cent return in 2013 despite introducing a new investment strategy that lost money last year.  The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) said it implemented a new investment approach last year to reduce its public market investments--notably stocks and plain-vanilla bonds--and shift the money into a lower-risk ""beta"" portfolio designed to reduce the long-term effects of major market events such as a stock market crash. The new portfolio relies heavily on holdings such as inflation-linked bonds and commodities.  OMERS said the new risk-based portfolio lost $407-million last year due to a ""sudden and unexpected spike in interest rates"" in the second quarter of last year, which hurt inflation-linked bonds and commodities. The fund offset further losses with a $120-million gain from currency hedging strategies.  OMERS chief executive Michael Nobrega said it ""is difficult to pick a perfect time"" for such a major restructuring, but said OMERS remains committed to the long-term strategy of lowering risk and volatility compared to its old-style portfolio with 60 per cent of assets in equities and 40 per cent in bonds.  ""We expect that we shouldn't judge a strategy in one year,"" Mr. Nobrega told reporters Monday. ""There will always be growing pains. Tweaks will happen.""

James Donegan, president of OMERS Capital Markets division, said the fund has been hedging its Canadian dollar investment exposure for the past six months, which has been a profitable strategy as the dollar has dropped.  ""We have a view that the Canadian dollar is vulnerable ... We think there's more downside. It wouldn't surprise me if I saw 85 cents on the dollar at some point.""  OMERS manages $65.1-billion in pension assets for 440,000 employees and retirees of municipal governments across Ontario. The fund said its assets climbed by over $4-billion from $60.8-billion in 2012, and its funded ratio improved last year by three per cent to 88 per cent, which means the fund has assets equal to 88 per cent of its long-term obligation to fund members' pensions on a solvency basis.  The pension manager said the remaining $8.6-billion deficit will probably be erased at some point between 2021 and 2025 depending on investment returns. OMERS plan members have increased their pension contributions since 2011 to help improve plan funding, but the increases are expected to be removed when OMERS returns to a surplus.  Although the new beta portfolio posted losses, OMERS said its returns were strong in all of its other investment categories. Its public market equities earned more than 20 per cent last year, while private market investments earned 15.5 per cent returns last year. That includes 23.6 per cent returns on private equity holdings, 14.3 per cent returns from real estate group Oxford Properties, and 12.6 per cent returns from infrastructure holdings managed by Borealis Infrastructure.  OMERS needs to earn a long-term annualized return of 7 per cent on its investments to meet its pension obligations.

276,867002,"And that's great, because the power of compounding is seldom taught in schools and its effects truly are miraculous.    Of course, there were sceptics, with some readers writing to say that it's hard to obtain a return of 10 per cent after tax, which was the rate I used in the examples.    Yes, it's not easy to get high returns in the present low-inflation environment, but don't forget the wonderful words of Jim Rohn some people are picking the fruits while others are studying the roots.    Too many people fail to get their investment plans under way because they get so immersed in the fine details that they miss the big picture and never put their ideas into action.    The rate of return you can achieve depends on many factors, which include the asset purchased, the rate of inflation and the tax effectiveness of the vehicle used, so it is going to vary continually.    However, the major lessons of compounding are timeless. How much money you end up with depends on three major factors: time, rate and the sum you invest.    When you are investing for a short term the rate matters little. For example, if you invested $1000 a month for two years at 5 per cent you would have $25,200; at 12 per cent $26,500 just $1300 more.    However, continue the investment program over a long period and the variation is immense.    Think about investing that same $1000 a month for 30 years. At 5 per cent your portfolio would be worth $832,000 but at 10 per cent $2.26 million. That's a difference of nearly $1.5 million.    Is a 30-year term relevant in this modern age? Absolutely! Many people who retire at 60 now may well live to 90. If they don't understand time and rate they face the danger of living longer than their money.    The essence of compounding is that you leave the earnings to grow with the investment instead of spending them. Here's how it works.    Let's assume that you and a friend had $20,000 each invested in a good share that was selling at $4 and producing capital gain of 7 per cent per annum with income of 4 per cent per annum.    If your friend had instructed the company to credit dividends to his or her bank account, the $800 of income would almost certainly become mixed up with all the other money and frittered away on consumer spending.    In contrast, if you had joined the company's dividend reinvestment plan your dividend would have been used to buy another 200 shares. You now have an extra $800 working for you, which is why your portfolio will grow much faster than your friend's as time passes.    Suppose, 10 years ago, you invested $100,000 into a managed fund that matched the All Ordinaries Index. If you had spent all your dividends from your investment you would now have $191,000. But if you had reinvested all those dividends your portfolio would now be worth $279,000 thanks to the miracle of compound interest.    So what strategies can you use to start enjoying the benefits of compounding?    For starters, any investment, or investment vehicle, that allows you to let the earnings stay grafted to the original investment. Superannuation funds and insurance bonds are ideal because the funds pay the tax on your behalf then credit the after-tax profits to your account, making it virtually impossible to get your hands on it.

PERSONAL FINANCE  

JUDGING by the volume of correspondence I received, the recent column on the miracle of compounding struck a chord with many readers.  
And that's great, because the power of compounding is seldom taught in schools and its effects truly are miraculous.    Of course, there were sceptics, with some readers writing to say that it's hard to obtain a return of 10 per cent after tax, which was the rate I used in the examples.    Yes, it's not easy to get high returns in the present low-inflation environment, but don't forget the wonderful words of Jim Rohn some people are picking the fruits while others are studying the roots.    Too many people fail to get their investment plans under way because they get so immersed in the fine details that they miss the big picture and never put their ideas into action.    The rate of return you can achieve depends on many factors, which include the asset purchased, the rate of inflation and the tax effectiveness of the vehicle used, so it is going to vary continually.    However, the major lessons of compounding are timeless. How much money you end up with depends on three major factors: time, rate and the sum you invest.    When you are investing for a short term the rate matters little. For example, if you invested $1000 a month for two years at 5 per cent you would have $25,200; at 12 per cent $26,500 just $1300 more.    However, continue the investment program over a long period and the variation is immense.    Think about investing that same $1000 a month for 30 years. At 5 per cent your portfolio would be worth $832,000 but at 10 per cent $2.26 million. That's a difference of nearly $1.5 million.    Is a 30-year term relevant in this modern age? Absolutely! Many people who retire at 60 now may well live to 90. If they don't understand time and rate they face the danger of living longer than their money.    The essence of compounding is that you leave the earnings to grow with the investment instead of spending them. Here's how it works.    Let's assume that you and a friend had $20,000 each invested in a good share that was selling at $4 and producing capital gain of 7 per cent per annum with income of 4 per cent per annum.    If your friend had instructed the company to credit dividends to his or her bank account, the $800 of income would almost certainly become mixed up with all the other money and frittered away on consumer spending.    In contrast, if you had joined the company's dividend reinvestment plan your dividend would have been used to buy another 200 shares. You now have an extra $800 working for you, which is why your portfolio will grow much faster than your friend's as time passes.    Suppose, 10 years ago, you invested $100,000 into a managed fund that matched the All Ordinaries Index. If you had spent all your dividends from your investment you would now have $191,000. But if you had reinvested all those dividends your portfolio would now be worth $279,000 thanks to the miracle of compound interest.    So what strategies can you use to start enjoying the benefits of compounding?    For starters, any investment, or investment vehicle, that allows you to let the earnings stay grafted to the original investment. Superannuation funds and insurance bonds are ideal because the funds pay the tax on your behalf then credit the after-tax profits to your account, making it virtually impossible to get your hands on it.    Managed funds are perfect as long as you reinvest dividends, and shares are good if the company has a dividend reinvestment scheme. If they don't offer this facility a way out is to bank all dividends in a separate bank account and buy more shares as the balance builds up.    Never forget that the secret to investing is to control as many assets as you can as soon as possible.    This is why borrowing for growth assets like property and shares is so powerful. Think about it it would take you forever to save that first $100,000 but you can rent $100,000 for a tax-deductible $6500 a year and have $100,000 working for you immediately.

John and Kenneth, from Dulwich, in southeast London, married at Marylebone register office in 2014.

280,662754,"Homeowners with low mortgage rates are balking at the prospect of selling their homes to borrow at much higher rates for their next homes, a development that could limit the supply of houses for sale for years to come.  Housing inventory has risen from record lows earlier this year as more homes sit on the market longer. But the number of newly listed homes in the four weeks ended Sept. 18 fell 20% year-over-year, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp. That is an indication that sellers who don't need to sell are staying on the sidelines, economists say.  Larry and Corina Lewis of Tarrytown, N.Y., have two children and expect to need a bigger home in the next few years. But their current 30-year mortgage rate is 2.75%.  ""The thought of giving this up in order to pay double in interest, that's a nauseating thought for me,"" Mr. Lewis said. Even if the average mortgage rate falls from its current level, he said, ""I still don't see it ever getting quite that low.""  Some homeowners will always need to sell due to job relocations, divorces, deaths or other life events. Yet if those who have the option not to move decide to stay put, that could keep the inventory of homes for sale below normal levels and keep home prices elevated, even if demand remains low.  The lack of housing inventory is one of the major reasons home prices have remained near record highs, despite seven straight months of declining sales as interest rates have roughly doubled since the start of the year.  ""I like to call it the 'golden handcuffs' of mortgage rates,"" said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corp. ""You've got existing homeowners who are sitting on these rock-bottom rates, and what is their financial incentive to move and lock into a rate that's potentially as much as 3 percentage points higher than what they've locked into?""  Millions of Americans locked in historically low borrowing rates in recent years when the Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates low. As of July 31, nearly nine of every 10 first-lien mortgages had an interest rate below 5% and more than two-thirds had a rate below 4%, according to mortgage-data firm Black Knight Inc. About 83% of those mortgages are 30-year fixed rates, Black Knight said.  The Fed reversed course and started to raise rates in March in an effort to tame inflation. Those rate increases, including another three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday, have rippled through the mortgage market. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.29% in the week ended Sept. 22, up from 2.88% a year earlier, according to housing-finance agency Freddie Mac.  Alyssa and Brandon McDuffie reached out to a real-estate agent this summer to explore selling their Raleigh, N.C., house, which they bought in 2018. The agent said they could probably sell for at least $200,000 more than the $312,000 they paid. The couple decided to hold off until at least next year because home prices are high and they are reluctant to give up their 3.375% mortgage rate.  ""With home prices going up the way they are, if we sold our house, it would make a great profit, but we're going to eat up that profit in another home we're going to buy for a higher interest rate,"" Mr. McDuffie said.  In an analysis of four major metro areas -- Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington -- Redfin found that homeowners with mortgage rates below 3.5% were less likely to list their homes for sale in August compared with homeowners with higher rates.  Economists say it is difficult to predict how much the increase in mortgage rates could reduce home listings, because rates haven't climbed this rapidly in decades. The National Association of Realtors estimated that when mortgage rates increased in 2018, the existing-home inventory was 12% lower than it otherwise would have been.  ""I really don't see inventory rising,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. By NAR's measurement, which includes homes that are under contract, the supply of homes for sale at the end of August fell slightly from July.  Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said an analysis he did in 2016 of past periods of rising rates showed a decline in sales in which buyers' prior mortgage rates were more than 2 percentage points below their new mortgage rates. But there was no change if the difference between the rates was less than 2 percentage points.  Many sellers today have significant equity in their current homes, which can help them put down larger down payments on their new purchases to offset the effect of the higher interest rates. Those who are moving from high-cost markets to cheaper areas might also be less sensitive to higher rates, Mr. Khater said.  Still, about one-third of about 1,000 homeowners surveyed by John Burns Real Estate Consulting in July said they felt locked into their current homes due to rising rates.  Among the 197 homeowners who said they were saving to buy a home, only 15% said they would be willing to take on a new mortgage rate of 6% or higher, the survey showed.  Craig Young and Kathryn Cataldo hoped to sell their house in Huntsville, Ala., this summer, but they have pushed back their plans in response to the market slowdown.  ""I feel like we've missed the sweet spot in being able to sell our house, "" said Mr. Young, who is 64. They are not in a rush to move, but the house has a steep driveway that could become difficult for them to navigate as they age, he said.  ""If [mortgage rates] keep going up, I'm going to hang on,"" he said.

In an analysis of four major metro areas -- Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington -- Redfin found that homeowners with mortgage rates below 3.5% were less likely to list their homes for sale in August compared with homeowners with higher rates.  Economists say it is difficult to predict how much the increase in mortgage rates could reduce home listings, because rates haven't climbed this rapidly in decades. The National Association of Realtors estimated that when mortgage rates increased in 2018, the existing-home inventory was 12% lower than it otherwise would have been.  ""I really don't see inventory rising,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. By NAR's measurement, which includes homes that are under contract, the supply of homes for sale at the end of August fell slightly from July.  Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said an analysis he did in 2016 of past periods of rising rates showed a decline in sales in which buyers' prior mortgage rates were more than 2 percentage points below their new mortgage rates. But there was no change if the difference between the rates was less than 2 percentage points.  Many sellers today have significant equity in their current homes, which can help them put down larger down payments on their new purchases to offset the effect of the higher interest rates. Those who are moving from high-cost markets to cheaper areas might also be less sensitive to higher rates, Mr. Khater said.  Still, about one-third of about 1,000 homeowners surveyed by John Burns Real Estate Consulting in July said they felt locked into their current homes due to rising rates.  Among the 197 homeowners who said they were saving to buy a home, only 15% said they would be willing to take on a new mortgage rate of 6% or higher, the survey showed.  Craig Young and Kathryn Cataldo hoped to sell their house in Huntsville, Ala., this summer, but they have pushed back their plans in response to the market slowdown.  ""I feel like we've missed the sweet spot in being able to sell our house, "" said Mr. Young, who is 64. They are not in a rush to move, but the house has a steep driveway that could become difficult for them to navigate as they age, he said.  ""If [mortgage rates] keep going up, I'm going to hang on,"" he said.

282,665378,"Plenty of other legitimate moneymaking opportunities are out there for you to capitalize on at your convenience. Some are simply good for a fast buck, while others could turn into consistent streams of income after the holidays. Find out which cash-generating ideas could work best for you.  Be a Mystery Shopper  You can get paid up to $20 per shopping experience if you agree to shop at a store and provide detailed feedback on customer service, merchandise, and various quality-control metrics. Start by visiting the Mystery Shopping Providers Association's Web site to see a database of jobs with legitimate companies, and be sure to see the association's tips for avoiding mystery shopping scams.  Sell Unwanted Electronics  Don't leave smart phones, tablets, computers or game consoles you're no longer using in a desk drawer or the back of a closet. You can easily cash in on your unwanted electronics -- even damaged items -- by selling them online.  Sell used smart phones and Apple products at Gazelle.com and get paid by check, PayPal or an Amazon gift card. BuyMyTronics.com pays cash for smart phones, digital cameras, tablets, game consoles and more. You can sell smart phones, tablets, laptops and video games to NextWorth.com for cash or take items to one its partner stores, such as Target, and get store credit. At uSell, you can sell smart phones, tablets, game consoles, video games and textbooks. You get paid by check or through PayPal. Shipping with all of these sites is free.  If you want to buy electronics for a gift, however, check out our great gadget gifts of 2014.  Search for Unclaimed Property  Federal and state coffers hold billions of dollars' worth of unclaimed property. Some of it could be yours, but it's up to you to track down the cash.  The feds hang on to tax refunds that are returned to the IRS because of mailing-address errors or that are never claimed by taxpayers because they didn't file returns. The government also holds on to forgotten savings bonds, government-guaranteed mortgage-insurance refunds and government pensions that were never claimed. There's no central database, so you'll have to check with individual federal agencies about missing funds.  State governments hold onto uncashed dividend checks, returned utility deposits, unclaimed state-tax refunds and uncollected insurance benefits, among other things. (If a bank or other payer doesn't have your last known address on file, it will turn over your money to the state in which the institution is incorporated.) You can search for unclaimed property held by states at Unclaimed.org and Missingmoney.com.  Adjust Your Tax Withholding  If you got a big tax refund for 2013, you're not alone: The average refund is about $2,750 in 2014. Why wait until the spring to get the money you really need now? If you're a refund-receiving taxpayer, you've already overpaid your taxes via your initial 2014 paychecks -- banking at least a small refund next spring. Fix your tax withholding now to stop that refund from growing by delivering more of your money to you as you earn it.  Simply ask your company's payroll office for a W-4 form to claim extra allowances, and your take-home pay should rise on your next payday. To see how many allowances you should claim, try our easy-to-use withholding calculator.  Teach Lessons  If you have a special skill -- whether it's the ability to play an instrument well, paint like Picasso or explain calculus in a way anyone can understand -- you may be able to make money sharing it with others. For example, you could earn about $15 to $30 an hour tutoring individual kids or college students if you speak a second language or have great math, science or writing skills.  Or teach a full class. For example, stay-at-home mom Allison Millet, from Bowling Green, Ky., has transformed a passion for fitness into a business to help pay family medical bills. The certified fitness instructor created Backyard Bootcamp and charges $100 per student per six-week session.  Advertise your services on school, campus and community bulletin boards or on online classifieds site Craigslist. And take advantage of social media sites, such as Facebook, to let people know about the lessons you're able to teach.  Be a Tour Guide  If you know a lot about the city where you live, you may be able to profit from your knowledge by guiding tours -- especially during the holiday travel season. For example, travel guide site Vayable lets anyone list a tour or experience that tells a unique story about a destination - from its art to its history to its food -- and earn money from bookings through the site. U.S. tours that are promoted on Vayable -- such as a San Francisco street-art tour or a Washington, D.C., White House tour led by a member of the White House press corps -- range in price from about $25 per person to $200 per person, though more-upscale experiences are priced even higher. Vayable takes a 15% cut of whatever you choose to charge travelers and provides online tools to manage reservations, accept credit-card payments and securely communicate with customers.  Get Paid for Your Opinions  Market-research firms are hired by big businesses to get inside the heads of consumers. Participation in an in-person focus group led by a moderator, such as those run by Delve, can earn you between $50 and $200.  In exchange for taking online and phone surveys, firms such as Harris Interactive and Schlesinger Associates offer rewards points redeemable for gift cards and merchandise. Beware scams, though. Legitimate firms won't charge a fee or ask you to cash a check and wire back part of the money.  Lawyers are getting in on the act, too. ""Online jurors"" can earn cash for giving their opinions on legal cases. EJury.com pays $5 to $10 per case. You'll need a PayPal account. At OnlineVerdict.com, where fees start at $20, payment is made by check.  Sell Gold and Silver for Scrap  If you have gold jewelry that isn't valuable as an antique or a designer piece, consider selling it for scrap. Keep in mind that most gold jewelry isn't pure, say 14-karat or 18-karat, so you'll need to calculate the melt value to get a better sense of its worth as scrap. The melt value reflects the actual amount of gold in the jewelry; a dealer will offer you a percentage of that value. Quotes will vary widely, so get several. See Smart Ways to Sell Your Gold to learn more.  The same goes for silver. Maybe you inherited a few sterling trays you never use. Assuming the trays hold no particular value to collectors, sell them for scrap rather than trying to sell them at a consignment store or online. Check with several metals dealers, both online and at storefront locations, to get quotes. Expect to receive about 85% to 90% of your silver's melt value.  Sell Gently Worn Clothing  If you or your family members have brand-name clothing, accessories or shoes that are in good condition but no longer being used, turn them into quick cash by selling them on consignment. Research the consignment shops in your area to find the right match for the types and styles of clothing you have to sell. Most consignment stores will price items at one-third of their retail value, and you'll likely get 50% of the price at which your items eventually sell. To learn more, see How to Sell Clothes on Consignment.  You might be able to get more for your used clothes by selling them online. For example, you can earn up to 80% of the resale value of women's and kids' clothing, shoes and handbags at fashion resale site thredUP.com. If you have high-end men's and women's clothing, jewelry, watches and accessories, try your luck with luxury consignment site The RealReal. You earn up to 70% of the resale value in cash. Or skip the middle-man and sell your used clothing on eBay, which will require more effort on your part but could result in a bigger return.  Join a Street Team  The weather outside may be frightful, but street teams still need energetic, outgoing helpers to promote products, films, albums, events and more by handing out samples, interacting with people on the street, or dressing as mascots. To get a job earning $20 to $25 an hour, sign up with a company such as Street Team Promotion which handles promotions in big cities nationwide. Make sure you get a contract that specifies when you'll get paid.  Be a Babysitter  Babysitting can be a fun way to put money in your pocket if you like kids, and considering it's the season for holiday parties, you may be in high demand. In big cities such as New York and Washington, expect to earn up to $20 an hour as a babysitter or nanny. (In small and midsize cities, the going rate is closer to $7 to $10 an hour.) Advertise your services on Craigslist, community bulletin boards, the public library or houses of worship.  Sell Excess Furniture  If you have an attic, garage or storage unit filled with furniture you're not using, unload those items for cash by selling them on Craigslist. (You might even end up saving the monthly cost of your storage unit.) You can list large items (free) on your local Craigslist classifieds, and buyers will come to you. Just be sure to insist on cash to avoid bounced checks. Take good photos, share key details and provide a concise description of what you're selling.  If you don't want the hassle of selling items yourself, take furniture and home accessories you no longer want to an upscale consignment store that gets a lot of traffic so that you can get top dollar for your items. Expect to split the profit 50/50 with the store. For more information, see What to Sell -- And Not to Sell -- at Consignment Shops .  Sell Collectibles Online  Perhaps you collected baseball cards (or stamps or coins) when you were young, and now they're just collecting dust. But they might be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. One place to get top dollar for your collectibles and small items of value is eBay. Click on the ""register"" link in the top left corner of the homepage to create an account. Then visit the site's ""Seller Center"" to learn how to sell. You can list 50 items every month for free, and you'll pay a 10% fee on each item when it sells. Research prices for merchandise similar to what you plan to sell so that you can price your wares competitively. For more tips on how and where to sell valuable items, see 6 Things You Should Know About Collectibles.  Redeem Rewards Points  You could be sitting on an untapped source of cash if you haven't bothered to redeem your credit card rewards points lately. One-third of all rewards -- everything from airline miles to cash back -- worth a total of $16 billion go unredeemed each year, according to a study by marketing research firm Colloquy. Per household, that averages out to $205 worth of rewards a year that aren't redeemed.  The next-best thing to getting cash-for-points is a general-purpose gift card. At American Express, for example, 5,000 Membership Rewards points earns you a $25 AmEx gift card that's good in more than a million places. You can get more bang for your points by selecting a retailer-specific gift card -- often $50 for 5,000 points.  Sell Used Books  Stop letting your used books collect dust on a book shelf, and start selling them online. BookScouter.com makes it easy for you to get the best price for you books. Simply type in the ISBN from your book, and BookScouter.com scans prices from more than 40 book-buying sites to show you which ones are offering the most. For example, the highest price offered recently for a hardcover edition of The Goldfinch, which won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, was $8.75.  College textbooks can fetch a lot more. For example, some vendors recently were paying as much as $129 for Trigonometry by Ron Larson. Most other textbooks in good condition sell for $20 and up. ExtraBux.com, a price-comparison site, has found that Amazon.com offers the best buyback prices -- about 20% more than runnerup AbeBooks.com. (However, Amazon pays with gift cards only.) For more information, see Get the Best Price When Selling Back Textbooks.  Walk Dogs  Why not get a little exercise while you earn anywhere from $15 to $30 an hour? Working folks will pay plenty for you to take Rover or Scruffy on a daily stroll while they're at the office. Or consider pet-sitting for people while they're on vacation for a daily fee of $50 or more. Advertise your services in veterinarians' offices and on Craigslist. You can also team up with an existing dog-walking operation that handles client recruitment and scheduling. To find one, ask other dog walkers you encounter whether they're part of a group or check Craigslist.  Get Freelance Editorial Work  Sorry, Kiplinger.com isn't hiring. But plenty of media, corporate and nonprofit Web sites are looking for freelancers to write, edit or design content, for about $15 to $30 an hour. Freelancewriting.com and Freelance Writing Jobs provide a long list of freelance writing opportunities culled from several top sites. For $21 a month, you can join Mediabisto's freelance marketplace to post your qualifications and be contacted by media managers for work. Krop is a useful site for developers and designers; Freelance Photo Jobs consolidates listings for photographers; and DoNanza provides information on jobs for artists and other creators.  Sell Baked Goods  There are those who can bake. Then there are those who can't even make a cake from a mix without messing it up. They're the ones who have to rely on others to make the gingerbread men for their holiday party. If you can create tasty baked goods, then you can profit from others' lack of skills in the kitchen.  Laura Haley of Bowling Green, Ky., started making cupcakes as a way to keep herself occupied while staying with her dad when he was undergoing chemotherapy. She posted a picture of her cupcakes on Facebook and instantly received several orders from friends. Now she makes about $200 a month making cupcakes for others who hear about her through word of mouth or see pictures of her cupcakes on her Facebook page.  You also can find clients for your baked goods by volunteering to provide treats for your children's school functions or for church or other religious gatherings, or by selling them at a farmer's market, flea market or local festivals.  Participate in Clinical Trials  If you're willing to be a human guinea pig, you can pad your pockets by participating in clinical research trials. Compensation depends on the nature of the trial and the amount of time involved, but payment can range from $50 to more than $1,000, according to the Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation.  Legitimate studies are sponsored by medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies. You'll be required to undergo a health screening to determine if you're eligible to participate. Come-ons for clinical trials litter the Internet. Many are scams. The safe play is to peruse studies that are actively recruiting participants at ClinicalTrials.gov, a database run by the National Institutes of Health. Search by location to identify local trials.  Cash in On Unused Gift Cards  About $44 billion worth of gift cards has gone unused over the past six years, according to gift card resale site Gift Card Granny. So grab the unwanted cards you have lying around your house, and turn them into cash by selling them online at sites such as Gift Card Granny, Cardpool and Junkcard. You won't get the full value of your card (up to 92% at best). But if you have no intention of using the card, it's like getting free money. Cards for gas stations, grocery stores and retail chains (such as Exxon, Safeway and Walmart) often bring the best offers.

For example, travel guide site Vayable lets anyone list a tour or experience that tells a unique story about a destination - from its art to its history to its food -- and earn money from bookings through the site. U.S. tours that are promoted on Vayable -- such as a San Francisco street-art tour or a Washington, D.C., White House tour led by a member of the White House press corps -- range in price from about $25 per person to $200 per person, though more-upscale experiences are priced even higher. Vayable takes a 15% cut of whatever you choose to charge travelers and provides online tools to manage reservations, accept credit-card payments and securely communicate with customers.  Get Paid for Your Opinions  Market-research firms are hired by big businesses to get inside the heads of consumers. Participation in an in-person focus group led by a moderator, such as those run by Delve, can earn you between $50 and $200.  In exchange for taking online and phone surveys, firms such as Harris Interactive and Schlesinger Associates offer rewards points redeemable for gift cards and merchandise. Beware scams, though. Legitimate firms won't charge a fee or ask you to cash a check and wire back part of the money.  Lawyers are getting in on the act, too. ""Online jurors"" can earn cash for giving their opinions on legal cases. EJury.com pays $5 to $10 per case. You'll need a PayPal account. At OnlineVerdict.com, where fees start at $20, payment is made by check.  Sell Gold and Silver for Scrap  If you have gold jewelry that isn't valuable as an antique or a designer piece, consider selling it for scrap. Keep in mind that most gold jewelry isn't pure, say 14-karat or 18-karat, so you'll need to calculate the melt value to get a better sense of its worth as scrap. The melt value reflects the actual amount of gold in the jewelry; a dealer will offer you a percentage of that value. Quotes will vary widely, so get several. See Smart Ways to Sell Your Gold to learn more.  The same goes for silver. Maybe you inherited a few sterling trays you never use. Assuming the trays hold no particular value to collectors, sell them for scrap rather than trying to sell them at a consignment store or online. Check with several metals dealers, both online and at storefront locations, to get quotes. Expect to receive about 85% to 90% of your silver's melt value.  Sell Gently Worn Clothing  If you or your family members have brand-name clothing, accessories or shoes that are in good condition but no longer being used, turn them into quick cash by selling them on consignment. Research the consignment shops in your area to find the right match for the types and styles of clothing you have to sell. Most consignment stores will price items at one-third of their retail value, and you'll likely get 50% of the price at which your items eventually sell. To learn more, see How to Sell Clothes on Consignment.  You might be able to get more for your used clothes by selling them online. For example, you can earn up to 80% of the resale value of women's and kids' clothing, shoes and handbags at fashion resale site thredUP.com. If you have high-end men's and women's clothing, jewelry, watches and accessories, try your luck with luxury consignment site The RealReal. You earn up to 70% of the resale value in cash. Or skip the middle-man and sell your used clothing on eBay, which will require more effort on your part but could result in a bigger return.  Join a Street Team  The weather outside may be frightful, but street teams still need energetic, outgoing helpers to promote products, films, albums, events and more by handing out samples, interacting with people on the street, or dressing as mascots. To get a job earning $20 to $25 an hour, sign up with a company such as Street Team Promotion which handles promotions in big cities nationwide. Make sure you get a contract that specifies when you'll get paid.  Be a Babysitter  Babysitting can be a fun way to put money in your pocket if you like kids, and considering it's the season for holiday parties, you may be in high demand. In big cities such as New York and Washington, expect to earn up to $20 an hour as a babysitter or nanny. (In small and midsize cities, the going rate is closer to $7 to $10 an hour.) Advertise your services on Craigslist, community bulletin boards, the public library or houses of worship.  Sell Excess Furniture  If you have an attic, garage or storage unit filled with furniture you're not using, unload those items for cash by selling them on Craigslist. (You might even end up saving the monthly cost of your storage unit.) You can list large items (free) on your local Craigslist classifieds, and buyers will come to you. Just be sure to insist on cash to avoid bounced checks. Take good photos, share key details and provide a concise description of what you're selling.  If you don't want the hassle of selling items yourself, take furniture and home accessories you no longer want to an upscale consignment store that gets a lot of traffic so that you can get top dollar for your items. Expect to split the profit 50/50 with the store. For more information, see What to Sell -- And Not to Sell -- at Consignment Shops .  Sell Collectibles Online  Perhaps you collected baseball cards (or stamps or coins) when you were young, and now they're just collecting dust. But they might be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. One place to get top dollar for your collectibles and small items of value is eBay. Click on the ""register"" link in the top left corner of the homepage to create an account. Then visit the site's ""Seller Center"" to learn how to sell. You can list 50 items every month for free, and you'll pay a 10% fee on each item when it sells. Research prices for merchandise similar to what you plan to sell so that you can price your wares competitively. For more tips on how and where to sell valuable items, see 6 Things You Should Know About Collectibles.  Redeem Rewards Points  You could be sitting on an untapped source of cash if you haven't bothered to redeem your credit card rewards points lately. One-third of all rewards -- everything from airline miles to cash back -- worth a total of $16 billion go unredeemed each year, according to a study by marketing research firm Colloquy. Per household, that averages out to $205 worth of rewards a year that aren't redeemed.  The next-best thing to getting cash-for-points is a general-purpose gift card. At American Express, for example, 5,000 Membership Rewards points earns you a $25 AmEx gift card that's good in more than a million places. You can get more bang for your points by selecting a retailer-specific gift card -- often $50 for 5,000 points.  Sell Used Books  Stop letting your used books collect dust on a book shelf, and start selling them online. BookScouter.com makes it easy for you to get the best price for you books. Simply type in the ISBN from your book, and BookScouter.com scans prices from more than 40 book-buying sites to show you which ones are offering the most. For example, the highest price offered recently for a hardcover edition of The Goldfinch, which won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, was $8.75.  College textbooks can fetch a lot more. For example, some vendors recently were paying as much as $129 for Trigonometry by Ron Larson. Most other textbooks in good condition sell for $20 and up. ExtraBux.com, a price-comparison site, has found that Amazon.com offers the best buyback prices -- about 20% more than runnerup AbeBooks.com. (However, Amazon pays with gift cards only.) For more information, see Get the Best Price When Selling Back Textbooks.  Walk Dogs  Why not get a little exercise while you earn anywhere from $15 to $30 an hour? Working folks will pay plenty for you to take Rover or Scruffy on a daily stroll while they're at the office. Or consider pet-sitting for people while they're on vacation for a daily fee of $50 or more. Advertise your services in veterinarians' offices and on Craigslist. You can also team up with an existing dog-walking operation that handles client recruitment and scheduling. To find one, ask other dog walkers you encounter whether they're part of a group or check Craigslist.  Get Freelance Editorial Work  Sorry, Kiplinger.com isn't hiring. But plenty of media, corporate and nonprofit Web sites are looking for freelancers to write, edit or design content, for about $15 to $30 an hour. Freelancewriting.com and Freelance Writing Jobs provide a long list of freelance writing opportunities culled from several top sites. For $21 a month, you can join Mediabisto's freelance marketplace to post your qualifications and be contacted by media managers for work. Krop is a useful site for developers and designers; Freelance Photo Jobs consolidates listings for photographers; and DoNanza provides information on jobs for artists and other creators.  Sell Baked Goods  There are those who can bake. Then there are those who can't even make a cake from a mix without messing it up. They're the ones who have to rely on others to make the gingerbread men for their holiday party. If you can create tasty baked goods, then you can profit from others' lack of skills in the kitchen.  Laura Haley of Bowling Green, Ky., started making cupcakes as a way to keep herself occupied while staying with her dad when he was undergoing chemotherapy. She posted a picture of her cupcakes on Facebook and instantly received several orders from friends. Now she makes about $200 a month making cupcakes for others who hear about her through word of mouth or see pictures of her cupcakes on her Facebook page.  You also can find clients for your baked goods by volunteering to provide treats for your children's school functions or for church or other religious gatherings, or by selling them at a farmer's market, flea market or local festivals.  Participate in Clinical Trials  If you're willing to be a human guinea pig, you can pad your pockets by participating in clinical research trials. Compensation depends on the nature of the trial and the amount of time involved, but payment can range from $50 to more than $1,000, according to the Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation.  Legitimate studies are sponsored by medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies. You'll be required to undergo a health screening to determine if you're eligible to participate. Come-ons for clinical trials litter the Internet. Many are scams. The safe play is to peruse studies that are actively recruiting participants at ClinicalTrials.gov, a database run by the National Institutes of Health. Search by location to identify local trials.  Cash in On Unused Gift Cards  About $44 billion worth of gift cards has gone unused over the past six years, according to gift card resale site Gift Card Granny. So grab the unwanted cards you have lying around your house, and turn them into cash by selling them online at sites such as Gift Card Granny, Cardpool and Junkcard. You won't get the full value of your card (up to 92% at best). But if you have no intention of using the card, it's like getting free money. Cards for gas stations, grocery stores and retail chains (such as Exxon, Safeway and Walmart) often bring the best offers.  Copyright 2014 The Kiplinger Washington Editors"

284,375943,"However, mistakes can be avoided if testators (i.e. those making the will) and their advisers follow the correct procedures and take the prudent steps to mitigate the risk of such a challenge.  During their lifetime, there may be many reasons why a testator wishes to exclude a family member from their will. Therefore, while procuring the will it is imperative that advisers discuss in detail with the testator the reasons behind the proposed disinheritance.  Sign up for PA's Smarter Business Roadshow  In England and Wales, testators are not legally obliged to leave portions of their estates to certain people, as is the case in many other countries, and indeed there may be no pernicious intentions behind wanting to leave out a particular family member.  For instance, one of the intended beneficiaries may be more financially successful than another and consequently, the testator may feel that equal distributions are not suitable; or the testator may not be very close to their relatives or have had a serious or lasting falling-out, or perhaps they wish to leave the bulk of their estate to charity.  Contemporaneous notes  Whatever the thought process is, documenting their reasoning is crucial and ideally this should be done by retaining detailed contemporaneous notes of what the testator has said about their circumstances and their wishes at the time of writing their will.  Recording the testator's contemplations extends to them writing, in their own words, a letter of wishes which should be signed, dated and stored alongside the original will. A letter of wishes does not need to contain any legal jargon but should be written in clear and accurate terms. If a dispute should sadly arise later on, a letter of wishes - while not being legally binding - is persuasive evidence of the testator's mind-set when they wrote the will and why they envisaged their estate would devolve in a certain way.  At the same time they put their wishes to paper, the testator should be encouraged to speak to their family, if they are able to do so, about what their intentions are. A shock from the blue for a grieving relative to discover that they have been disinherited is far more likely to produce an emotional reaction and potentially unpleasant, costly legal consequences. If they have the time to process a testator's wishes, they are far less likely to bring a claim against the estate after that person has died. Clearly such conversations may be taxing for all involved but could drastically reduce the risk of conflict down the line.  Disinheritance aside, reducing the potential for any post-death challenge to a will extends to the more routine aspects of the will-writing process.  Ticking all the boxes  There are strict legal requirements to bring a will into being: it must be in writing, signed by the testator, the testator must have intended to make the will, and the testator's signature must be witnessed by two independent adults.  As to the latter, ‘independent' means that a beneficiary or the beneficiary's spouse/civil partner cannot take on this role. If a witness falls into either category, then the gift to that person is void. The witnesses do not need to know the contents of the will, but they must know it is a will and should sign it. It is inadvisable to let any family member act as a witness, even if they do not stand to inherit anything under the will.  Although technically a will is valid if it has not been dated, it is highly advisable to ensure that the will is dated on the day which the testator signs so that it is clear on their death that the will submitted to the Probate Registry is in fact the last will they made. This is particularly the case if the testator has written previous wills.  Advisers should further ensure when the will is drafted and signed that the involvement of a beneficiary is minimal (and ideally non-existent) in case they are exerting undue influence on the testator. Care should be taken to confirm the testator's unaided and full approval and actual wishes. If nothing untoward is happening then a beneficiary should not take umbrage with, say, being asked to leave the room while the testator gives their instructions and/or executes their will. If proven that the testator was coerced into signing a will then it will likely be set aside.  Lastly, the testator must have mental capacity when the will is made. If they do not, the will is invalid. This is perhaps a trickier topic for advisers to raise with their clients, however, if there is any doubt over the individual's capability to make sound decisions, or if they are very elderly, or if the adviser is aware of prior mental illnesses or losses of capacity, then they ought to suggest that the testator obtains a capacity assessment.  An assessment can be carried out by the testator's GP/nurse, social worker or another medical professional such as their consultant or occupational therapist.

287,328569," Of the program total on the Big Board, 22.8% involved stock-index arbitrage, unchanged from the prior week. In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.    Some 60.2% of program trading was executed by firms for their customers, while 38% was done for their own accounts, or principal trading. Another 1.8% was designated as customer facilitation, in which firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades.    The report includes a profile of trading whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves 50 points or more in a single direction during any one-hour period.

NEW YORK -- Program trading in the week ended July 5 accounted for
10.5%, or a daily average of 32.8 million shares, of New York Stock
Exchange volume.



Brokerage firms executed an additional 27.6 million shares daily of
program trading away from the Big Board, mostly on foreign markets.
Program trading is the simultaneous purchase or sale of at least 15
different stocks with a total value of $1 million or more.

 Of the program total on the Big Board, 22.8% involved stock-index arbitrage, unchanged from the prior week. In this strategy, traders dart between stocks and stock-index options and futures to capture fleeting price differences.    Some 60.2% of program trading was executed by firms for their customers, while 38% was done for their own accounts, or principal trading. Another 1.8% was designated as customer facilitation, in which firms use principal positions to facilitate customer trades.    The report includes a profile of trading whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves 50 points or more in a single direction during any one-hour period. There was one such period for this week.    The period occurred Friday, July 5, when the Dow industrials opened down more than 50 points.

Firstly, you need to decide who your executors are. An executor can be your spouse, a friend or relative or your children if they are adults.

This would be where everything is left to the spouse and then, when both parents are gone, everything is left equally to the children.

If we automatically administer the step-up for Select Guaranteed Income Benefit, Guaranteed Income Benefit (Managed Risk and version 4) or step-up period election (versions 2 or 3) for you and your charge rate is increased, you may ask us to reverse the step-up or the step-up period election by giving us notice within 30 days after the date on which the step-up or the step-up period election occurred. If we receive notice of your request to reverse the step-up or step-up period election, on a going forward basis, we will decrease the charge rate to the charge rate in effect before the step-up or the step-up period election occurred.

For version 2 and version 3, you will have no more step-ups unless you notify us that you wish to start a new step-up period (described in the i4LIFE®Advantage section of this prospectus). For Select Guaranteed Income Benefit and Guaranteed Income Benefit (Managed Risk and version 4), future step-ups will continue even after you decline a current step-up. We will provide you with written notice when a step-up has resulted in an increase to the current charge rate so that you may give us timely notice if you wish to reverse a step-up. You may contact us in writing or by telephone (if you have proper authorization for telephone transactions in place).

403,646008,"On Tuesday, Justice Department attorneys alerted the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit — which is weighing an injunction against the forgiveness plan — to a letter MOHELA sent Bush last week clarifying that it played no role in the decision by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) to sue.  ""The only communications between MOHELA and [the Missouri attorney general's office] as it relates to student debt relief, is that the Office recently filed a series of sunshine law requests on MOHELA seeking copies of documents relative to MOHELA's federal loan servicing contract,"" the company wrote in its letter to Bush.  The lawsuit filed by Schmitt and leaders in the other five states said MOHELA, which owns and services debt from the defunct Federal Family Education Loan program, would be deprived of interest payments if borrowers consolidated out of FFEL to take advantage of Biden's forgiveness plan. It said the company, which funds state scholarships, would also lose revenue from servicing Direct Loans — those made and owned by the federal government — that are wiped away.  ""Because Missouri has declared that MOHELA's support for higher education in the State furthers an essential public function this undeniably harms the State."" The letter ""tacitly accepts that MOHELA's revenue is a function of the loans it services as the States have said,"" attorneys for Missouri and Nebraska said in a court filing Wednesday.  Bush had asked MOHELA whether the company is supporting efforts to block Biden's plan to preserve its profits. In response, MOHELA said it is ""faithfully fulfilling its obligations pursuant to its federal loan servicing contract.""  The company said it is ""a public instrumentality of the state. As a governmental entity, it does not have shareholders and does not exist to make profits. Any available funds above reasonable operating needs and reserves are devoted by MOHELA to student financial aid.""  In their case, the states argued that Missouri had a right to sue on MOHELA's behalf because it ""performs 'an essential public function'"" and ""its board is comprised of public officials and people appointed by the governor.""  U.S. District Judge Henry E. Autrey, who dismissed the states' case for lack of standing, questioned that premise. Autrey said that while the governor does appoint five members of the company's board, its revenue and liabilities are independent of the state.  The states appealed, sending it to the 8th circuit. The court issued an administrative stay last month temporarily barring the Education Department from discharging any debt under the new forgiveness program.  While Justice attorneys say MOHELA's letter bolsters the lower court ruling, the states believe it actually strengthens their case, according to Wednesday's court filing. The attorneys for Missouri and Nebraska said MOHELA has affirmed itself as a government entity whose earnings are used to support state endeavors.  ""Harming MOHELA's finances reduces money that MOHELA uses to originate loans for Missouri students, fund financial aid programs of the Missouri Department of Higher Education and Workforce Development, and contribute to Missouri's Lewis and Clark Discovery Fund,"" the state attorneys argue.  Until now, MOHELA has remained silent on the states' lawsuit. The company did not respond to requests for further comment on Wednesday.  MOHELA is the primary servicer for borrowers pursuing Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a federal program for teachers, firefighters and other public servants. The company services roughly $59 billion in federal direct loans as well as loans from the defunct FFEL program, according to court filings.  In the wake of the states' lawsuit, the American Federation of Teachers and the nonprofit Student Borrowers Protection Center last month sent MOHELA a cease-and-desist letter. The group's accused the company of violating California's Student Borrower Bill of Rights, which prohibits student loan servicers from interfering with borrowers' rights to loan forgiveness. The Student Borrowers Protection Center said it was prepared to take legal action if the company failed to stand down on the lawsuit.  On Wednesday, SBPC executive director Mike Pierce said: ""It appears that these states just got caught misleading a federal appellate court in a ham-fisted effort to score political points against the president.

406,1237094,"A Sunday Times investigation has discovered that due to a quirk in the compensation rules, more than 82,000 pensioners are being denied a full annual rise, with almost half suffering completely frozen payments in retirement.  Peter Sellers from Saddleworth in Oldham, Greater Manchester, worked for the construction group Dew Pitchmastic (formerly G Dew & Co) for 46 years. It was written into the terms of his pension scheme that he would receive 3% annual uplifts when he retired, to help keep pace with inflation. But after his scheme tipped into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) in 2010, he was shocked to find he would not receive any increases.""This freezing of the annual rise is unfairly and unjustly directed at older and the most vulnerable members only,"" he said. The 82-year-old called the rules, which are imposed on the PPF by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), ""draconian"" and ""distressing"".  The PPF was set up in 2005 to offer protection to members of generous defined-benefit schemes — which include final salary and career average plans — that are underfunded and whose employers are facing insolvency. So far, 754 schemes have been transferred to the PPF; some of the largest include UK Coal (July 2013) and Monarch Airlines (October 2014). Scheme members who are already receiving a pension typically enjoy 100% compensation from the PPF, with no upper limit. Those who have not yet retired, or who retired before reaching their scheme's normal pension age when their employer went bust, generally receive 90% of their pension. This is subject to a cap — currently £36,401 a year at the age of 65 (£32,761 when the 90% level is applied).  However, while pensioners continue to enjoy the same payments they received before their old employer went bust, they also suffer from a rule that means their pension may not increase each year.  Pension benefits built up from employment before April 1997 are not raised annually. This is because, before this date, schemes were not required by law to make inflation-related increases to pensions in payment, and, says the government, applying the same criterion to the PPF helps ensure that compensation does not exceed what the scheme would have originally provided.  According to a response to a Freedom of Information request, 82,201 PPF members have pre-1997 service, of whom 37,903 have pensions that were accrued only before April 1997. Their payments are frozen; those with a mix of pre and post-1997 work will have their annual uplifts reduced.  The uplift for pensionable service from April 2007 is based on inflation, subject to a maximum of 2.5% a year. For example, if a member received £12,000 a year from the PPF in 2010 and was not allowed annual increases, they would have lost more than £300 a year since then if the full 2.5% rise had been applied, and a total loss to date of £1,254.  Sellers is fighting to get the PPF rules changed. ""I recently heard of a quarry manager with my old company who, prior to his death at 87 in 2013, was upset at his treatment after many years of loyal service and concerned about the reduced and frozen pension he was leaving for his wife,"" he said.  Sellers took his pension from Dew in 1994 and, after setting up his own company, only fully retired in 2013. Over the past three years he has written to the PPF, the pensions minister Steve Webb, his own MP, Debbie Abrahams, as well as Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, to highlight ""blatant age discrimination"".  Faith Dickson, a partner at the pensions law firm Sackers, said: ""I always thought the PPF could be age discriminatory because the compensation system affects different age groups disproportionately. The PPF thinks it is protecting older members as they get 100% of their pensions if they are already retired, but many don't get annual increases.""  The DWP said: ""PPF compensation is increased in line with the legislation that applied to a member's original pension. Entitlement to indexation of compensation is not based on someone's age.""  Webb announced last summer that PPF members, who have not yet retired and belonged to a pension scheme for more than 20 years, would see annual limits increase 3% for every year of service after this landmark, up to a maximum of £63,000. The change has not yet come into effect.  The PPF has a surplus of £2.4bn. It is funded by a levy on pension schemes but hopes to be self-sufficient by 2030.","Government rules punish many whose old employers went bust. Ruth Emery reports

The PPF was set up in 2005 to offer protection to members of generous defined-benefit schemes — which include final salary and career average plans — that are underfunded and whose employers are facing insolvency. So far, 754 schemes have been transferred to the PPF; some of the largest include UK Coal (July 2013) and Monarch Airlines (October 2014). Scheme members who are already receiving a pension typically enjoy 100% compensation from the PPF, with no upper limit. Those who have not yet retired, or who retired before reaching their scheme's normal pension age when their employer went bust, generally receive 90% of their pension. This is subject to a cap — currently £36,401 a year at the age of 65 (£32,761 when the 90% level is applied).  However, while pensioners continue to enjoy the same payments they received before their old employer went bust, they also suffer from a rule that means their pension may not increase each year.  Pension benefits built up from employment before April 1997 are not raised annually. This is because, before this date, schemes were not required by law to make inflation-related increases to pensions in payment, and, says the government, applying the same criterion to the PPF helps ensure that compensation does not exceed what the scheme would have originally provided.  According to a response to a Freedom of Information request, 82,201 PPF members have pre-1997 service, of whom 37,903 have pensions that were accrued only before April 1997. Their payments are frozen; those with a mix of pre and post-1997 work will have their annual uplifts reduced.  The uplift for pensionable service from April 2007 is based on inflation, subject to a maximum of 2.5% a year. For example, if a member received £12,000 a year from the PPF in 2010 and was not allowed annual increases, they would have lost more than £300 a year since then if the full 2.5% rise had been applied, and a total loss to date of £1,254.  Sellers is fighting to get the PPF rules changed. ""I recently heard of a quarry manager with my old company who, prior to his death at 87 in 2013, was upset at his treatment after many years of loyal service and concerned about the reduced and frozen pension he was leaving for his wife,"" he said.  Sellers took his pension from Dew in 1994 and, after setting up his own company, only fully retired in 2013. Over the past three years he has written to the PPF, the pensions minister Steve Webb, his own MP, Debbie Abrahams, as well as Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, to highlight ""blatant age discrimination"".  Faith Dickson, a partner at the pensions law firm Sackers, said: ""I always thought the PPF could be age discriminatory because the compensation system affects different age groups disproportionately. The PPF thinks it is protecting older members as they get 100% of their pensions if they are already retired, but many don't get annual increases.""  The DWP said: ""PPF compensation is increased in line with the legislation that applied to a member's original pension. Entitlement to indexation of compensation is not based on someone's age.""  Webb announced last summer that PPF members, who have not yet retired and belonged to a pension scheme for more than 20 years, would see annual limits increase 3% for every year of service after this landmark, up to a maximum of £63,000. The change has not yet come into effect.  The PPF has a surplus of £2.4bn. It is funded by a levy on pension schemes but hopes to be self-sufficient by 2030."

Pottawattamie County voters approved their local-option sales tax by an 18-point margin in 2001. In 2003, voters approved it by 36 points in Harrison County and a whopping 60 points in Mills County.  Fast-forward to 2017, and the program's aim of having modern amenities for Iowa's students is clearly met. As our reporters visit southwest Iowa's many school facilities, none are dilapidated, and most are great buildings.  Maintaining that investment, though, as well as improving those facilities that are subpar, requires continuing to fund the program helping to keep our schools — physically, anyway — in top shape. The alternative, seen in other states, would be to shift those expenses back onto property taxpayers and, likely, inviting schools to allow those facilities to decline past the point of disrepair before the need for a bond issue becomes undeniable.  Our students deserve better, and frankly so do our taxpayers.  Giving schools a reliable source of income — which they can either save up as Lewis Central does or bond against to get needed work done using low interest rates like Council Bluffs has done — allows them to keep facilities in good shape and make infrastructure investments when it is best for students, and before repairs become too costly.  Looking around the region, we see plenty of bond issues in the metropolitan area, but they are a much rarer occurrence in southwest Iowa — and that's because of SAVE as well as physical plant and equipment levy funding.  In communities such as ours, allowing Nebraska residents to help pay for our schools, as well as those otherwise not directly paying property taxes, helps to spread the cost around, too.  Property taxes are, of course, an important means of paying for the common good in our community. But not everything needs to come from local property taxes, and the statewide 1 cent levy to support schools is smart policy.

408,795466,"In the chaos of the smoke, Karl Karlsen had managed to rescue his three young children – his two daughters and son, Levi. But Karlsen’s wife Christina, 30, was trapped in a bathroom behind a securely boarded-up window that she couldn’t break through.  The heat was too fierce for Karlsen to go back in and she perished in the fire in the house she’d lovingly made a home. Young mum Christina had died of smoke inhalation as she’d cowered terrified in the bathtub with only a washcloth over her mouth for protection. It was a tragedy that would haunt the community.  The fire had seemingly started because of a string of very unfortunate coincidences. Karlsen, who worked for Christina’s dad’s air conditioning and heating business, explained his wife had broken the bathroom window a few days earlier, which explained why it was boarded up with plywood from the outside, preventing her escape.  She’d also left a jug of flammable kerosene in the hallway outside the bathroom thinking it was water – which had been accidentally knocked over. Then a faulty electric light had been placed too close to the carpet, which ignited the blaze.  Firefighters ruled the fire accidental and Karlsen faced life as a single parent. Luckily, just 20 days before the house fire, Karlsen had taken out a life insurance policy on Christina which paid him $200,000.  The widower was able to use the money to move back to his hometown in Varick, New York, buy a house and start his life again. Seemingly, Karlsen was so broken with grief, he didn’t even wait for Christina’s funeral – he left after the fire.  A year later, Karlsen met Cindy Best and they married in 1993. Cindy felt enormous sympathy for the man who had been forced to watch his wife die in such a horrific way.  She cared for Karlsen’s children and they went on to have a son. They built a new life together on a quiet detached farm. But then tragedy struck again 17 years after the fire that claimed Christina.  In 2008, Karlsen’s son Levi, then a 23-year-old divorced father of two was doing a favour for his dad on the farm, looking at an old Chevy pick-up truck that needed some repairs.  It was November 20, and Karlsen and Cindy were at the funeral of a relative. When they returned, they found Levi crushed under the fallen vehicle. He’d been working underneath the truck, that had been propped up with a jack.  The front wheels had been removed and with no safety blocks supporting it, when the jack had broken, it had crushed Levi. Karlsen shouted at Cindy to call 911, but it was too late. his son was dead.  In his grief, Karlsen commented to friends that he couldn’t believe that one man could have so much bad luck in his life. There had also been a fire on his farm in 2002, that had claimed the lives of some prized Belgian horses. Karl had been compensated with an $80,000 insurance payment.  Incredibly, on the day of his death, Levi had signed a will that had left his entire estate – and his life insurance payout – to his dad. So again, Karlsen was in line for a large sum of money. Levi’s death was ruled an accident and Karlsen received $700,000.  Over the next few years, Karlsen’s second wife Cindy started to feel unsettled about how her husband had seemingly done very well out of a string of tragedies.  Could one man really be so lucky It seemed suspicious that Karlsen had profited so greatly from a policy that Levi had signed the very same day he’d died. That seemed too much of a coincidence. Had Karlsen played a part in Levi’s death Surely, it was unthinkable.  Cindy hired a private detective to look into Karlsen’s activities and discovered he was investing some of the payout he’d received from Levi’s death into a life insurance policy on her own life. A policy worth a huge $1.2 million.  Terrified for her safety, she took their son and fled to stay with family. Cindy told police her suspicions about Levi, and she agreed to have her conversations with Karlsen recorded.  Over a lunch in November 2012, Cindy questioned her estranged husband and urged him to tell the truth about Levi. Karlsen confessed that he’d been involved in his death. Police brought him in for questioning.  At first, Karlsen said he’d been there but it was an accident – but it was far from that. Then gradually, Karlsen admitted that the day Levi had died, he’d taken his son to a bank where a witness saw Levi sign a will naming his dad as sole beneficiary. After signing the papers, Karlsen had asked Levi to stop by the farm and look at the truck that needed repairs.  With Levi under the vehicle, Karlsen had got into the truck’s front cab, causing it to collapse onto his son. As Levi cried out in agony, Karlsen turned up the volume on the radio to drown out the sounds. Then he’d left to join Cindy at the funeral – returning four hours later to ‘discover’ his son.  Karlsen was charged with second degree murder. Right up until his 2013 trial, he insisted it had been an accident but then he pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. He admitted he’d allowed his son to be crushed to death under a truck.  In December 2013, he was sentenced to life in prison and told he would serve a minimum of 15 years.  But the case wasn’t closed. Karlsen’s conviction raised some troubling questions about the death of his first wife, Christina, in 1991. Was it an accident after all The police investigation in California was reopened.  The insurance policy on Christina’s life was taken out just 19 days before she died. A fact that matched Levi’s case. The boarded-up window stopping her escape seemed to be perfect timing. Not to mention the kerosene that had conveniently spilt on the carpet, close to a faulty light.  Daughter Erin said that she and her late brother Levi had long held the belief that their dad was involved in the death of their mum. Saying that as the house burnt, Karlsen ‘just stood there’ and didn’t try to save his wife.  Karlsen was extradited to California for his trial this year. The prosecution said he had killed Christina for financial gain. Nearly three decades later, the jury found Karlsen, now 60, guilty of first-degree murder.  Christina’s mother, Arlene Meltzer, 78, was in the courtroom when the verdict was read by the jury. ‘I just knew that he had something to do with it,’ she said. ‘It is something a mother always carries in their heart.’  Karlsen was sentenced to life in prison with no possibility of parole. He was told he would serve the sentences consecutively – finishing his time in New York for Levi’s death, before coming to California for his second sentence.  The acts of Karlsen beggar belief. He allowed his wife and mother of his children to die in agony and then crushed his son under a truck. Karlsen wanted to get rich and he made sure that happened, no matter what it took.","Karl Karlsen of Murphys, California, got millions in insurance after his wife Christina died in a horrific house fire and their son was killed repairing a vehicle -but second wife Cindy started to get suspicious when she discovered a policy in her name

410,761174,"The ranks of the BRW Rich List invest in anything from cattle stations in the Pilbara to industrial warehouses in suburban Melbourne. Harold Mitchell, executive chairman of Aegis Media Pacific, is thinking long term about his investment in two cattle stations in Western Australia's Pilbara region with West Australian Newspapers director Doug Flynn.  ""I've got five grandchildren under the age of seven and I definitely would like to see them own it,"" he said earlier this year.  Mitchell, who has made his fortune as Australia's most powerful media buyer, sees the stations as a strategic export investment, citing their proximity to the fast-growing Asian economies.  London-based hedge fund manager Michael Hintze also has extensive rural investments. He has spent more than $120 million buying holdings along the eastern seaboard of Australia in just over two years.  Others prefer to keep their investments closer to the city and have become property developers in their own right. Paul Little will step down as chief executive of transport and logistics outfit Toll Holdings early next year, which will give him more time for his burgeoning property development company Little Projects. It has more than $600 million worth of apartment projects planned or under way in inner-city Melbourne and is undertaking land subdivisions in the city's outer suburbs.  Little says he has always been passionate about investing in property and likes the long-term fundamentals of the sector, particularly in Melbourne. Much of the funding for Little Projects came from the sale of Little's Asciano shares, required by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission when Toll spun off Asciano in 2007.  Reg Rowe, the founder of Super Retail Group (formerly Super Cheap Auto), is another who is active in the residential property sector. He has formed Excel Development Group with business partner and former Urban Development Institute of Australia president Peter Sherrie. Excel has several land subdivision projects in south-east Queensland, plus a string of retail and home furnishing centres, office and industrial projects.  Ian McMullin, the founder of Melbourne industrial company Spotless Group, and his family have extensive industrial property investments in suburban Melbourne. His private McMullin Group has investments in business and industrial parks and home furnishing retail centres, as well as aged-care facilities, medical centres and self-storage centres.  Hotels are another popular investment. Mining magnate Clive Palmer paid $80 million for the Hyatt Regency Coolum resort on the Sunshine Coast earlier this year, after which he paid $7 million for two Gold Coast golf courses.  Then there are pubs.

Be it a Pilbara cattle station or an industrial facility on the urban fringe, property is the investment of choice.

They may be high-flying entrepreneurs who risk all to make their fortune in business. But when it comes to protecting their wealth, most of Australia's richest people are conservative and park their money in property. They do, however, invest in a wide array of property sectors – besides their expensive and expansive mansions.
The ranks of the BRW Rich List invest in anything from cattle stations in the Pilbara to industrial warehouses in suburban Melbourne. Harold Mitchell, executive chairman of Aegis Media Pacific, is thinking long term about his investment in two cattle stations in Western Australia's Pilbara region with West Australian Newspapers director Doug Flynn.  ""I've got five grandchildren under the age of seven and I definitely would like to see them own it,"" he said earlier this year.  Mitchell, who has made his fortune as Australia's most powerful media buyer, sees the stations as a strategic export investment, citing their proximity to the fast-growing Asian economies.  London-based hedge fund manager Michael Hintze also has extensive rural investments. He has spent more than $120 million buying holdings along the eastern seaboard of Australia in just over two years.  Others prefer to keep their investments closer to the city and have become property developers in their own right. Paul Little will step down as chief executive of transport and logistics outfit Toll Holdings early next year, which will give him more time for his burgeoning property development company Little Projects. It has more than $600 million worth of apartment projects planned or under way in inner-city Melbourne and is undertaking land subdivisions in the city's outer suburbs.  Little says he has always been passionate about investing in property and likes the long-term fundamentals of the sector, particularly in Melbourne. Much of the funding for Little Projects came from the sale of Little's Asciano shares, required by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission when Toll spun off Asciano in 2007.  Reg Rowe, the founder of Super Retail Group (formerly Super Cheap Auto), is another who is active in the residential property sector. He has formed Excel Development Group with business partner and former Urban Development Institute of Australia president Peter Sherrie. Excel has several land subdivision projects in south-east Queensland, plus a string of retail and home furnishing centres, office and industrial projects.  Ian McMullin, the founder of Melbourne industrial company Spotless Group, and his family have extensive industrial property investments in suburban Melbourne. His private McMullin Group has investments in business and industrial parks and home furnishing retail centres, as well as aged-care facilities, medical centres and self-storage centres.  Hotels are another popular investment. Mining magnate Clive Palmer paid $80 million for the Hyatt Regency Coolum resort on the Sunshine Coast earlier this year, after which he paid $7 million for two Gold Coast golf courses.  Then there are pubs. With many owners in the sector struggling under the weight of heavy debts, Rich Listers such as advertising identity John Singleton and retailer Gerry Harvey in Sydney and Computershare founder Chris Morris in Melbourne have jumped into the sector and bought pubs at bargain prices.

414,659648,"I t's no secret that Americans struggle to save for retirement, and the second worst recession in the past 100 years made the task even more difficult.  The consequences could be staggering if the nation doesn't find a way to get more people back on a plausible financial track for their post-working years. But heading down the wrong path could be even more devastating. That's something advocates and lawmakers should think about before rushing to attack a problem that will take decades to solve.  Oregon is among a handful of states considering legislation that would inject the state into retirement planning. California has moved farthest along that path, last year passing the California Secure Choice Retirement Service Trust Act. The bill seeks to require most private companies to make retirement savings plans available to employees, though it is subject to a host of conditions that could take months, if not years, to meet.  In Oregon, Rep. Jules Bailey, D-Portland, is leading an effort to increase workers' retirement-plan choices. House Bill 3436 would create a study group to look at options. Among the possibilities: a California-style approach requiring all but the smallest private employers to offer retirement plans, possibly with automatic payroll deductions, or something modeled after 529 college savings plans.  There's no harm in creating a study group, but if HB3436 moves forward, it must do so in a way that doesn't create unrealistic expectations or burden small businesses with liability. If, as advocates say, retirement planning is too complicated for many workers to handle, how are small businesses supposed to do any better?  David John, senior strategic policy adviser with AARP's Public Policy Institute and a longtime advocate of automatic-deduction IRAs, acknowledges the challenges small businesses face. ""Small employers are so invested in the day-to-day activities, they frankly don't have the time to open a plan,"" he said in a meeting with The Oregonian editorial board.  John and others envision a program where most businesses would be required to offer retirement plans, with deductions automatically made from paychecks unless employees opted out. State government would have a role in setting up those plans to limit the burden on businesses. The trickier part is how to limit the liability should investments fall short of expectations.  A 529-style plan, where the state makes a program available and individuals decide whether to participate, is a better idea than a heavy-handed approach that creates a new mandate for businesses. But if the Legislature is serious about helping more Oregonians achieve a secure retirement, they should consider these two issues first.  * Job creation. The most basic reason Americans don't save is because they don't have enough money. Requiring employers to offer retirement plans would do nothing to help the 8 percent of Oregonians, a number still above the 7.5 percent national rate, who are unemployed. Also, most part-time workers lack access to retirement plans.  * Financial education. Retirement planning intimidates many Americans. So do many other financial issues. Managing money effectively is too essential to surviving today's economy for public schools to punt on the subject. Young adults need to enter the workforce prepared to make good financial decisions.  ""If you don't change the culture, you're not going to solve the problem,"" said Gene Derfler, a former Oregon legislator who now represents chambers of commerce in the state.  Derfler is right. Persuading more people to make savings a priority is the biggest challenge to retirement security --no matter what the government does to help.  Inadequate retirement income is not a new problem. In fact, there never has been a time when a majority of retirees received income from private and/or public pensions, Nevin Adams, director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute, told the Motley Fool investment site. The number or retirees with pension income peaked at less than 40 percent in the early '90s.  The attention being directed at retirement planning is overdue.

418,438730,"Vulnerable individuals - often widows and widowers - may be incapable of understanding the financial consequences of marrying again. Some are even unaware they have done so.  The problem is so serious that families, lawyers and politicians are fighting for changes in the law to safeguard the ever growing number of dementia sufferers - in a campaign now backed by The Mail on Sunday. Labour MP Fabian Hamilton has introduced a private member's Bill seeking to protect vulnerable adults entering a marriage contract. The Bill is due to get its second reading next month.  Hamilton's call for change comes after he learned of the distressing fate of former constituent Joan Blass who died nearly three years ago. She was a 91-year-old widow with severe dementia who ended up marrying a self-appointed live-in carer 23 years her junior.  Only after Joan's death in 2016 did her family discover she had married. This meant the will that Joan had created while of sound mind in 2004 was no longer valid. Instead she was deemed to have died without a will - resulting in her new husband being the beneficiary of her £210,000 estate rather than her two children.  Last week, Joan's daughter Daphne Franks, 62, told The Mail on Sunday the family had endured a 'hideous' ordeal. She was close to her mother both emotionally and physically - they lived in neighbouring homes in Leeds. Daphne, a university teacher, even held power of attorney which gave her legal authority to act on her mother's financial behalf. But this was of no use when it came to preventing the marriage or preserving Joan's original wishes.  Daphne says: 'My mum's partner described himself as her carer but he was just a man who moved into her house. He has made a lot of money as a result.' She adds: 'It sounds far-fetched but our awful situation is not a one-off. Grooming of the elderly is happening more than people realise. Unless we get the law changed this problem will get worse.'  The Mail on Sunday has now learned of other similarly worrying cases.  This includes a man in his eighties with severe dementia - who had lost the capacity even to speak - getting married to a partner.  A first attempt by the partner to wed was thwarted by the man's son from his first marriage, whom he managed to phone. Days later, a second attempt was successful. As a result, his will was revoked and his new wife became the main beneficiary of his estate.  In another case, a dementia-sufferer was whisked away to New Zealand by his partner to be married without his family's knowledge or blessing.  Alistair Spencer works for law firm Shakespeare Martineau. He says: 'I have come across situations like this a few times, where a younger person manages to marry someone with dementia and then inherit their estate.' He adds: 'Unless a formal capacity assessment has been conducted by a medical professional, a person is assumed to have the capacity to enter a marriage.' Spencer says one case he worked on involved a woman who held such sway over her partner that she managed to prevent a professional assessment of his mental capacity taking place. She distanced him from his family and married him. Spencer's firm managed to get the will overturned.  Arshoo Singh, from law firm Blake Morgan, says: 'Many people don't realise that when someone gets married an existing will is automatically revoked.' She assisted the children of an 81-year-old man with dementia who were trying to prevent a marriage to his 60-year-old partner. The pair met when she became his professional carer.  Singh says: 'Even though his Alzheimer's had progressed, he passed the test for entering a marriage. But when the psychiatrist asked about his will, he forgot he had one and became confused about his finances.'  His relatives did accept the couple were in a genuine relationship and that she took care of their father. But they applied to the Court of Protection for a 'statutory will', which allows families to make a will on behalf of someone who is mentally unable to act themselves.  Ultimately it was agreed the children would still inherit but a portion of wealth would also be reserved for the new wife.  Singh adds: 'Don't leave these issues until after someone has died. It becomes harder to sort out and the costs are high. I see how painful these cases are both financially and emotionally.' MP Hamilton is asking for four crucial changes to the law.  First, that marriage does not automatically revoke a will. Second, better training and more robust procedures for registrars performing a wedding so they spot any warning signs. Thirdly for questionnaires to establish both parties have the capacity to enter a marriage.

419,350393," Ian Stuttard of The Royal Bank of Scotland offers his TOP TEN TIPS for financial fitness:    1. Re-mortgage    Your mortgage is one of the bills which has the biggest effect on the domestic budget. Look at the deals on offer for people who want to re-mortgage, with fixed, flexible and discounted products available. For example, a customer with a typical A#75,000 25-year capital repayment mortgage could expect to save up to A#120 per month against the standard variable rate if they switch to a discounted product with 3% off the standard variable rate.    2. Make overpayments on your mortgage    By overpaying on a flexible mortgage, customers with a typical A#75,000 25-year capital repayment mortgage could save over A#20,000 and pay their mortgage off nine years earlier by increasing their repayments by only 4% each year. But check first that your bank or building society allow overpayments and calculate interest daily or you won't get the full benefit.    3. Consider an 'all-in-one' account    'All-in-one' accounts where your current account, mortgage and even your savings and loans are combined into one, are very much talk of the town at the moment. Real savings can be made by taking this route, e.g. with a current account mortgage, customers can save over A#41,000* simply by combining their current account, savings and mortgage account into one. It really is that easy.    * Assumes borrowing of A#75,000, Property Valuation of A#100,000, A#2,000 monthly income paid into the account increasing by 3% each year, monthly savings of A#40 and initial savings of A#5,500 paid into the account on day one. Comparison made against a standard variable rate mortgage of 5.95%.    4. Switch to a lower rate credit card    Look at the very low introductory rates on the market but check too how long the rate applies for and whether this low rate applies to balance transfers/new purchases or both.    5. Switch your current account    The process of switching is now much simpler, so don't be afraid to try the move. The competitiveness of the market has also increased considerably over the last 12 months. Be wary though of shopping just on price; the amount of choice in how you can bank (branch, telephone and Internet) should be a consideration, as should reputation on the quality of service you're going to get. Talk to your friends about who they bank with and whether the service they've had is good, bad or indifferent. Particularly if you travel more than twice a year, eat out a lot, buy lots of CDs or videos or are thinking about buying a new car, look into a packaged account that comes, in return for a small monthly fee, with a whole lot of financial discounts and deals on travel and other recreational activities.    6. Take out a stakeholder pension    If you've spare disposable income, stakeholder pensions for either yourself or family members are great vehicles for both saving for the future and tax efficiencies, as you'll get relief at your marginal tax rate. The only people not eligible for a stakeholder pension are those on salaries over A#30,000 with an occupational scheme or those who are controlling directors. Even if you don't qualify you can still ensure others can benefit from the low cost tax-free benefits as you are able to set one up and pay in on behalf of any of your family members, e.g. spouses earning less than A#30k, full time mothers, people taking career breaks; children, grandchildren. Minimum contributions of between A#20 and A#300 per month, including tax relief, can be made (so for each A#100 that means you only contribute A#78 of your own money for a lower rate taxpayer and A#60 for a higher rate taxpayer, the taxman contributes the rest!). All the money invested in the fund grows free of tax and all income, excluding dividends on shares, is tax-free too.    7. Make your savings work harder for you    Consider opening an on-line savings account. The low cost to banks of maintaining these accounts means that they generally offer higher interest than those available in branches. They also offer the added flexibility and convenience of allowing you to operate your account 24-hours a day. In some cases transfers between accounts at the same institution are done instantly, in effect giving you instant access to your cash, otherwise it can take up to three days for funds to be transferred.    8. Use your ISA allowance    If you have A#3,000 in an instant access account you will earn A#19.50 gross interest pa. (A#15.60 net). If you put this into an instant access ISA you will receive A#111 and this will not be taxed - an increase of A#95.40    9. Insurance    Cut this year 's insurance costs. By staying with your current insurance provider for another year, you could be paying too much for your cover. Shop around for a competitive home insurance quotation with additional discounts available if you have an alarm or if you have certain types of current account, usually called 'packaged' accounts. Look at insurers who offer flexible payment methods, including interest free monthly instalments and money to cover the cost of any transfer fee charged by your current insurer. At this time of year it is important to ensure that you are sufficiently covered for both buildings and contents as the unpredictable weather causes more problems with flooding and storm damage each year. And don't get caught out. Some people do not increase the level of their insurance cover for home contents even though they are adding to them all the time. It makes sense then to make an inventory of your contents to make sure you will be adequately covered if the worst happens.    10. Ask your bank for a customer service review    If your bank hasn't offered to sit down and discuss your finances with you at least once in the last two years now's the time to ask for one. Your bank should be working hard to make your money work harder for you. If they don't, find a bank that will.    And finally... don't just take our word for it    Take advice from people whose job it is to provide guidance and advice on financial products. Whether independent or from the increasing number of high street banks that provide this service free for existing customers, it's well worth while investing a little of your time to save you money. And if you are in debt look at the host of free advice offered by your bank, Citizens Advice and specialists like the Money Advice Trust.

Do you want a tracker mortgage that goes up or down with the Bank of England’s base rate, or do you want the security of a fixed rate that won’t change for a set time?

423,133930,"     The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings:    OVERVIEW       -- Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority's issuance is an ABS  transaction backed by private student loans made under Massachusetts  Educational Financing Authority's loan program.       -- We assigned our preliminary ratings to the issue L senior 2019A and  2019B bonds, and subordinate 2019C bonds.       -- The preliminary ratings reflect our view of the transaction's credit  support and subordination, and the results of our scenario analyses, among  other factors.    NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) April 23, 2019--S&P Global Ratings today  assigned its preliminary ratings to Massachusetts Educational Financing  Authority's $305.49 million education loan revenue bonds Issue L series 2019  (see list).    The bonds issuance is an asset-backed securities (ABS) transaction backed by  private student loans made under Massachusetts Educational Financing  Authority's loan program.    The preliminary ratings are based on information as of April 23, 2019.  Subsequent information may result in the assignment of final ratings that  differ from the preliminary ratings.    The preliminary ratings reflect:       -- The availability of approximately 13.3%-13.9% and 7.7%-8.1% of credit  support available (including excess spread) in our 'AA (sf)' and 'BBB (sf)'  break-even cash flow scenarios, respectively. The credit support is defined as  maximum net loss rates that our 'AA' and 'BBB' break-even cash flow scenarios  could absorb while still making interest payments on every payment date and  principal payments by the legal maturity. These credit support levels provide  coverage of approximately 6.0x and 3.5x our base-case net loss assumptions,  respectively.       -- Expected Issue L's total parity of 101.7% upon the issuance of the  2019 bonds, which is expected to grow to the target release level of 106.0%  over the transaction's life. Total parity is defined as a ratio of the total  assets to the sum of the outstanding bond balance with the accrued interest,  unpaid program expenses, and subordinated program expenses. The total assets  include the aggregate loan principal balance with the accrued interest  (excluding defaulted loans) and the money in Issue L's accounts other than the  rebate fund.       -- Expected Issue L's senior parity of 115.4% upon the issuance of the  2019 bonds, which is expected to grow to the target release level of 116.0%  over the transaction's life. Senior parity is defined as a ratio of the total  assets to the sum of the outstanding senior bond balance with the accrued  interest, unpaid program expenses, and subordinated program expenses.       -- Approximately 12% subordination for the Issue L senior bonds provided  by the Issue L subordinate bonds. Upon the 2019 bond issuance, the Issue L  senior bonds will consist of series 2019A, 2019B, 2018A, and 2018B, while the  subordinate bonds will consist of series 2019C and 2018C. In the future, the  authority may issue additional senior bonds without issuing additional  subordinate bonds, which could reduce the overall subordination supporting all  Issue L senior bonds. Subordination is defined as the subordinate bond balance  divided by the total bond balance.       -- The fully funded taxable and tax-exempt reserve accounts with target  balances of 1.0% of the outstanding taxable and tax-exempt bond balances,  respectively. Each reserve account is subject to a floor of approximately 0.6%  of the related initial bond balance: $1,589,750 is the taxable reserve account  floor and $1,473,700 is the tax-exempt reserve account floor. If available  funds held in other accounts (excluding the rebate fund) are insufficient, the  reserve accounts will be available to pay bond principal at maturity, sinking  fund principal installments, interest on every interest payment date, and  program expenses when due.       -- The characteristics of existing Issue L loans (approximately $225.6  million, as of Jan 31, 2019), including seasoned loans transferred from the  issue H resolution in 2018 (approximately $39.0 million as of Jan. 31, 2019).  Approximately 54% of the existing pool includes obligors with FICO scores of  750 and above; approximately 98.9% of the existing pool consists of cosigned  loans; and approximately 98.7% of the existing pool consists of loans made to  students at four-year schools at the time of loan origination.       -- The expected quality of the credit-based loans to be originated during  the loan origination period ending on June 30, 2020, and recycling period  ending on Sept. 30, 2020.       -- The interest payments made on every interest payment date and  principal payments made by the bond maturity dates in the stressed cash flow  modeling scenarios that we believe are consistent with the assigned 'AA (sf)'  and 'BBB (sf)' ratings.       -- A scenario analysis indicating that under moderately stressful  economic conditions (defined as approximately 2.25x expected defaults), the  'AA (sf)' ratings would not decline more than one rating category in the first  year and that the 'BBB (sf)' rating would not decline more than two rating  categories in the first year, which are both consistent with our credit  stability criteria.       -- Our 'AA-' municipal issuer credit rating, with a stable outlook, on  MEFA (general obligation).       -- Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency's (PHEAA) servicing  capabilities.

     The following is a press release from S&P Global Ratings:    OVERVIEW       -- Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority's issuance is an ABS  transaction backed by private student loans made under Massachusetts  Educational Financing Authority's loan program.       -- We assigned our preliminary ratings to the issue L senior 2019A and  2019B bonds, and subordinate 2019C bonds.       -- The preliminary ratings reflect our view of the transaction's credit  support and subordination, and the results of our scenario analyses, among  other factors.    NEW YORK (S&P Global Ratings) April 23, 2019--S&P Global Ratings today  assigned its preliminary ratings to Massachusetts Educational Financing  Authority's $305.49 million education loan revenue bonds Issue L series 2019  (see list).    The bonds issuance is an asset-backed securities (ABS) transaction backed by  private student loans made under Massachusetts Educational Financing  Authority's loan program.    The preliminary ratings are based on information as of April 23, 2019.  Subsequent information may result in the assignment of final ratings that  differ from the preliminary ratings.    The preliminary ratings reflect:       -- The availability of approximately 13.3%-13.9% and 7.7%-8.1% of credit  support available (including excess spread) in our 'AA (sf)' and 'BBB (sf)'  break-even cash flow scenarios, respectively. The credit support is defined as  maximum net loss rates that our 'AA' and 'BBB' break-even cash flow scenarios  could absorb while still making interest payments on every payment date and  principal payments by the legal maturity. These credit support levels provide  coverage of approximately 6.0x and 3.5x our base-case net loss assumptions,  respectively.       -- Expected Issue L's total parity of 101.7% upon the issuance of the  2019 bonds, which is expected to grow to the target release level of 106.0%  over the transaction's life. Total parity is defined as a ratio of the total  assets to the sum of the outstanding bond balance with the accrued interest,  unpaid program expenses, and subordinated program expenses. The total assets  include the aggregate loan principal balance with the accrued interest  (excluding defaulted loans) and the money in Issue L's accounts other than the  rebate fund.       -- Expected Issue L's senior parity of 115.4% upon the issuance of the  2019 bonds, which is expected to grow to the target release level of 116.0%  over the transaction's life. Senior parity is defined as a ratio of the total  assets to the sum of the outstanding senior bond balance with the accrued  interest, unpaid program expenses, and subordinated program expenses.       -- Approximately 12% subordination for the Issue L senior bonds provided  by the Issue L subordinate bonds. Upon the 2019 bond issuance, the Issue L  senior bonds will consist of series 2019A, 2019B, 2018A, and 2018B, while the  subordinate bonds will consist of series 2019C and 2018C. In the future, the  authority may issue additional senior bonds without issuing additional  subordinate bonds, which could reduce the overall subordination supporting all  Issue L senior bonds. Subordination is defined as the subordinate bond balance  divided by the total bond balance.       -- The fully funded taxable and tax-exempt reserve accounts with target  balances of 1.0% of the outstanding taxable and tax-exempt bond balances,  respectively. Each reserve account is subject to a floor of approximately 0.6%  of the related initial bond balance: $1,589,750 is the taxable reserve account  floor and $1,473,700 is the tax-exempt reserve account floor. If available  funds held in other accounts (excluding the rebate fund) are insufficient, the  reserve accounts will be available to pay bond principal at maturity, sinking  fund principal installments, interest on every interest payment date, and  program expenses when due.       -- The characteristics of existing Issue L loans (approximately $225.6  million, as of Jan 31, 2019), including seasoned loans transferred from the  issue H resolution in 2018 (approximately $39.0 million as of Jan. 31, 2019).  Approximately 54% of the existing pool includes obligors with FICO scores of  750 and above; approximately 98.9% of the existing pool consists of cosigned  loans; and approximately 98.7% of the existing pool consists of loans made to  students at four-year schools at the time of loan origination.       -- The expected quality of the credit-based loans to be originated during  the loan origination period ending on June 30, 2020, and recycling period  ending on Sept. 30, 2020.       -- The interest payments made on every interest payment date and  principal payments made by the bond maturity dates in the stressed cash flow  modeling scenarios that we believe are consistent with the assigned 'AA (sf)'  and 'BBB (sf)' ratings.       -- A scenario analysis indicating that under moderately stressful  economic conditions (defined as approximately 2.25x expected defaults), the  'AA (sf)' ratings would not decline more than one rating category in the first  year and that the 'BBB (sf)' rating would not decline more than two rating  categories in the first year, which are both consistent with our credit  stability criteria.       -- Our 'AA-' municipal issuer credit rating, with a stable outlook, on  MEFA (general obligation).       -- Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency's (PHEAA) servicing  capabilities. Through its commercial servicing line of business, PHEAA  serviced $34.7 billion for lenders as of Dec. 31, 2018, with an approximately  $9.3 billion of private student loans, which makes PHEAA one of the nation's  largest servicers of private student loans.       -- Our 'AA-' municipal issuer credit rating, with a negative outlook, on  PHEAA (general obligation).

425,899739,"* He found nobody spoke about the incident when he returned to school next day  * He's partnered with Grief Encounter to launch hotline for grieving children  Martin Lewis has revealed he still struggles to cope with his late mother's death and is 'deeply scarred' by the loss.  The MoneySavingExpert, 46, from Manchester, appeared on Loose Women today to discuss how he tragically lost his mum just before his 12th birthday, after she was involved in a horrific accident while horse riding with his sister.  In an emotional interview, Martin admitted he found it difficult to open up about the ordeal for decades, but after teaming up with the charity Grief Encounter, he hopes people will be able deal with grief better than he did.  'I am still now 35 years later deeply scarred,' he told the panel. 'It was a defining point in my life. It changed the way I act and behave. It was devastating. 'We didn’t know what to do. It was the mid 80s you didn’t do that type of thing. My father, my sister and I were incredibly wounded for such a long time.'  And his honesty touched a lot of hearts, with many viewers insisting his late mother would be 'proud' of him.  'Loose Women was a hard watch today,' penned one social media user. 'Martin Lewis you are truly fantastic. Your mom would be so proud.'  Today, the charity has launched a grief talk helpline to encourage children or parents to open up about their loss and to receive guidance in return - something close to Martin's heart.  Martin, who often gives advice on This Morning, revealed what made the death harder to come to terms with was that nobody at school even acknowledged the ordeal.  Speaking honestly on Loose Women today, he said: 'When I walked back to the classroom nobody said anything to me, and it was like it didn’t happen. It was as if I never had a mother who I had just lost.'  The expert is now a patron for Grief Encounter, but he admits he was reluctant at first.  'A few years ago Grief Encounter charity asked me to become a patron...initially I said no because I didn’t want to expose why I was relevant to be a patron,' he said.  'But I then agreed to be a patron, and then last year on Mother's day was the only time I agreed to talk about [on Radio 5 Live].  He continued: 'It was cathartic. I had a romantic break away with my wife, and I had tens and thousands of messages. It was like coming out of the grief closet. Talking about it is helpful. I am better at it now.  'I couldn’t even tell anyone what I had been through, but I can now admit it. When Grief Encounter had told me they wanted to set up a helpline I said, 'Let's do it. I'll pay for it.'  'It's free, it's confidential and it’s not just phones - it's online, chat and texts. We would like them to do it with parental permission, but you can pick it up and call and there will be someone to offer advice and guidance.'  And social media was flooded with messages in support of Martin Lewis - and many viewers commended him for opening up on such a sensitive topic.  'Felt very sad for Martin Lewis on #LooseWomen today,' wrote one. 'He is doing a great thing with the help line for others going through the loss of a parent as he did. The panel were visibly affected by his emotion and it was so sad.'  Another penned: 'This conversation with Martin Lewis, talking about losing his mum at age eleven is so moving. His devastation is palpable. It is so difficult for him to talk about and almost painful to watch. Brave man.'  A separate viewer empathised: '#Martin Lewis, very brave and heartfelt interview. I can totally understand all that you said as I lost my mum 27 years ago very suddenly when I was a teenager. I didn't really have anyone to talk to and I had to grow up overnight.'  Martin also admitted he found it hard to speak about his mother's death with his family, and it is only in recent years that he has been more open about it.  'I didn't talk to my father or sister about it because none of us could cope with this sudden change to our lives,' he explained. 'The next day she was gone.'  However, Martin - who has six-year-old daughter Sapphire with his wife Lara Lewington - is trying to teach himself to remember his 'wonderful' parent, rather than the pain he felt at a young age.  'I struggle to remember anything other than the pain,' he said. 'I am trying to remember the wonderful person I lost, not remember that I lost a wonderful person.'  'One of the lessons I learnt is that you feel guilty about feeling happy. Actually my philosophy now is you grab every moment of happiness you can possibly have.  He added: 'My mum was 35, she was so much younger than I am now when she went. I think God forbid something happens to me. The last thing I would want is the people who you love to be constantly upset and miserable and sad.'  'What we have to remember when we go through grief is how we want someone to remember us, we want them to miss us, and want them to care, but we wouldn't want them to be miserable and upset. They are things you can't see when the horrible fog of blackness is around you.'  Martin hopes his latest partnership and the new talk helpline will help others who have loved and lost.  'My message here is that I hope someone in my position in 35 years time, although you can't cure grief, won't have scars of the depth I do.'  Martin was touched by the positive response to his appearance on the daytime show.  He tweeted: 'Thank you for all the kind words about my appearance on #loosewomen. I can't respond to them all but they are touching.  'Still a little bit shaken. So taking a little bit of time out. Hopefully my @itvmlshow team won't be too annoyed if I'm a little late for our meet.'","* Martin Lewis, 46, from Manchester, sadly lost his mother aged 11 years old

426,659062,"Declaring that Saddam was a threat the world is better off without, Bush said, ""We are in Iraq today because our goal has always been more than the removal of a brutal dictator; it is to leave a free and democratic Iraq in its place.""  Before a largely friendly audience at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Bush reviewed the reasons behind the 2003 invasion and presented a case for staying the course in Iraq until, he said, ""victory is achieved.""  ""When the history of these days is written, it will tell how America once again defended its own freedom by using liberty to transform nations from bitter foes to strong allies,"" Bush said.  Much is at stake for the president in today's balloting. While his own public approval ratings have recently seen slight improvements, overall support for the war remains at an all-time low.  Installing a fully functional, representative government amid continued violence and instability is a critical test of Iraq's fledging democracy.  In recent weeks, Bush has salted his speeches with acknowledgments of the setbacks and challenges of stabilizing Iraq, while sticking to a largely rosy assessment of progress.  He called today's vote a major turning point for the region.  ""We are living through a watershed moment in the story of freedom,"" Bush said. ""Iraqis will go to the polls to choose a government that will be the only constitutional democracy in the Arab world.""  Bush conceded during last year's presidential election that it appeared Saddam did not have the weapons of mass destruction originally cited by the administration as the primary justification for the war.  He argued Thursday that even putting that issue aside, there were plenty of reasons to wish Saddam out of power: for the good of the Iraqi people, for the future of the region and for national security at home.  ""The United States did not choose war. The choice was Saddam Hussein's,"" Bush said. ""Given Saddam's history and the lessons of September the 11th, my decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision.""  For some Democrats, Bush's revisiting of the reasons behind the invasion reopened the debate on how the war was justified at a time when many are calling for a timetable for a troop pullout. Forty Senate Democrats and an independent sent him a letter demanding he provide a plan and a schedule for withdrawal.  ""The president's speech today failed to provide the American people with any insight into his strategy for completing the mission,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said.  Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., whose criticism of Bush's handling of the war largely galvanized his party's opposition, expressed irritation at the president's continued linking of Sept. 11 and the war in Iraq, and his citing of Iraq's emerging democracy as a justification for the war.  ""We go to war because of our national security interests. We don't go to war to start democracy in another country,"" Murtha said. ""We go to war for one reason, and they keep mischaracterizing why we went to war by telling a history that turns out not to be true.""  Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said he hopes 2006 will prove a year of transition in Iraq, with security and other functions transferred back to that country, ""the sooner, the better.""","WASHINGTON - In an admission ahead of today's elections in Iraq, President Bush on Wednesday took responsibility for deciding to invade the country based on intelligence that later proved to be flawed.

WASHINGTON - In an admission ahead of today's elections in Iraq, President Bush on Wednesday took responsibility for deciding to invade the country based on intelligence that later proved to be flawed. But he said he still believes ousting Saddam Hussein was justified.

""It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong,"" Bush said in the last of four speeches before today's Iraqi parliamentary elections. ""As president, I'm responsible for the decision to go into Iraq, and I'm also responsible for fixing what went wrong by reforming our intelligence capabilities.""
Declaring that Saddam was a threat the world is better off without, Bush said, ""We are in Iraq today because our goal has always been more than the removal of a brutal dictator; it is to leave a free and democratic Iraq in its place.""  Before a largely friendly audience at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, Bush reviewed the reasons behind the 2003 invasion and presented a case for staying the course in Iraq until, he said, ""victory is achieved.""  ""When the history of these days is written, it will tell how America once again defended its own freedom by using liberty to transform nations from bitter foes to strong allies,"" Bush said.  Much is at stake for the president in today's balloting. While his own public approval ratings have recently seen slight improvements, overall support for the war remains at an all-time low.  Installing a fully functional, representative government amid continued violence and instability is a critical test of Iraq's fledging democracy.  In recent weeks, Bush has salted his speeches with acknowledgments of the setbacks and challenges of stabilizing Iraq, while sticking to a largely rosy assessment of progress.  He called today's vote a major turning point for the region.  ""We are living through a watershed moment in the story of freedom,"" Bush said. ""Iraqis will go to the polls to choose a government that will be the only constitutional democracy in the Arab world.""  Bush conceded during last year's presidential election that it appeared Saddam did not have the weapons of mass destruction originally cited by the administration as the primary justification for the war.  He argued Thursday that even putting that issue aside, there were plenty of reasons to wish Saddam out of power: for the good of the Iraqi people, for the future of the region and for national security at home.  ""The United States did not choose war. The choice was Saddam Hussein's,"" Bush said. ""Given Saddam's history and the lessons of September the 11th, my decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision.""  For some Democrats, Bush's revisiting of the reasons behind the invasion reopened the debate on how the war was justified at a time when many are calling for a timetable for a troop pullout. Forty Senate Democrats and an independent sent him a letter demanding he provide a plan and a schedule for withdrawal.  ""The president's speech today failed to provide the American people with any insight into his strategy for completing the mission,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., said.  Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., whose criticism of Bush's handling of the war largely galvanized his party's opposition, expressed irritation at the president's continued linking of Sept. 11 and the war in Iraq, and his citing of Iraq's emerging democracy as a justification for the war.  ""We go to war because of our national security interests. We don't go to war to start democracy in another country,"" Murtha said. ""We go to war for one reason, and they keep mischaracterizing why we went to war by telling a history that turns out not to be true.""  Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said he hopes 2006 will prove a year of transition in Iraq, with security and other functions transferred back to that country, ""the sooner, the better."""

430,530445,"When the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the disclosures last summer, it said ""a portfolio manager's ownership in a fund provides a direct indication of his or her alignment with the interests of shareholders in that fund."" Many financial advisers seek out funds whose managers have big personal stakes, arguing that such holdings give managers an extra incentive to do well for investors.  At the largest fund companies, managers with more than $1 million invested include Stephen Petersen of Fidelity Equity-Income Fund, an average performer in Morningstar Inc.'s ""large value"" category over the past five years, and Edward Bousa and Paul Kaplan, co-managers of Vanguard Wellington Fund, in the top 5% of ""moderate allocation"" funds over the five years. The SEC rule requires funds to disclose manager stakes by ranges, not exact dollars, with $1 million-plus as the highest bracket.  Meanwhile, regulatory filings for Vanguard Group's stock index funds and tax-managed index funds show five of seven managers having no money in the funds in those groups that they oversee. Michael Buek, manager of Vanguard 500 Index Fund, the nation's largest stock fund, had between $10,001 and $50,000 in that fund.  Twelve of 27 managers of Fidelity Investments' industry-specific Select funds had no money in the Select funds they manage, according to a filing.  And at the smaller PBHG fund family, Michael Sutton had no money invested in any of the three PBHG funds he has managed since 2000. While two of Mr. Sutton's funds rank in the bottom 10th of Morningstar's ""large growth"" category over the past five years, there are funds that have performed poorly whose managers have big stakes. James Oelschlager at Oak Associates Ltd. has more than $1 million in each of five technology-heavy stock funds he manages or co-manages, two of which Lipper Inc. lists among the worst-performing stock funds of the past five years.  Some fund companies have long touted that their managers are big investors in the funds they oversee, but others suggest that the information about manager holdings isn't that valuable.  At Vanguard, which last year opposed the disclosure of managers' stakes, spokesman John Demming says tying managers' pay to fund performance, a common practice in the industry, ""is a better way to align the interests of the manager with the shareholders."" He says Vanguard encourages managers to invest in their funds, but doesn't require it. Mr. Buek, the Vanguard 500 Index fund manager, says through the spokesman that all his investable assets are at Vanguard.  Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley says knowing a manager's stake in a fund may tell potential investors whether the fund makes sense for the manager's personal portfolio, but ""it doesn't tell them about whether this fund fits into their own portfolio."" Narrowly focused funds like the Select portfolios, in particular, don't make sense for everyone, she says.  Still, some fund firms and individual managers appear to have felt pressure to have sizable stakes to report. When Morningstar Inc. last month criticized Mr. Sutton, chief investment officer of Liberty Ridge Capital Inc., for not investing in the firm's PBHG funds that he runs, the firm responded with a statement that ""a number of the managers have significantly increased their personal investments"" since the year-end figures in the filing. A spokesman said the firm and Mr. Sutton wouldn't comment further.  At T. Rowe Price Group, where many managers have large stakes in their funds, holdout Stephen Boesel dropped his previous policy of not investing in the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund he runs, spokesman Steve Norwitz says. Mr. Boesel had avoided his own fund, a top performer in its Morningstar peer group, so ""there could never be any concern or question that any investment decision he made was in any way influenced by his personal interest,"" Mr. Norwitz says.  The manager made an investment, recently disclosed as between $500,001 and $1 million, after ""seeing the regulatory writing on the wall,"" the T. Rowe Price spokesman says.  It can be tricky for investors to find the new disclosures of manager ownership -- and, once found, to figure out what the numbers mean.  The ownership data is listed in the Statement of Additional Information, filed with the SEC and available to investors on request. Some fund firms also post the documents, which can run to more than 200 pages, on their Web sites. In the past, funds had to disclose ownership only by those managers who are also fund directors or owners of 5% or more of a fund share class.  A particular SAI may provide information on one fund a manager oversees, but not others. There also have been errors in some initial filings. Paul Wick, lead manager of Seligman Communications and Information Fund, says his reported stake in his fund -- $100,001 to $500,000 -- represents his retirement accounts but omits another $1.5 million in shares held through a brokerage account.  ---  NEW CEO: Amvescap PLC named Martin Flanagan, co-chief executive of rival mutual-fund giant Franklin Resources, as its new president and chief executive, effective Aug. 1.

Enron Corp.'s effort to move into the Pennsylvania electric-utility
market cleared an initial hurdle when state regulators agreed to
consider an electricity-supply plan submitted earlier by the
Houston-based energy company. Enron's plan would essentially allow the
company to insert itself into the existing electricity-supply
relationship that Peco Energy Co. has with customers in the Philadelphia
area. Like other states, Pennsylvania has been moving to restructure its
electric industry to allow more competition. Peco had already submitted
a restructuring plan worked out with other parties in the state. The
Enron plan is a competitor to the Peco proposal. A Peco spokesman said
his company was ""disappointed"" in the decision and will consider
formally asking the commission to reconsider the matter.

433,1313725,"They said wounded Iraqi police officers who had been taken to the hospital were later found beheaded.  Though there was no resistance during Wednesday's operation, the Marines from the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment said they found about a dozen triggering devices for roadside bombs hidden above the tiled ceiling of one office. They knocked down dozens of locked doors and searched medicine chests and storage closets for additional weapons.  Hospitals are considered off-limits in traditional warfare. In western Ramadi, however, insurgents have fired on Marines from the rooftop of a women and children's hospital so often that patients were moved to a wing with fewer windows.  The raid exposed the wartime conditions that have endangered the wounded, sick and elderly in this city of 400,000 people. Doctors said they were struggling to provide basic care.  No ambulances operate in the city because drivers are afraid. Experienced physicians have fled the area, critical supplies are depleted and the number of traumatic war-related injuries has skyrocketed.  Just to reach the hospital, residents must negotiate bomb-saturated roads and gunbattles that often block the way.  ""The number of injuries is increasing. The number who can make it (here) is not,"" said one young Iraqi doctor who refused to give his name for fear of insurgent reprisals.  Religious divisions also have paralyzed the medical staff. Shiite doctors fear coming to Sunni Arab-dominated Ramadi, and Sunni doctors are reluctant to travel east to Baghdad.  During Wednesday's raid, tensions were apparent between some doctors and Marines. The Marines, based in Camp Lejeune, N.C., said one member of their platoon had been shot in the arm near the hospital while handing candy to children at a nearby school. Some angrily accused doctors of harboring and helping insurgents.  Doctors said they knew nothing of insurgent activity or the triggering devices found hidden in the hospital. They insisted they were bound by the Hippocratic oath to serve all patients.  ...  OTHER DEVELOPMENTS  Abduction: Kidnappers of a Sunni woman lawmaker have demanded a timetable for withdrawing coalition troops, release of all detainees and a halt to attacks on Shiite mosques, an Iraqi vice president said.

RAMADI, IRAQ - Hundreds of U.S. Marines stormed through dimly lit hallways of the largest hospital in western Iraq on Wednesday, taking control of a facility allegedly used by insurgents - and encountering a regional health infrastructure in serious decay.

Members of al-Qaida in Iraq had been using the Ramadi General Hospital, a seven-story building with some 250 beds, to treat their wounded and fire on U.S. troops in the area, the Marines said.
They said wounded Iraqi police officers who had been taken to the hospital were later found beheaded.  Though there was no resistance during Wednesday's operation, the Marines from the 3rd Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment said they found about a dozen triggering devices for roadside bombs hidden above the tiled ceiling of one office. They knocked down dozens of locked doors and searched medicine chests and storage closets for additional weapons.  Hospitals are considered off-limits in traditional warfare. In western Ramadi, however, insurgents have fired on Marines from the rooftop of a women and children's hospital so often that patients were moved to a wing with fewer windows.  The raid exposed the wartime conditions that have endangered the wounded, sick and elderly in this city of 400,000 people. Doctors said they were struggling to provide basic care.  No ambulances operate in the city because drivers are afraid. Experienced physicians have fled the area, critical supplies are depleted and the number of traumatic war-related injuries has skyrocketed.  Just to reach the hospital, residents must negotiate bomb-saturated roads and gunbattles that often block the way.  ""The number of injuries is increasing. The number who can make it (here) is not,"" said one young Iraqi doctor who refused to give his name for fear of insurgent reprisals.  Religious divisions also have paralyzed the medical staff. Shiite doctors fear coming to Sunni Arab-dominated Ramadi, and Sunni doctors are reluctant to travel east to Baghdad.  During Wednesday's raid, tensions were apparent between some doctors and Marines. The Marines, based in Camp Lejeune, N.C., said one member of their platoon had been shot in the arm near the hospital while handing candy to children at a nearby school. Some angrily accused doctors of harboring and helping insurgents.  Doctors said they knew nothing of insurgent activity or the triggering devices found hidden in the hospital. They insisted they were bound by the Hippocratic oath to serve all patients.  ...  OTHER DEVELOPMENTS  Abduction: Kidnappers of a Sunni woman lawmaker have demanded a timetable for withdrawing coalition troops, release of all detainees and a halt to attacks on Shiite mosques, an Iraqi vice president said.

436,459616,"Housing markets in Asheville and Buncombe County set a bevy of records in 2015, putting home ownership out of reach for some while also offering huge rewards for people who bought years ago and are ready to sell now.  Local trends reflect those across the country, national experts say, where low inventory also is pushing up prices.  Particularly significant among regional records is the median Asheville home sale price, which leapt to $242,500, a 7.8 percent increase over the previous record of $225,000 attained in 2006 and last year, said Mike Figura, owner and broker of Community Lifestyle Mosaic Realty in Asheville.  The combination of that price increase with the number of homes sold in Asheville and Buncombe County demonstrates a weaker pace of activity is unlikely, Figura said.  A total of 1,389 Asheville homes sold last year, the most ever. In Buncombe County, the most sold since 2006 at 2,510.  ""The last time we saw (prices) that high, in 2007, they were rising after volume (sold) dropped off,"" Figura said. ""That's an indication of a slowdown. Now, we're seeing peaks in homes selling and home prices – and they're continuing to rise.""  That means the current market is more demand-driven and the prices are ""more real"" than they were before the market crashed in 2007, Figura said. ""The fundamentals are different.""  Other statistics reveal the strength of the seller's market, said Don Davies, founder of Asheville-based Realsearch, a company that analyzes real-estate trends.  The average asking price for homes in Buncombe County, including Asheville, as of Jan. 5 was $539,641 – the highest ever.  Also as of that date, 1,187 county homes were on the market – the lowest since 2004, Davies said.  ""At one time, what was setting high (average) prices was that there were lots of homes over $1 million,"" he said. ""Now, the inventory is low and the demand is high. That's driven prices up and makes the average higher.""  With fewer houses priced between $230,000 and $280,000, only more expensive residences remain, Davies said – another cause of a higher average price.  National attention on Asheville as a destination, as a desirable place to retire, as a region with four seasons, and as a beautiful location with a high quality of life all benefit the seller at the expense of the buyer, said Susan Duncan, owner and broker in charge at Exit Realty Vistas in Arden.  ""The (sellers') market is really booming; it's very hot right now,"" Duncan said.  This cuts two ways, Figura said.  ""I'm happy to see real-estate appreciation for those who invested at the right time,"" Figura said. ""This is their nest egg.""  At the same time, Figura said those hoping to reap a substantial return on a real estate investment by starting now ""are going to have a much harder time than those who started 15 years ago.""  Jonathan Stanley, 39, an IT director at a Hendersonville-based nonprofit organization, is among those homeowners set to benefit.  He and his wife own a 1,450-square-foot house on Dale Street in West Asheville that Stanley bought just over 13 years ago for $117,500.  ""I plan to list it at $225,000,"" said Stanley, who's currently renting that house to tenants and living in Mills River, Henderson County, with his wife, Tracy, and their daughter, 5, and 1-year-old son.  They are keeping their options open. The Stanleys might buy in Mills River or they might decide to build a new home, he said.  The target time for ""serious"" house-hunting is summer, Stanley said.  He hopes to clear about $75,000 in profit once commissions and other closing costs are paid to purchase a new home.  The Stanleys are searching for something in the $300,000 price range that's about 2,000 square feet, he said.  ""We're planning to have more children.""  But many in Asheville and Buncombe County looking to buy are challenged due to rapidly rising prices, low inventory and out-of-towners paying cash for what is available.  ""It's sad to see in our society that you can be a hardworking adult and not be able to afford decent housing,"" Figura said.  This is happening nationwide, too, said Jonathan Miller, the New York-based co-founder of Miller Samuel, a residential real estate appraisal company, and the commercial valuation firm Miller Cicero.  ""Low inventory is forcing housing prices to rise far faster than wage growth,"" Miller said.  ""Housing prices are above the prefinancial crisis high that was a product of zero lending standards,"" he said.  In the current cycle, prices are rising for the opposite reason.  ""Tight credit causes inventory to fall because sellers can't buy in the same numbers they did before,"" Miller said. ""This is not healthy or sustainable.""  At the local level, one result is that homeowners are able to sell high, but they're also going to have to buy high, said Duncan, the Exit Realty Vistas owner.

437,264623,"After five days of debate, the first vote came on an amendment to speed up coverage for pregnant women and children as standard health benefits. Senators voted 55-42 for the proposal, by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, Connecticut Democrat.  ""There is momentum,"" Mr. Dodd told reporters with a laugh after the vote. ""I'll admit it's not a thundering momentum, but it is momentum.""  Republicans had been blocking a vote on the amendment, saying they wanted more time for GOP senators to explain the specifics of Majority Leader George J. Mitchell's health bill.  Mr. Mitchell on Monday finally agreed with some Democratic colleagues and called the GOP tactics a filibuster. He threatened to keep the Senate in session starting last night if voting did not start.  For much of the day, Republicans were silent on their strategy. After a late-afternoon meeting with his colleagues, Minority Leader Bob Dole told reporters his party would agree to let voting begin in exchange for being allowed to offer an amendment today.  ""We think it's very important that we have an opportunity to tell the American people about the bill. . . . They can't talk about the bill, so they want to talk about some amendments to the bill,"" Mr. Dole said. ""We're going to continue to make our case. We're not going to be rushed in the process.""  The first GOP amendment may be to allow Americans to keep the health plan and the benefits they now have instead of being subjected to an imposed benefits package, Republican senators said.  Mr. Mitchell's health proposal seeks to cover 95 percent of the public with health insurance by 2000 through a combination of insurance reforms and a restructuring of the way Americans buy their health insurance. Small businesses and low-income individuals would get subsidies. The proposal would use employer mandates as a last resort if other reforms did not work.  The main problem with the Mitchell approach is political - most people do not think it has the votes to pass the Senate.  ""I don't think any version of any plan has anywhere near 50 votes. I think a lot of people have plans that will get you 40 votes, but nothing gets enough to pass,"" said Sen. John B. Breaux, Louisiana Democrat.  One of those plans will have the signature of Mr. Breaux and Sen. John H. Chafee, Rhode Island Republican, who have headed the bipartisan group of senators crafting an alternative. What started months ago as a group of seven senators from the Finance Committee has grown to more than 20 senators.  The lawmakers, who have dubbed themselves the ""mainstream group,"" neared final agreement on a proposal they intend to present today to Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Dole. They were split yesterday on whether the proposal should be in the form of amendments to the Mitchell bill or a separate bill.  Their plan would not include employer mandates and likely would require each state to develop a plan if 95 percent of the people in the state did not have health insurance in the future. A provision sure to cause problems - especially with Republicans - is a tax on high-cost insurance premiums.  As ""mainstream"" senators left one of several meetings they held yesterday in Mr. Chafee's office, some said keeping health costs down was their top priority.  ""If you don't have cost containment, there's not much sense in passing a health bill that will cause health costs to explode,"" said Sen. William S. Cohen, Maine Republican.  Sen. John Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, said that he did not know how the Senate as a whole would receive the group's work and that the next few days could determine its viability.  ""There are some philosophical, practical, political, ideological differences on what people are willing to do for cost containment. . . . None of them individually have a majority, obviously. So you're still washing around trying to find your meeting ground on one of the toughest and most important components of health care reform,"" Mr. Kerry said.  Once finished, the mainstream group's proposal would be in competition with an even more moderate plan being advanced by two Democratic and two Republican senators that is based on the bipartisan bill introduced last week in the House.  ""Our strategy is not to try to change the Mitchell bill just enough to pick up three or four Republicans; our strategy is to present an alternative in the center that is acceptable on both sides of the aisle,"" said Sen. David L. Boren, Oklahoma Democrat, who is part of both moderate groups.  Lawmakers at either end of the ideological spectrum are skeptical of the work going on in Mr. Chafee's office. Liberal lawmakers warned Monday that they might not vote for a more conservative bill.  Yesterday, Republican lawmakers also admitted to some nervousness.  ""It's fair to say there's a tension there because people are beginning to think that a Chafee bill, though it improves Mitchell, would go to conference and be `crime-billed,' "" said Sen. Malcolm Wallop, Wyoming Republican. He was referring to what happened to the crime bill, which became more costly and weaker in some respects in a conference committee.  Republicans also continued their method of holding a daily news conference to point out problems with the Mitchell bill. Yesterday's topic focused on Mr. Mitchell and President Clinton's assertion that Americans would continue to have choices in their health care decisions.  ""This is a centralized, top-down federal approach that says you do it our way or you're out of business,"" said Sen. Larry Craig, Idaho Republican.  Mr. Mitchell, who had avoided making specific rebuttals to such criticism, yesterday took to the Senate floor to denounce the GOP comments.  ""The arguments made today are almost word for word the arguments made against Social Security and almost word for word the arguments made against Medicare. . . . Those arguments didn't prevail then. I hope they don't prevail now,"" Mr. Mitchell said.  ****ILLUSTRATION/BOX  YESTERDAY'S HEALTH CARE REFORM DEVELOPMENTS:  SENATE: Republicans agreed to allow a vote on the first amendment, which would speed up health benefits for children and pregnant women, averting a threatened 24-hour session. The amendment passed 55-42. Also, a bipartisan group of senators neared final agreement on an alternative health plan.  HOUSE: Democratic leaders are awaiting financial estimates from the Congressional Budget Office on the health care reform proposals.  WHITE HOUSE: First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared at a rally where Families USA - a pro-administration health group - unveiled a clock that shows 500,000 people have lost health insurance since the Senate started its debate Aug. 9. The clock did not show how many regained insurance.  OTHER: The pro- and anti-Clinton forces announced they were hitting the airwaves with new ads. The Health Care Reform Project, a coalition of groups backing Clinton-style reforms, said it would be running a radio ad criticizing the bipartisan plan introduced last week in the House.

Faced with the prospect of an all-night session on health care reform, Senate Republicans gave in yesterday to allow a vote on the first Democratic amendment and vowed to offer the first GOP amendment today.

As Republicans let the debate shift into its next phase, a fluctuating group of about 20 Democratic and Republican senators met through much of the day and neared agreement on a bipartisan health reform alternative.
After five days of debate, the first vote came on an amendment to speed up coverage for pregnant women and children as standard health benefits. Senators voted 55-42 for the proposal, by Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, Connecticut Democrat.  ""There is momentum,"" Mr. Dodd told reporters with a laugh after the vote. ""I'll admit it's not a thundering momentum, but it is momentum.""  Republicans had been blocking a vote on the amendment, saying they wanted more time for GOP senators to explain the specifics of Majority Leader George J. Mitchell's health bill.  Mr. Mitchell on Monday finally agreed with some Democratic colleagues and called the GOP tactics a filibuster. He threatened to keep the Senate in session starting last night if voting did not start.  For much of the day, Republicans were silent on their strategy. After a late-afternoon meeting with his colleagues, Minority Leader Bob Dole told reporters his party would agree to let voting begin in exchange for being allowed to offer an amendment today.  ""We think it's very important that we have an opportunity to tell the American people about the bill. . . . They can't talk about the bill, so they want to talk about some amendments to the bill,"" Mr. Dole said. ""We're going to continue to make our case. We're not going to be rushed in the process.""  The first GOP amendment may be to allow Americans to keep the health plan and the benefits they now have instead of being subjected to an imposed benefits package, Republican senators said.  Mr. Mitchell's health proposal seeks to cover 95 percent of the public with health insurance by 2000 through a combination of insurance reforms and a restructuring of the way Americans buy their health insurance. Small businesses and low-income individuals would get subsidies. The proposal would use employer mandates as a last resort if other reforms did not work.  The main problem with the Mitchell approach is political - most people do not think it has the votes to pass the Senate.  ""I don't think any version of any plan has anywhere near 50 votes. I think a lot of people have plans that will get you 40 votes, but nothing gets enough to pass,"" said Sen. John B. Breaux, Louisiana Democrat.  One of those plans will have the signature of Mr. Breaux and Sen. John H. Chafee, Rhode Island Republican, who have headed the bipartisan group of senators crafting an alternative. What started months ago as a group of seven senators from the Finance Committee has grown to more than 20 senators.  The lawmakers, who have dubbed themselves the ""mainstream group,"" neared final agreement on a proposal they intend to present today to Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Dole. They were split yesterday on whether the proposal should be in the form of amendments to the Mitchell bill or a separate bill.  Their plan would not include employer mandates and likely would require each state to develop a plan if 95 percent of the people in the state did not have health insurance in the future. A provision sure to cause problems - especially with Republicans - is a tax on high-cost insurance premiums.  As ""mainstream"" senators left one of several meetings they held yesterday in Mr. Chafee's office, some said keeping health costs down was their top priority.  ""If you don't have cost containment, there's not much sense in passing a health bill that will cause health costs to explode,"" said Sen. William S. Cohen, Maine Republican.  Sen. John Kerry, Massachusetts Democrat, said that he did not know how the Senate as a whole would receive the group's work and that the next few days could determine its viability.  ""There are some philosophical, practical, political, ideological differences on what people are willing to do for cost containment. . . . None of them individually have a majority, obviously. So you're still washing around trying to find your meeting ground on one of the toughest and most important components of health care reform,"" Mr. Kerry said.  Once finished, the mainstream group's proposal would be in competition with an even more moderate plan being advanced by two Democratic and two Republican senators that is based on the bipartisan bill introduced last week in the House.  ""Our strategy is not to try to change the Mitchell bill just enough to pick up three or four Republicans; our strategy is to present an alternative in the center that is acceptable on both sides of the aisle,"" said Sen. David L. Boren, Oklahoma Democrat, who is part of both moderate groups.  Lawmakers at either end of the ideological spectrum are skeptical of the work going on in Mr. Chafee's office. Liberal lawmakers warned Monday that they might not vote for a more conservative bill.  Yesterday, Republican lawmakers also admitted to some nervousness.  ""It's fair to say there's a tension there because people are beginning to think that a Chafee bill, though it improves Mitchell, would go to conference and be `crime-billed,' "" said Sen. Malcolm Wallop, Wyoming Republican. He was referring to what happened to the crime bill, which became more costly and weaker in some respects in a conference committee.  Republicans also continued their method of holding a daily news conference to point out problems with the Mitchell bill. Yesterday's topic focused on Mr. Mitchell and President Clinton's assertion that Americans would continue to have choices in their health care decisions.  ""This is a centralized, top-down federal approach that says you do it our way or you're out of business,"" said Sen. Larry Craig, Idaho Republican.  Mr. Mitchell, who had avoided making specific rebuttals to such criticism, yesterday took to the Senate floor to denounce the GOP comments.  ""The arguments made today are almost word for word the arguments made against Social Security and almost word for word the arguments made against Medicare. . . . Those arguments didn't prevail then. I hope they don't prevail now,"" Mr. Mitchell said.  ****ILLUSTRATION/BOX  YESTERDAY'S HEALTH CARE REFORM DEVELOPMENTS:  SENATE: Republicans agreed to allow a vote on the first amendment, which would speed up health benefits for children and pregnant women, averting a threatened 24-hour session. The amendment passed 55-42. Also, a bipartisan group of senators neared final agreement on an alternative health plan.  HOUSE: Democratic leaders are awaiting financial estimates from the Congressional Budget Office on the health care reform proposals.  WHITE HOUSE: First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared at a rally where Families USA - a pro-administration health group - unveiled a clock that shows 500,000 people have lost health insurance since the Senate started its debate Aug. 9. The clock did not show how many regained insurance.  OTHER: The pro- and anti-Clinton forces announced they were hitting the airwaves with new ads. The Health Care Reform Project, a coalition of groups backing Clinton-style reforms, said it would be running a radio ad criticizing the bipartisan plan introduced last week in the House.  The Health Insurance Association of America unveiled three new ""Harry and Louise"" TV spots.

The jury deliberated nearly three days before handing up its verdicts. It found Erker, 51, guilty of all of the counts in the indictment. The charges included conspiracy, money laundering, false statements and mail and wire frauds. The scheme took place from about 2013 to July 2018.  ""It feels like the world is a good place after all,"" said Bridget De Chagas after the verdict. Her mother, Margaret Whelan, died Feb. 8. She had lost about $220,000 in the scheme.  Thomas Cooper, who was the first victim to testify in the case, called the jury's decision ""the only outcome that was reasonable.""  ""There is such deep betrayal in this case,"" Cooper said. ""There has been a lot of suffering.""  Defense attorney Edwin Vargas told the jury Monday that prosecutors had failed to prove that Erker had defrauded the victims. He said that while Erker had failed his clients, he never intended to hurt them.  During the four-day trial, prosecutors Kathryn Andrachik and Brian McDonough portrayed Erker as a swindler, a man who used his connections to friends and their families to gain money for investments.  Cooper, for instance, testified that he did business with Erker because he wanted a safe, low-risk investment from a local company, not from a major firm. He lost about $300,000 in the scheme.  Other investors took the stand and echoed Cooper, saying they had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in retirement savings through Erker's Westlake financial firm. They said they wanted the money to go low-risk investments.  Instead, prosecutors said, Erker put their money into funds that he owned and controlled, failing to tell his clients that the funds were neither registered nor secured. He poured the money into risky start-up businesses. Some of the funds went to an addition to Erker's home in Avon Lake.  Erker set up call centers in Delaware and Nevada, where workers were given spreadsheets of client information and a script to discuss investors queries, the prosecutors said.  The scheme ended in 2018, when investors failed to receive monthly distribution checks. They went to Erker's office on Detroit Road in Westlake, but no one was there.  Prosecutors said Erker ran a Ponzi scheme with his investors' funds. He would use money from new investors to pay off distributions for original investors.  Investors and their family members testified last week that they trusted Erker and his associates Tara Brunst and Kevin Krantz, both of whom have pleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors. They are expected to be sentenced in the coming months.  For De Chagas, the trial came shortly after the death of her mother, a nurse of 40 years at what is now University Hospitals St. John Medical Center. Margaret Whelan was 73. Another family member lost nearly $250,000 from Erker, De Chagas said.  ""My mother just wanted to put her money where it would be the safest,"" she said.

440,1444759,"It argued that compelling people to save into pensions may be the ""next logical step"" if the weakness of the economy and sluggish wage growth put people off trying to save for their later years.  The report said that future governments may have to consider stepping into people's finances more to help them manage their money, by forcing them to save into a pension, for example, and helping with loans through various ""pinch points"" in their lives such as dealing with childcare costs. The Government's landmark scheme to eventually automatically enrol 10 million people into workplace pensions started last month and the initiative is being phased in over a six-year period.  Workers are allowed to opt out of schemes after they have been enrolled, but the Government wants employers to re-enrol people who have opted out every three years, to try to persuade them to save.

442,224005,"On her TikTok account, Interiors_Shopping, the mum-of-three shares the best budget finds in a variety of high street shops, here she gives her favourite tips for finding budget-friendly pieces that look expensive.  Where to shop  According to the interior designer, there are a few shops totally killing it when it comes to budget interiors.  Leah said: “Primark, Dunelm, and B&M are smashing it when it comes to budget, on-trend interior pieces.”  Leah admits the shops are great for expensive-looking buys that she uses in her own house as well as in clients, but notes it’s important to hunt out a good store near you.  “Products available depend on store locations, so hunt around and see which ones offer the best selection of their interiors.  “I think supermarkets can usually be hit and miss, but Sainsbury’s almost always has something good in.”  Little details  Making your home look expensive on a budget means you should always pay attention to the little details, said Leah.  “Pay attention to the finish, if it looks plastic it will look cheap.  “Scalloped edges always work well to create a luxe feeling as does interesting texture on ceramics like vases and dining ware.”  She also recommends keeping an eye out for cushions or blankets which have tassels on the end, the extra finishing touch often makes them look high-end even if they’re not.  Mixing prints and texture  Mixing different prints is another way to make your home look more expensive while adding your own individual style to your home.  If you’re unsure of what prints work well together Leah suggests sticking with black and white tones, “the monochrome look is big right now and always gives a classic look.”  The same goes with adding different textures to your home.  You can do this by having an array of cushions in different textures and patterns to create a unique design for you.  She added: “Buy a cushion cover and fill it with a duck feather insert from Dunelm for £7, chop it in the middle (Mrs Hinch style) and you have a stunning put-together bed.  “You don’t need to spend lots of money buying cushions from designer brands.”  And this way, you can swap out your cushion covers as often as you like to spruce up your space.  Greenery  Another easy and cheap way to make your home look more expensive is by featuring greenery in your home.  And Leah said they don’t have to be real.  Leah Suggests: “There are lots of great artificial plants out there now.  “Make sure they look more expensive than they are by checking they have details on the leaves.”  “Greenery will always make your home look more welcoming and can make a space look completely different.  “IKEA has a great selection of houseplants to choose from for really affordable prices.”  Repurposing  There are no rules on where you can use certain products in your home, so use them wherever looks best explains the interior designer.  Leah said: “You can repurpose candle jars for storage, or use pretty kitchen bowls and fill them with flowers to style a coffee table.  “If you have lamps dotted around your home, switch the lampshades around to create the feel of new furniture without hitting the shops.”  The interior designer said: “Not only will you save money repurposing items you already have, but it’s also more sustainable too.”","LOOKING to spruce up your home, but don’t have the budget to spend hundreds?

If you’re unsure of what prints work well together Leah suggests sticking with black and white tones, “the monochrome look is big right now and always gives a classic look.”  The same goes with adding different textures to your home.  You can do this by having an array of cushions in different textures and patterns to create a unique design for you.  She added: “Buy a cushion cover and fill it with a duck feather insert from Dunelm for £7, chop it in the middle (Mrs Hinch style) and you have a stunning put-together bed.  “You don’t need to spend lots of money buying cushions from designer brands.”  And this way, you can swap out your cushion covers as often as you like to spruce up your space.  Greenery  Another easy and cheap way to make your home look more expensive is by featuring greenery in your home.  And Leah said they don’t have to be real.  Leah Suggests: “There are lots of great artificial plants out there now.  “Make sure they look more expensive than they are by checking they have details on the leaves.”  “Greenery will always make your home look more welcoming and can make a space look completely different.  “IKEA has a great selection of houseplants to choose from for really affordable prices.”  Repurposing  There are no rules on where you can use certain products in your home, so use them wherever looks best explains the interior designer.  Leah said: “You can repurpose candle jars for storage, or use pretty kitchen bowls and fill them with flowers to style a coffee table.  “If you have lamps dotted around your home, switch the lampshades around to create the feel of new furniture without hitting the shops.”  The interior designer said: “Not only will you save money repurposing items you already have, but it’s also more sustainable too.”"
443,274803,"Financial advice can encompass a lot of different services, which fall primarily into two camps:  * Investment management, which includes picking the right mix of stocks, bonds and cash.  * Financial planning, which can include everything from budgeting advice to estate planning.  Comprehensive financial planners have traditionally supplied both investment management and planning services, often charging a percentage of the clients' assets that they manage. A recent survey of nearly 1,000 financial planners by Inside Information, a trade publication, found that the bigger the portfolio, the lower the percentage clients paid. The median annual charge was 1% for portfolios of $1 million or less, sliding to 0.5% for portfolios of $5 million to $10 million. The survey focused on independent advisors who typically charge fees, rather than brokers or insurance agents who are often paid by commissions.  Robo-advisors are cheaper but have limits  The investment management part of the equation is what's getting squeezed by robo-advisors, which are automated services that invest according to computer algorithms.  These digital advisors, which include startups Betterment and Wealthfront as well as offerings from Vanguard, Fidelity and Schwab, usually charge about 0.25% of the portfolio's value. Some services combine automated investing with access to financial planners. Vanguard Personal Advisor Services, for example, charges 0.3% for investment management plus phone access to a human advisor, while Betterment's similar premium service charges 0.4%.  Being able to ask questions isn't the same thing as getting full-on financial planning, however.  A comprehensive planner typically interviews clients to discover their financial goals, how much they owe and own (their balance statement), how much they earn and spend (their cash flow) and what needs to be tweaked to increase the odds of success.

If all you're getting is investment management, though, you're probably paying too much.  Does your advisor earn his or her keep?  Bob Veres, the Inside Information publisher who conducted the survey and who has tracked the financial planning industry for decades, says any advisor who 'merely' provides a well-allocated portfolio and periodic statements is overcharging at anything more than 0.5%. On the other hand, anyone who provides full-service financial planning for less than 1% of assets under management is underpaid, he says.  Most advisors handling portfolios worth less than $1 million charge between 1% and 2% of assets under management, Veres found. That may be a reasonable amount, if clients are getting plenty of financial planning services. But some charge more than 2%, and a handful charge in excess of 4%.

Amateur workmanship not done properly could cost a homeowner as much as £5,000 for every room where they have unsuccessfully tried DIY says the association which also warns against owners carrying out so-called home improvement work, such as an extension, without first gaining the appropriate planning permisison from the local authority,    New loans for country homes    With mortgage lenders now re-launching a range of new loans following the recent surprise quarter-point rise in interest rates, the finance arm of Savills Estate Agents is now offering a an offset mortgage for City workers with huge bonuses who are looking to borrow a large amount of cash to buy a big country home.

Costly DIY  
Essex homeowners who carry out their own do-it-yourself jobs in the home and end up botching are only costing themselves money when it comes to selling their property says the National Association of Estate Agents. Amateur workmanship not done properly could cost a homeowner as much as £5,000 for every room where they have unsuccessfully tried DIY says the association which also warns against owners carrying out so-called home improvement work, such as an extension, without first gaining the appropriate planning permisison from the local authority,    New loans for country homes    With mortgage lenders now re-launching a range of new loans following the recent surprise quarter-point rise in interest rates, the finance arm of Savills Estate Agents is now offering a an offset mortgage for City workers with huge bonuses who are looking to borrow a large amount of cash to buy a big country home.

Based on these false representations, Holovacko obtained 18 cashier's checks totaling approximately $255,000.

But, as experience shows, the industry is unwilling or unable to deliver.'  The review by the FCA into savings in July — which covered 20 of the largest banks and building societies and National Savings — found 'terms and conditions generally difficult to navigate'.  Easy-access accounts, where savers stash half the £700 billion they hold in all types of accounts, often come with teaser rates or limited access to your money.  So if you go for a top rate, watch out for these tricks.  The first happens when banks and building societies launch a new account with a top rate including a bonus that lasts a year. They then close it to new savers and launch a new version.  Then they rely on customers' inertia or lack of knowledge about their account to leave them on low rates of as little as 0.16 pc after tax (0.2 pc before).  Savers can be duped into thinking they earn a better rate as banks tout the account at the higher rate of 1 pc (1.25 pc) or more paid to new rather than loyal savers. It's a ploy that works.  The FCA reports 'a significant proportion of consumers have not switched their savings accounts for long periods of time'.  Some £100 billion is in accounts opened more than five years ago where loyal savers earned as little as 0.24 pc (0.3 pc).  New deals that come with a bonus are not as common as in the past. But some providers are clinging on to them.  One main culprit is Lloyds Bank and its offshoots Halifax, BM Savings and AA Savings. The latter launched a new account last week that put it straight at the top of the best-buy tables at 1.12 pc (1.4 pc). But that drops to 0.4 pc (0.5 pc) after a year. It has several closed issues of this account which pay this low rate.  Lloyds Bank e-Savings account drops to 0.16 pc (0.2 pc) after a year. Some old BM accounts pay just 0.4 pc (0.5 pc), yet it pays 1.08 pc (1.35 pc) to new savers on its current Online Extra 13 account. Halifax pays loyal savers as little as 0.2 pc (0.25 pc).  Others demand you leave a good whack of your savings untouched for over a year to get any bonus at all. For example, Nottingham BS pays a top rate of 1.16 pc (1.45 pc) on its eSaver Plus Issue 6. But you have to leave £5,000 in the account for over a year to qualify for the 0.60 (0.86) percentage point bonus.  This will be paid on November 30 next year — and if you close your account before then, you earn 0.47 pc (0.59 pc).  A newer ploy is to restrict the number of times you can take money out of your account in a year to earn a top rate.  Coventry BS Postsave Easy Access 2 at 1.12 pc (1.4 pc) restricts you to 12 withdrawals a year. And if you have opened one of the earlier versions of this account, you cannot open this one. Britannia Select Access Saver 6 and West Bromwich BS Websaver Limited Access also pay 1.12 pc (1.4 pc), but the restrictions are even more prohibitive.  With Britannia, you get four withdrawals a year, and with West Bromwich it's just three.  Top deals on straightforward accounts with no bonus or withdrawal restrictions come from Sainsbury's Bank eSaver Special at 1.08 pc (1.35 pc) or, on the High Street, Virgin Money at 1.04 pc (1.3 pc).  sy.morris@dailymail.co.uk  © Daily Mail","Savers face a complicated list of dos and don'ts when they open what should be a simple, easy-access account.

That’s why we are out on picket lines yet again.  “By continuing to ignore the longstanding and serious concerns of staff, principals are not only pushing their own workforce to breaking point, but also doing serious harm to the future of higher education and preventing it from being the best it can be.”  In the pay and working conditions dispute, the union is also demanding an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice, a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other insecure contracts, and meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads.  Those walking out on Monday are members at the universities of Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Stirling, Strathclyde and Edinburgh Napier University, Glasgow School of Art, Heriot-Watt University, the Open University and Queen Margaret University.

464,264126,"It's a two-step process. First, the 401(k) would be rolled over into a traditional IRA. Then that IRA would be converted to a Roth.    Any brokerage or mutual fund company can provide the forms for rolling the 401(k) into an IRA and then converting the IRA to a Roth. So long as the money is moved directly from the 401(k) to the IRA — without stopping in an ordinary bank account along the way, for instance — there won't be any tax charged, as 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are treated the same for tax purposes.    For the Roth, all the money you convert will be subject to income tax. That's the tax normally paid on withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs. It is charged on conversions because once your money is in a Roth, both the original sum and future investment gains will be tax-free.    There are a number of things to consider:    Shifting from a 401(k) to a traditional IRA can make sense even if you don't take the next step to the Roth, as IRAs offer more investment choices.    Roth investors are never required to make withdrawals, while investors with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs have to begin minimum annual withdrawals after turning 70½. This is important if you want the money to compound longer, or if you'd like to leave the account to heirs, who would get a Roth free of any income tax. (A Roth can be subject to estate tax if your estate is larger than $2 million.)    If you switched to a Roth, you'd have to leave your money to grow in the account for some time to make the move pay. The benefit comes from the tax-free growth that starts once the money is in the Roth.    Generally, a Roth conversion makes sense if you expect your income tax rate to be higher in the future, since paying tax on today's conversion saves you the higher tax you'd have made later on the 401(k) or traditional IRA.    To be sure of benefiting from a Roth conversion, all of the money originally in the 401(k) should go into the Roth. In other words, don't take money from the 401(k) to pay the tax due on conversion. The tax should be paid from other funds.    Since you are in your mid-70s, the clearest benefit of moving from a 401(k) to a Roth is the ability to pass future investment gains to heirs tax-free.    But even that benefit is not certain if you are in a high tax bracket and your heirs are in a low one. The net sum left to your heirs might be higher if they paid a small tax on a 401(k) rather than having you pay a large tax on a conversion.    Try playing with a Roth-conversion calculator, such as the one at  www.calctools  .com/RothConversion.htm.    Q.    My 21-year-old son has repeatedly been denied a credit card because he does not have a credit history. What should he do?    A.    The simplest solution is for your son to get a secured credit card. Unlike the common unsecured card, the secured card requires the holder to deposit money with the issuer before using the card — typically $300 to $500, but sometimes less. The cardholder then has a credit limit equal to the amount on deposit.    After making on-time card payments for a year, he should be able to get a regular credit card.

465,1365225,"Customers fighting high bills should continue to have access to water as long as they pay an amount equal to their average usage or what they were charged in the previous year during the same time period.  In the last two months, Bry said her office has been flooded with calls from frustrated ratepayers.  ""We are hearing from San Diego residents who have complained about inexplicably high water bills and are now at risk of losing service if they do not pay their bills within the normal billing timeline,"" Bry wrote in a press statement Tuesday. ""We must ensure that San Diegans retain access to water during this investigation.""  The grace period should last until a recently announced internal audit of the Public Utilities Department is completed this June.  City Auditor Eduardo Luna said that he will prioritize the issue and will update the public as the investigation unfolds.  The water department has already implemented similar guidelines, said spokesman Jerry McCormick. ""We don't automatically shut off people's water. We always try to work with them.""  San Diegans all over the city have expressed concern about unusually high water bills - surging from hundreds to sometimes thousands of dollars.  Officials with the water department have said that often the increase in water use is due to leaky pipes and toilet or overwatering.  However, before paying for a plumber, residents should check the reading on their meters against any unusually high bill. In a number of cases, outrageous charges have been traced by to meter reads.

SAN DIEGO

Council President Pro Tem Barbara Bry has called for temporary relief for San Diegans who continue to say the city has charged them for water they didn't use.
Customers fighting high bills should continue to have access to water as long as they pay an amount equal to their average usage or what they were charged in the previous year during the same time period.  In the last two months, Bry said her office has been flooded with calls from frustrated ratepayers.  ""We are hearing from San Diego residents who have complained about inexplicably high water bills and are now at risk of losing service if they do not pay their bills within the normal billing timeline,"" Bry wrote in a press statement Tuesday. ""We must ensure that San Diegans retain access to water during this investigation.""  The grace period should last until a recently announced internal audit of the Public Utilities Department is completed this June.  City Auditor Eduardo Luna said that he will prioritize the issue and will update the public as the investigation unfolds.  The water department has already implemented similar guidelines, said spokesman Jerry McCormick. ""We don't automatically shut off people's water. We always try to work with them.""  San Diegans all over the city have expressed concern about unusually high water bills - surging from hundreds to sometimes thousands of dollars.  Officials with the water department have said that often the increase in water use is due to leaky pipes and toilet or overwatering.  However, before paying for a plumber, residents should check the reading on their meters against any unusually high bill. In a number of cases, outrageous charges have been traced by to meter reads.

Odds are such services will more than pay for themselves by finding deductions reluctant do-it-yourself filers may not be aware of.    However, if you want to get a real feel for how the tax system works and start planning for the next year's cycle, consider doing your own taxes. The task can be relatively painless if you use a retail tax software package. They work hand-in-glove with NetFile, Internet-based electronic filing that can generate a refund cheque in just two weeks. This late in the game, paper-based returns will take several weeks longer to process.    When I broke open review copies of the major programs this week in order to file my own return -- and those of two family members -- I hoped to find a package that could tempt me away from the dominant player in the Canadian market: QuickTax, from Intuit Canada (a unit of an American company).    QuickTax has earned its status as numero uno over many years. Using the software may indeed be ""quick"" if you have every information slip and receipt ready to roll. But no matter which program you use, the time-consuming part of the job is marshalling all the documents that allow you to enter the data. (That and consulting tax officials or books to get the proper interpretation on the ridiculously complex Income Tax Act.)    Tax software shields you from having to stay abreast of every nuance and change in the rules, which is one reason Winnipeg-based tax guru Evelyn Jacks stopped publishing her eponymous line-by-line annual guide, although she still publishes a shorter ""tips"" book.    For 99% of tax situations out there -- most are comprised simply of an employee's T-4 slip, the annual RRSP contribution and a few charitable donations -- QuickTax or any of its rivals can easily handle the job.    But if your situation is more complex -- you have non-registered investments, tax shelters, a business on the side, child care, extensive medical expenses, etc. -- I advise supplementing your ""do-it-yourself"" efforts by referring to Ernst & Young's Line-by-Line Guide to Preparing the 2004 Personal Tax Return. When you call up Canada Revenue Agency, odds are this is the book they are referring to themselves.    If you're a QuickTax fan from prior years, there's no major change for users of Windows personal computers. The program still has the intuitive user interface which lets you focus on the T-1 General form and click through on particular lines to reach particular schedules and worksheets.    However, if you're a Macintosh user, things are radically different this year. The package I entrusted to the task in prior years was the Macintosh version of QuickTax. Alas, that option is not available for the 2004 tax year.    The only retail CD-ROM software for the Mac this year is TaxTron, certified by accountants at SofTron, a well-known tax preparation service. The package is supposed to run on both Windows and Macs.    The Mac component is an updated version of GriffTax, a long-established Quebec-based Mac developer acquired by SoftTron last year. Sadly, my experience with TaxTron was not a positive one on either platform, confirming what a colleague at this paper also experienced this week.    He encountered numerous glitches with TaxTron on his Mac, requiring three continuous hours of telephone hand-holding with the firm's support line. And that was for one of the aforementioned simple returns -- one he had already completed with pen and paper in 20 minutes. He persevered only because he wished to generate a quick refund by NetFiling it.    I couldn't confirm this for myself because I never was able to load TaxTron on my Mac. It won't work with the state-of-the art OS/X operating system, and although it's supposed to run on the older 9.2 system, when I reinstalled the older operating system, TaxTron still wouldn't load. With three returns to file and two days allotted to the task, I had no intention of recapitulating my colleague's painful experience.    Undaunted, I tried the Windows version of TaxTron, only to find it, too, failed to load -- this on a Dell laptop. Admittedly, the machine is a few years old, so I also tried the package on a newer desktop PC. It did install, though not automatically, as the vendor claims.    A first attempt to update the software over the Internet failed, but a second succeeded and I put it through its paces. While it performed adequately, I can't in good conscience recommend this package on either platform.    My search for an alternative to QuickTax Windows continued with UFile. This was a happier experience. It loaded easily on the same laptop that wouldn't load TaxTron. I trusted UFile enough to file my mother's terminal tax return. I'd already processed her return with QuickTax and found no significant differences when I used UFile. The program is clean, intuitive and -- as with TaxTron -- ""100% Canadian.""    The only snag I encountered was not UFile's fault: You're not allowed to use NetFile for a deceased person, so I had to go back to the tax stone age and print the return, attach receipts and send it by snail mail.    Now back to you frustrated Macintosh users. If you're not up to spending quality time with TaxTron's support staff, you may have concluded it's time to give up on Macs and buy a Windows computer. That way, you can jump on the Intuit bandwagon, either with QuickTax or TaxWiz, which I didn't try this year.    That's a tempting option, particularly if you also plan to use Intuit's Quicken personal and home business financial software. Quicken is nicely integrated with QuickTax; if you're disciplined enough to keep up with your finances year-round, one of the best deals out there is to buy Quicken XG 2005. I bought a retail copy for $100 at Best Buy, which included a free copy of QuickTax Platinum. That's the Cadillac version of QuickTax, with retirement planning, investor and small business modules included.

""The big picture here is that Canadian home sales and prices remain remarkably resilient, and this is not just a Toronto and Vancouver story any longer,"" said Porter, noting that a number of smaller markets are showing ""some real spark.""

Canada's housing market is no longer a tale of two cities, says BMO chief economist Douglas Porter.

Fresh data showed today that Canadian home sales rose 2.3% in April, the third monthly gain in a row, and a 10% jump from the year before. What is really remarkable, Porter says, is the buoyant figures show there is a lot more to the housing market's resilience than just those two real estate power houses Toronto and Vancouver.
Only four of Canada's top 26 cities reported really weak sales last month - no surprise - all in oil producing provinces, Porter said in a note Friday. Calgary, Edmonton, and Regina were the only cities to post double-digit yearly declines in sales, and Saskatoon declined 9.7%.  But even these laggards are showing signs of stabilizing, with sales flat from the month before, Porter said.

""The big picture here is that Canadian home sales and prices remain remarkably resilient, and this is not just a Toronto and Vancouver story any longer,"" said Porter, noting that a number of smaller markets are showing ""some real spark.""  ""Perhaps the most notable item here is that Canadian sales and prices were both up almost 10% from year-ago levels in April, even at a time when the previously hottest market in the country (Calgary) was struggling. Impressive.""  BMO Capital Markets Economic Research  For a closer look at individual markets here's Porter's rundown:  ""What's hot? Toronto and Vancouver-still.""  Vancouver's market got hotter with a 37.7% year over year jump in sales. Porter said prices are now not only the highest in Canada, but also rising at the fastest pace. Toronto sales are up 16.5% year over year. Porter said both remain sellers' markets, but while detached homes are in extremely short supply, condos are much more plentiful.

471,1421319,"A popular “solution” to the financial problems is for the Postal Service to stop pre-funding health-care retirement benefits for current employees while continuing to fund retirees’ health benefits. As a finance professor who studies the Postal Service, Ibelieve that’s a bad idea. Instead, the Postal Service needs to restructure its retirement plans to be more in line with what is most common in the private sector.  Many public (government) entities today use “defined contribution plans,” as do most private companies in the U.S. In this system, individuals (and many employers) contribute money to a fund — 401(k) or 403(b), for example — on a monthly basis as they get their paycheck. This money is invested, usually in the stock market, and grows. At retirement, people can access the total value of their investment and have access to Medicare health benefits.  The Postal Service currently uses a “defined benefit plan.” In this type of plan, an employer guarantees fixed retirement benefits to employees. In many such plans, the employer and employee also make contributions to fund healthcare benefits for retirement. These health-care benefits are often better than Medicare benefits, and therefore are expensive.  United Parcel Service (UPS), the U.S. Postal Service’s top competitor, recently stopped offering a defined benefit plan because it was “impacting the company’s ability to plan for future costs.”  Defined benefit plans are inherently risky. As an example, they partly caused the recent bankruptcy in Detroit. We don’t know what will happen to the Postal Service in the future. In great part due to the internet, the Postal Service now delivers 40% less first-class mail than it did at the turn of the century. This trend is not likely to improve.  Another proposed solution to making the Postal Service more sustainable, and better able to compete with a private company like UPS, is for the Postal Service to switch from pre-funding the health-care benefits of current employees to a “pay-as-you-go” system where current workers pay for the health-care benefits of current retirees. (The most well-known pay-as-you-go system is Social Security, where individuals’ “contributions,” in the form of Social Security taxes, go toward the retirement income of those now retired.) In the eyes of supporters of this plan, the Postal Service would save billions of dollars.  Switching to a pay-as-you-go plan means the Postal Service would have more money now, which sounds very attractive. But it also means that the health-care retirement benefits of future retirees (people working today) will be in danger. Down the line, when current postal workers retire, there may not be enough money to fund their health-care retirement benefits. At that point, it’s likely the Postal Service will simply say that it doesn’t have money to pay for the healthcare retirement benefits. If that does happen, those responsible for the decision will be long gone and will have collected their salaries.  I propose being honest with employees. The Postal Service needs to switch from a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan to be in alignment with other public and private entities. Next, for new employees, it needs to stop offering separate health-care benefits for retirement. This removes the obligation to fund medical benefits for retirees. Doing so will save a lot of money and make the Postal Service more sustainable and competitive for the future. And, at this time of year, we can focus more on enjoying all those catalogs, greeting cards, and packages and less on worrying if, or how, they will get there.

472,399075,"Three British-based Islamic banks currently offer sharia-compliant financial products, including current accounts and mortgages.  Gatehouse Bank, which rebranded from Milestone Savings last week, pays 2% to customers willing to tie up their money for 12 months. The last time any bank paid as much as this for a one-year bond was in March last year, according to the comparison website Moneyfacts.  Another Islamic institution, Bank of London and the Middle East (BLME), pays 1.95% on one-year deals, while Al Rayan offers 1.85%.  These offers compare with our best-buy rate for a one-year bond of 1.95% — from Atom — and the average 0.74% paid by the big high street brands such as Barclays, Halifax, HSBC and Nationwide.  BLME and Gatehouse are also offering decent rates on two-year accounts (at 2.1% and 2.05% respectively), as well as five-year products (2.55% and 2.45%).  The emergence of sharia savings accounts is a relatively new trend; a decade ago, there were no Islamic brands offering deals to UK customers.  The banks may not be familiar names to most savers, but crucially they are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). This safety net protects up to £85,000 of savings per person if a bank goes bust.  To be sharia-compliant, the banks must invest ethically — so they do not put money into gambling, alcohol, tobacco or arms companies.  Additionally, they cannot pay interest, technically, because Islamic law forbids making money from money. Instead they set what is called an “expected profit rate” (EPR). As the accounts pay an EPR rather than interest, they are not included in our best-buy tables.  In theory, such rates are not set in stone and could change, although Gatehouse told Money it had never made such an alteration since it started to offer savings accounts in 2015.  “The sort of extreme circumstances that would cause the bank to alter the rates on its accounts would be the same circumstances that meant other banks may have to fall back on their FSCS protection, which is also available to Gatehouse Bank’s customers,” it said.  “In other words, the future of the banking system and UK economy would have to be in dire trouble. It’s therefore extremely unlikely that would ever happen, particularly given today’s more stringent capital requirements [the financial buffers needed by banks to protect them against economic risks].”  Al Rayan said it had never cut its EPRs and had actually increased them several times when its investments had performed better than expected.  If a bank did reduce its EPR, savers would be free to take out their cash without penalty if they did not want to accept the lower rate. The EPR would still be paid until that point.  Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts believes interest could grow in sharia accounts. “It wouldn’t be too surprising to see savers move their money away from high street brands and place it with these alternatives.  “If they keep offering savers good rates and decent service then the word of mouth will spread,” she said.  Sharia mortgages also work differently from conventional products. Rather than the customer paying interest on the loan, the bank and customer typically buy the property jointly, with each becoming a “beneficial owner” depending on the amount they have contributed.  The customer leases the part of the property owned by the bank and makes a monthly “rental payment”.  At the end of the finance term, if all the payments are made, ownership of the property transfers to the customer.  Aaron Strutt at the broker Trinity Financial said that his own company arranges few sharia mortgages.

473,1090387,"Drivers are told they will be rewarded with lower premiums if they have good habits.  But people are discovering that reductions are impossible to get and are being eroded by other fees. Sell your car, switch policy or breach the smallprint, and you could be hit with hefty penalties.  With most insurers you'll receive warnings if you break rules such as regularly driving at 40mph in a 30mph zone. If you ignore these alerts and carry on driving poorly, the insurer can fine you on a case-by-case basis.  In some instances, Money Mail understands, the fines can be as much as £100. In the worst cases it will cancel your policy.  iKube charges £100 a night if you drive outside of its curfew hours of 11pm to 5am.  Admiral, which provides cover through its Bell subsidiary, also only knocks more money off if you can drive more safely than rival policyholders. But this can make it difficult to grab a discount because many black box customers already tend to drive more cautiously.  Mike Powell, insurance analyst at research company Defaqto, says: 'Black box insurance carries so many fees and charges, they need to be made much, much clearer.  'It's very easy for drivers to be taken in by the technology, along with the promised drop in premiums, but they can end up paying out a lot more than they thought.'  Young, newly qualified motorists are increasingly faced with quotes of £2,500 or more for standard insurance. Black box cover is sold as the way to cut their costs.  It works a bit like the black box flight recorders in planes. A device about the size of a mobile phone is attached to your dashboard or under the steering wheel. A computer then uses satellite signals to monitor your driving. This includes how you brake and accelerate, speed, distance covered, time of day — even road position.  There are about a dozen companies offering black box cover. Four years ago, only 12,000 people had a policy, now the figure has soared to 290,000. Insurers claim that if you can prove yourself to be a low-risk driver the policies will reduce the cost of your cover. Research from comparison website Moneysupermarket suggests good motorists who used black box technology — also known as telematics — could have £212 knocked off their insurance.  But their premiums would start at £1,280 a year. This reflects the fact that nearly half of all policyholders are between 17 and 19 years old.  According to the Association of British Insurers, 18-year-old drivers are three times more likely to be involved in an accident than a 48-year-old. Young female drivers used to benefit from reduced premiums because they are so much less likely to have a serious accident. Today, insurers are barred from basing tariffs on sex, so black box technology is thought to be particularly attractive to women as a way of reducing costs.  But what many are discovering is that black box policies come with expensive traps to snag the unwary. They start from the day you sign up. All insurers hit you with fines of between £30 to £100 if you miss your appointment to have the box fitted. If you don't have the right documents to get it done — a driving licence, MoT and proof of ownership — there's another £30-£45 penalty.  If you buy a new car during the year, you'll have to pay to have your black box reinstalled. The Co-op charges £90, while the AA levies £120.  Shop around for a cheaper black box policy after a year, and you'll usually have to pay again. David Neave, director of black box software provider Wunelli, says: 'It's something insurers are working on — it's not ideal at all, but it will change.'  If you go back to ordinary car cover, then you'll pay up to £120 to have the box removed.  Although many policies carry clear fines, insurers also look at individual instances of bad driving. This is where fines for repeated poor behaviour can be levied.  Critically, you may not even be rewarded if you do drive well. Buried in Admiral's terms for Bell's policies, it says: 'We compare your driving with that of other customers and calculate a score based on how you drive — and how your driving compares to other customers. At renewal, we will use this score and performance group to determine if your renewal price should be discounted or increased.'  An Admiral spokesman says: 'Drivers' scores are compared against other driver scores and the best scores result in a higher discount.'  Not all policies reward a rapid improvement in driving. While some review your habits every month — and update how much you have to pay — others only do it once a year.  Graeme Trudgill, of the British Insurance Brokers' Association, says: 'Black box is still relatively new so many insurers are still exploring the options.  'Some insurers are waiting to see if it is simply only those drivers predisposed to driving cautiously anyway that will use it or if it will significantly change those less cautious drivers' behaviour too.'  s.dunn@dailymail.co.uk  © Daily Mail","DRIVERS who sign up for black box car cover can be hit with a £100 fine from their insurer if they speed, a Money Mail investigation has found.

DRIVERS who sign up for black box car cover can be hit with a £100 fine from their insurer if they speed, a Money Mail investigation has found.

Black box technology, which monitors the safety of your driving, is supposed to be the new way to get discounts on your insurance.
Drivers are told they will be rewarded with lower premiums if they have good habits.  But people are discovering that reductions are impossible to get and are being eroded by other fees. Sell your car, switch policy or breach the smallprint, and you could be hit with hefty penalties.  With most insurers you'll receive warnings if you break rules such as regularly driving at 40mph in a 30mph zone. If you ignore these alerts and carry on driving poorly, the insurer can fine you on a case-by-case basis.  In some instances, Money Mail understands, the fines can be as much as £100. In the worst cases it will cancel your policy.  iKube charges £100 a night if you drive outside of its curfew hours of 11pm to 5am.  Admiral, which provides cover through its Bell subsidiary, also only knocks more money off if you can drive more safely than rival policyholders. But this can make it difficult to grab a discount because many black box customers already tend to drive more cautiously.  Mike Powell, insurance analyst at research company Defaqto, says: 'Black box insurance carries so many fees and charges, they need to be made much, much clearer.  'It's very easy for drivers to be taken in by the technology, along with the promised drop in premiums, but they can end up paying out a lot more than they thought.'  Young, newly qualified motorists are increasingly faced with quotes of £2,500 or more for standard insurance. Black box cover is sold as the way to cut their costs.  It works a bit like the black box flight recorders in planes. A device about the size of a mobile phone is attached to your dashboard or under the steering wheel. A computer then uses satellite signals to monitor your driving. This includes how you brake and accelerate, speed, distance covered, time of day — even road position.  There are about a dozen companies offering black box cover. Four years ago, only 12,000 people had a policy, now the figure has soared to 290,000. Insurers claim that if you can prove yourself to be a low-risk driver the policies will reduce the cost of your cover.

However, when she started filling in the application form to claim additional national insurance credits, she realised that another complicated system stood in her way: child benefit. She was not able to get the credits because the children’s parents had not registered to receive the benefit. Her daughter Nicola, 40, did not qualify for it because she is classed as a high earner. Like many parents, Nicola did not fill in the child benefit form because, under rules introduced in 2013, she was not eligible for any money.  “She’s a very busy person in a high-pressure job, it’s just a lot of effort to get nothing back,” Janet says.

Some of the ads have promised to give away these ""miracle heaters"" for free, although you only actually get them that way if you buy the surrounding mantle, which will set you back about $300.  The device -- formally called a Roll-n-Glow Fireplace -- is a portable heater built to look like an actual fireplace. The ""miracle"" is the ""fireless flame,"" which basically is a fake fireplace; it doesn't appear to be much different than the film-loop fireplaces that some community television stations use as a backdrop when they don't have fresh programming over the holidays.

Don't believe the hype  If you're looking for some type of country, feel-good feeling from the Amish connection, you're stretching. Some Amish don't use electricity, so an electric heater made in China isn't too authentic; in fact, it's only the mantle that goes around the heating unit that is made by Amish craftsmen.

They can be boiled down to this line in the ad: ""Only uses about 9 cents electric an hour; so turn down your thermostat and never be cold again.""  U.S. Department of Energy studies show that space heaters save money only when they heat one room at a time, so that you take the heater with you and keep the neighboring rooms chilly. The Amish heater does roll, but it's a lot clunkier than most portable heaters; plus, that fake fireplace might look a bit goofy standing in the middle of the kitchen or laundry room when you need to warm those areas up.  Moreover, electric costs per hour vary not only by the setting you put the heater on, but also based on the electric rates where you live.  And then there's the claim that the Amish Fireplace produces ""an amazing 5,119 BTU.""  If you remember high-school science classes, you might recall that BTUs (British Thermal Units, a measure of heat created by burning any material) are standard. If you have a 1,500-watt heater -- the wattage of the Roll-n-Glow -- it's going to be capable of producing 5,119 BTU. That's also the BTU capability of the $35 space heater you can get on sale at local hardware stores, at big-box office-supply stores or anywhere heaters are sold. There is no type of heater that can miraculously convert 1,500 watts into more than 5,119 BTUs.  The heater does get the ""Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,"" but that doesn't mean as much as consumers might think. Basically, it means that a product is what it says it is; there's no judgment about ""miracles"" or the level of ""amazement"" a consumer will feel, but rather that the promises and directions are correct.  In the end, there may be a family argument to be had with Brenda and Larry, where she likes the idea of a fake fireplace instead of just a heater.

If you have a 1,500-watt heater -- the wattage of the Roll-n-Glow -- it's going to be capable of producing 5,119 BTU. That's also the BTU capability of the $35 space heater you can get on sale at local hardware stores, at big-box office-supply stores or anywhere heaters are sold. There is no type of heater that can miraculously convert 1,500 watts into more than 5,119 BTUs.  The heater does get the ""Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,"" but that doesn't mean as much as consumers might think. Basically, it means that a product is what it says it is; there's no judgment about ""miracles"" or the level of ""amazement"" a consumer will feel, but rather that the promises and directions are correct.  In the end, there may be a family argument to be had with Brenda and Larry, where she likes the idea of a fake fireplace instead of just a heater. That means the Amish fireplace is more decorating option than heating alternative. But it's hard to believe that a chilly consumer won't be happier giving up the Roll-n-Glow and buying a much cheaper, smaller, less-decorative space heater that can do the job just as well."
485,284459,"Meanwhile, the number of people looking to buy with a friend or a relative has doubled to 4 pc of all purchases.  This latter option is a practical solution to the problem of getting a foot on the housing ladder at a time when the average UK house price has hit £272,000, up almost 10 pc in a year.  David Hollingworth, director at mortgage broker London & Country, says: 'Buying with a parent, sibling or friend is not really any different to an unmarried couple buying a home together.  'If you feel confident that you can live together, then pooling resources is a good way to get the extra space you want, in the area you want, which you might not have been able to do alone.'  For mortgage lenders, there is certainly no difference: the joint application is viewed just as any other, and interest rates are no better or worse.  However, the legalities of buying together can be complicated.  When a couple buy a home, they are typically joint tenants. This means they both own the whole of the property and, if one person dies, their half passes automatically to the other.  If you are buying with a friend, then you're unlikely to want that arrangement.  Instead, cohabiting friends or siblings should be tenants in common.  This means you own a specified proportion of your home. Usually, this is 50 pc if two of you are buying together, but it can be whatever percentage you choose.  For example, if one of you earns significantly more, the higher earner might be paying a higher proportion of the deposit and mortgage repayments, and so you may decide on a two-thirds to one-third split.  You can have up to four owners on a property, but Mr Hollingworth points out that a lender will typically only take the two highest salaries into account for its calculations — so there's no point in 20 people getting together to try to buy a mansion.  Crucially, though, the mortgage provider doesn't care what your set-up is.  Regardless of whether you are married, related, or not, you are both jointly responsible for the mortgage — and if one person cannot keep up their share of the repayments, you will be equally liable.  It's something to bear in mind before committing. If you fall out irreparably and your former friend vanishes off the face of the Earth, the lender can come after you for the monthly payment.  Having a mortgage with someone means your finances become linked together, and it makes sense only to buy with someone who you can trust to pay their bills.  For household bills and mortgage repayments, it certainly makes sense to set up a joint bank account, into which you can both pay an agreed amount each month. You should also decide how you are going to deal with the inevitable extras such as house maintenance and repairs.  Of course, if you buy with a sibling or friend, then you know from the start that one day in the future you will most likely part ways, so you need to make plans for that eventuality.  Edward Allen, a solicitor at Boodle Hatfield , says: 'You need to set up a declaration of trust with your conveyancing solicitor. 'This is the place to lay down the main house rules and what happens in the event that one or both of you wants to sell up.'  The document costs in the region of £250 to draw up and is a bit like a pre-nuptial agreement for homeowners.  Mr Allen recommends it should stipulate a minimum period that you both need to remain at the property — usually a time frame that covers your initial fixed mortgage term, so you don't get stung by a hefty early repayment charge if someone wants to move out. The declaration usually lays out that if one person wants to move, then the other person gets first refusal on purchasing the whole property before it goes to open market.  And if both owners want the whole property, then a bidding system tends to be the fairest way to decide.  In this instance, both co-owners put a bid in to an independent solicitor and the person who bids the most gets the property.  In either case, says Mr Allen, you should get a minimum of three independent valuations on the home and take the average value as the resale price.  If one of you is moving on and the other is taking full ownership of the property, you will effectively be redeeming the mortgage and getting a new one, so you should consider the additional mortgage and conveyancing fees.  Mr Allen adds: 'You should also make an inventory of all the furnishings and items purchased for the home — whether they were joint purchases or individual — as you'll need to work out how to divide them up again.'  House rules are an important area to discuss, too. What are the rules regarding partners moving in and guests, partners, boyfriends/ girlfriends staying over? What about pets and smoking, and so on?  Buying with friends can be a great way to get on to the property ladder, but there are pitfalls if care is not taken to ensure all parties are happy and agreements are watertight.  h.black@dailymail.co.uk  © Daily Mail","SOARING house prices are forcing more buyers to pool cash with friends or family to take their first step on to the property ladder.

486,1251475,"The rule was supposed to protect shareholders’ interests but, as the SEC roundtable scheduled for today recognizes, the growing clout of proxy advisory firms has raised concerns that unintended, and adverse, consequences have resulted. The advice proxy advisory firms provide regarding environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) programs exemplifies the problems. The goal of ESG programs is to explicitly account for issues that some people believe are important and want to promote, which sometimes comes at the expense of financial returns.  Both ISS and Glass Lewis sponsor ESG programs; consequently, the firms have a preordained belief that pro-ESG proxy statements should be supported. Thus, their advice has clear bias on ESG issues that is not adequately disclosed. ESG criteria also raises fiduciary responsibility questions for institutional investors that the proxy advisory firms fail to fully appreciate.  From the perspective of the individual investor, voting in favor of specific ESG programs can make sense. Perhaps the ESG program will enhance profits, perhaps it won’t. Either way, individual investors know the constraints they are imposing, and bear the consequences from their actions.  This nexus does not hold for institutional investors, particularly public pension funds because pensioners typically have no other investment options – if you are a teacher in California, CalSTRS will manage your pension, you have no choice. Since public pension funds represent many individuals, it is inevitable that ESG policies and investing preferences will clash. For example, there is a growing push for CalPERS to divest from fossil fuel companies even though 67 percent of members surveyed by Spectrem Group in 2018 stated that the sector “is an essential element of a balanced, diversified portfolio”.  Further, many studies that have examined ESG (see here or here) have found that automatically screening out investment options, or imposing uneconomic constraints, harms financial results. SEC Commissioner Hester Peirce expressed these concerns at the 2018 Annual SEC Conference stating that: “the problems arise when those making the investment decisions are doing so on behalf of others who do not share their ESG objectives.…When a pension fund manager is making the decision to pursue her moral goals at the risk of financial return, the manager is putting other people’s retirements at risk.”  The large unfunded liabilities of public sector pension funds worsen these costs.  Take California as an example. As newly-elected CalPERS Board member Jason Perez estimated, the CalPERS ESG program toward tobacco cost the retirement fund $8 billion, which is sizable relative to California’s current unfunded liabilities of nearly $170 billion according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. The problem may even be worse than that. As I recently reported in my chart-book on California’s pension crisis, total public employee pension debt is really closer to $1 trillion using a more realistic market estimate.  The large fiscal hole leaves Californians with few good choices. If the state raises taxes, it would reduce overall economic prosperity, but if it fails to fully fund their pension obligations, then future public sector retirees will suffer greater economic insecurity. Given these difficult trade-offs, any policy that limits the public pension systems’ investment options, and costs potential returns, worsens California’s pension crisis.  Combining the potential investment losses with the diversity of opinions regarding contentious social issues, it is clear that ESG investing is inappropriate for public pension funds. However, it is unclear that either ISS or Glass Lewis account for the specific needs of public pension funds when advising institutional investors about ESG proxy statements. In fact, based on their own ESG programs, it is reasonable to conclude that both firms are biased toward supporting such programs despite the clear negative impact these policies have on public pension funds.  Without reforms that better align the interests of the proxy advisory firms and the interests of fund shareholders, these unnecessary costs will persist. To address the problems, several reforms are necessary.  For example, instead of assuming that the analyses of proxy advisory firms are objective, or allowing the proxy advisory firms to rely on their “general conflict of interest” statements, the SEC should require conflict of interest disclosures that are specific to the issue under evaluation. More relevant conflict of interest disclosures will help ensure that the investors relying on the proxy firms’ recommendations are aware of the proxy firm’s specific biases and potential conflicts of interest as it relates to the specific issue under consideration.  The SEC should also consider eliminating the requirement that institutional investors vote on all items on corporate proxy statements.

487,946584,"Together, they make about $50,000 annually, and manage to carve out $2,000 of that for the college accounts by limiting dinners out, restricting retirement investing and trimming other expenses that aren't as high on the priority list as an education for their son.    Now, though, as college plan investment results trickle in for 2005 and parents mull switching funds or plans, the Lupros are wondering whether Oregon's plan gives them the best possible deal.    ""I sure have not seen much growth over the past couple of years,"" Joel asks. He'd like to find an objective benchmark to compare his family's results with the norm for the aggressive option they've chosen. (Most parents in the Oregon plan have opted in recent years for the aggressive option, which invests their money mostly in stocks to maximize returns.)    Oregon's network of three plans allows penalty-free transfers from plan to plan once a year. Investors in broker-sold plans might have to pay a redemption penalty to transfer if they enrolled in deferred commission plans that offer Class B or Class C shares. Plan transfers from state to state also are allowed with a minimum of hassle.    The problem is that comparing total returns among various state plans is a nightmare of numbers and options. We couldn't find a Web site that did the job adequately for us.    So we narrowed the field to Oregon's plans and the best of the rest from other states -- an admittedly arbitrary list culled from our own research and others' ""best of"" compilations. Then we compared 2005 results for the most aggressive stock portfolio offered by each. We would have liked to compare returns over longer periods, but many of these plans are too new to have five-year or even three-year performance numbers.    As for benchmarks, the Standard & Poor's 500 is a guide for large-company stocks. It returned 4.91 percent last year. The Russell 2000 Index, which measures the performance of small company stocks, returned 4.55 percent last year. The Russell 3000 covers the middle ground, which did well last year at 6.12 percent. The measure for international stocks is the EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) Index, which grew 13.54 percent in 2005.    Most of the aggressive options we looked at beat all those indexes, except the EAFE, which is a good argument for including foreign stocks in your college plan mix.    But performance, while important, isn't nearly the whole story when it comes to college plans. Expenses and sales commissions are huge factors in how much you'll have when your child is ready to enroll. So, in the accompanying charts, we compared those, too.    The comparisons should help current investors who want to monitor their results as well as parents who haven't yet taken the plunge into a plan, dubbed ""529 plans"" for the tax code section that allows them. The plans let parents, grandparents or others add money in lumps or over time to funds that are invested in stocks or bonds, where it grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free as long as it's spent on college.    Forty-nine states offer the plans (Washington, which has a different program, is the exception) and many, including Oregon, give tax deductions for contributions. You can invest in any state's plan, although you'd forgo the tax deduction if you leave Oregon. You can spend the money on public or private colleges in any state.    Our calculations don't factor in the $2,000 annual state tax deduction Oregon allows. But if you did invest your maximum $180 annual tax savings and got an 8 percent return over 15 years -- the same assumptions we made in our other calculations -- you'd have an extra $5,598 you'd miss if you went with an out-of-state plan. The deduction could be raised to a maximum $4,000 for couples in the future if the Legislature approves, notes plan director Michael Parker, and that would double the potential impact on your returns.    The effects of sales commissions on total returns should persuade just about anyone to buy a plan, in Oregon or elsewhere, directly from the state program rather than through a broker. The difference that fees make over 15 years between Oregon's lowest-expense direct plan and highest-expense broker-sold plan is nearly $17,000.    If you want advice about which program or funds to use in your plan, hire a fee-only financial planner for occasional advice. If, instead, you buy your 529 plan through a broker, you could pay 5.75 percent on every nickel you invest and expenses that are two to three times those of low-expense direct plans.    So which direct plan is best for Oregonians? It's a close call and may reflect some native bias, but we end up liking Oregon's Vanguard options offered in a partnership with Oppenheimer, which combine low expenses, tax breaks and a decent choice of index funds that cover domestic and international markets. Oregon offers three plans: the direct plan through Oppenheimer that includes Oppenheimer and Vanguard fund choices, and broker-sold plans through Oppenheimer and MFS Investment Management.    Others who have studied college plans, including Dougal Williams, a financial analyst at Portland's Vista Capital Partners, come to different conclusions.    Williams likes Iowa's plan. He says it gives the best overall combination of diversified investment portfolios, low expenses and added benefits like Upromise, which lets participants rack up cash credits on store purchases for their college funds. But his biggest reason is that Iowa offers low-expense age-based portfolios, which progress from aggressive to conservative investments as the child nears college without the parent having to change the investment mix. Oregon's one age-based portfolio is done with Oppenheimer funds, which have higher expenses.    ""If someone is willing and able to manage and monitor their 529 plan's asset allocation, including rebalancing, then the Oregon plan's Vanguard portfolios are a good, low-cost option,"" Williams says. But he says it's been his experience that most people do better with the ""autopilot"" options of age-based portfolios.    Joel Lupro says he doesn't mind the couple of hours every year it takes to monitor his plan and change allocations if necessary.    ""I like having the control, and I don't have to make an appointment and meet with anyone. I don't think it's beyond my comprehension,"" says Lupro.    Comparing the expenses of Iowa's plans to a mix of Oregon's Vanguard options results in a dead heat. After 15 years of saving $2,000 and earning a hypothetical 8 percent, you'd have $86,297 in either account. The actual returns in 2005 would have been 7.54 percent for Oregon with a mix of 85 percent total stock market and 15 percent international index funds; and 7.14 percent for Iowa's aggressive age-based option.    Utah has the lowest expenses in the country, but Williams passed on recommending it to clients because it tacks on up to $25 annually for a maintenance fee, which raises the expense ratio to 0.94 percent on a $5,000 balance. Utah's program also concerned him because an administrator there was caught embezzling funds and fired in 2004.    Nevada has a wide range of funds, but offers fewer age-based options than Iowa and asks for a high initial investment of $3,000.    The only reason an Oregonian might favor the home state's Oppenheimer age-based portfolio over the Iowa option would be if he intended to make annual contributions of $2,000 or less. In that case, the benefit of Oregon's tax deduction overcomes the difference in expenses, Williams says.

The plans let parents, grandparents or others add money in lumps or over time to funds that are invested in stocks or bonds, where it grows tax-free and can be withdrawn tax-free as long as it's spent on college.    Forty-nine states offer the plans (Washington, which has a different program, is the exception) and many, including Oregon, give tax deductions for contributions. You can invest in any state's plan, although you'd forgo the tax deduction if you leave Oregon. You can spend the money on public or private colleges in any state.    Our calculations don't factor in the $2,000 annual state tax deduction Oregon allows. But if you did invest your maximum $180 annual tax savings and got an 8 percent return over 15 years -- the same assumptions we made in our other calculations -- you'd have an extra $5,598 you'd miss if you went with an out-of-state plan. The deduction could be raised to a maximum $4,000 for couples in the future if the Legislature approves, notes plan director Michael Parker, and that would double the potential impact on your returns.    The effects of sales commissions on total returns should persuade just about anyone to buy a plan, in Oregon or elsewhere, directly from the state program rather than through a broker. The difference that fees make over 15 years between Oregon's lowest-expense direct plan and highest-expense broker-sold plan is nearly $17,000.    If you want advice about which program or funds to use in your plan, hire a fee-only financial planner for occasional advice. If, instead, you buy your 529 plan through a broker, you could pay 5.75 percent on every nickel you invest and expenses that are two to three times those of low-expense direct plans.    So which direct plan is best for Oregonians? It's a close call and may reflect some native bias, but we end up liking Oregon's Vanguard options offered in a partnership with Oppenheimer, which combine low expenses, tax breaks and a decent choice of index funds that cover domestic and international markets. Oregon offers three plans: the direct plan through Oppenheimer that includes Oppenheimer and Vanguard fund choices, and broker-sold plans through Oppenheimer and MFS Investment Management.    Others who have studied college plans, including Dougal Williams, a financial analyst at Portland's Vista Capital Partners, come to different conclusions.    Williams likes Iowa's plan. He says it gives the best overall combination of diversified investment portfolios, low expenses and added benefits like Upromise, which lets participants rack up cash credits on store purchases for their college funds. But his biggest reason is that Iowa offers low-expense age-based portfolios, which progress from aggressive to conservative investments as the child nears college without the parent having to change the investment mix. Oregon's one age-based portfolio is done with Oppenheimer funds, which have higher expenses.    ""If someone is willing and able to manage and monitor their 529 plan's asset allocation, including rebalancing, then the Oregon plan's Vanguard portfolios are a good, low-cost option,"" Williams says. But he says it's been his experience that most people do better with the ""autopilot"" options of age-based portfolios.    Joel Lupro says he doesn't mind the couple of hours every year it takes to monitor his plan and change allocations if necessary.    ""I like having the control, and I don't have to make an appointment and meet with anyone. I don't think it's beyond my comprehension,"" says Lupro.    Comparing the expenses of Iowa's plans to a mix of Oregon's Vanguard options results in a dead heat. After 15 years of saving $2,000 and earning a hypothetical 8 percent, you'd have $86,297 in either account. The actual returns in 2005 would have been 7.54 percent for Oregon with a mix of 85 percent total stock market and 15 percent international index funds; and 7.14 percent for Iowa's aggressive age-based option.    Utah has the lowest expenses in the country, but Williams passed on recommending it to clients because it tacks on up to $25 annually for a maintenance fee, which raises the expense ratio to 0.94 percent on a $5,000 balance. Utah's program also concerned him because an administrator there was caught embezzling funds and fired in 2004.    Nevada has a wide range of funds, but offers fewer age-based options than Iowa and asks for a high initial investment of $3,000.    The only reason an Oregonian might favor the home state's Oppenheimer age-based portfolio over the Iowa option would be if he intended to make annual contributions of $2,000 or less. In that case, the benefit of Oregon's tax deduction overcomes the difference in expenses, Williams says.

488,232779,"Colorado health insurance exchange raises fees  Colorado health insurance exchanges raises fees that will be passed to consumers  By DONNA BRYSON  Associated Press  DENVER (AP) — The board of directors of Colorado's health insurance exchange has raised fees that will be passed on to consumers as it and other states face decreased federal funding and struggle to predict enrollment figures.  The hike in administrative fees to 3.5 percent from 1.4 percent of premiums means a family of four paying monthly premiums of $1,000 would see its assessment more than double from $14 a month to $35.  Connect for Health Colorado chief executive officer Kevin Patterson said Friday they chose the middle of three options presented by staff, one that brings Colorado, which had had among the lowest assessments fees in the nation, in line with the federal exchange's fee.  ""They didn't feel like it was the right time to go above what the federal exchange was charging,"" Patterson said. ""There are some things we need to prove to the public.""  Shoppers have encountered frustrating delays on the exchange. Patterson himself said he thought it took too long at 20 minutes for him to buy a policy on the site.  Patterson was Gov. John Hickenlooper's chief administrative officer before being named Connect for Health's CEO last month. He is the exchange's third leader since it was established under the Affordable Care Act, and he said Friday he would like the job permanently.  A limited state audit report of Connect for Health in December said financial controls were inadequate and more than $30 million in payments and contracts lacked proper documentation or procedural controls. State lawmakers have called for broader reviews. Still, Colorado's problems have been less severe than those associated with other exchanges.  Deborah Bachrach, a lawyer and former Medicaid director for the New York State Department of Health who now advises states on federal health reform, said that while consumers now might be concerned by rising fees, the goal was to improve the exchanges' ability to enroll more people who need health insurance. Some states are already seeing more plans coming onto the market.  ""More enrollees bring in more issuers. More issuers bring in more competition, which should bring premium costs down over time,"" she said.  Federal grants that helped more than a dozen states start their own insurance marketplaces are starting to run out, researchers Sean Miskell and Kevin Lucia of Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms said in an interview Friday.  Many, like Colorado, are considering raising fees. Some, like Rhode Island, are requesting state funding, a step Patterson said Colorado is not taking. Others, like Hawaii and Vermont, are looking to cut costs by transferring some of their operations, such as online platforms, to the federal government.  Lucia said that when the exchanges began, officials could only guess how many people would enroll and where they should set their assessment rates. Now, after two enrollment periods, the facts needed to shape business decisions are becoming clearer.  ""People always say the government should be more like private business,"" Miskell said. ""But the flip side of that is, sometimes, private businesses fail.""  Miskell said that with so much invested already in the Affordable Care Act, he is not concerned any exchange will fail.  In Colorado, Patterson's board on Thursday also increased a flat monthly fee charged on all private policies sold in the state from $1.25 to $1.80. That affects about 1.2 million policies.  Patterson added that his exchange, which currently gets no federal reimbursement for helping applicants sign up for Medicaid, was now seeking such support. As a first step, Patterson's staff must determine how many of the people who come to his assistance network, brokers, website and customer service center are advised they qualify and go on to receive public insurance.  Consultant Bachrach said Colorado is among several states that did not initially focus on the extent to which their exchange staff and technology would be working to help people sign up for Medicaid.","DENVER (AP) — In a story May 18 about health insurance exchange fees, The Associated Press misidentified a researcher from Georgetown University's Center on Health Insurance Reforms.

490,574649,"""We're not even through the first full quarter of this year and we've already surpassed the need for the entirety of last year which is what has spurred us to come to you today and say we need some help with this. We need to find some solutions,"" she said.  Dobbyn did not ask council for financial help.  Instead, she asked the city to undertake an 18-month pilot project during which water and sewer bills would be issued monthly - instead of quarterly - to the 50 tenants of Owen Sound not-for-profit housing, the 75 households in Grey County-owned units and any other city resident who has experienced arrears and wishes to opt in.  After asking staff questions about Dobbyn's proposal, council directed staff to present a report with more information to the corporate services committee.  Dobbyn said receiving monthly bills would make it easier for lowincome households to budget for the expense and serve as a reminder when prioritizing which bills to pay. Monthly billing would also allow people to identify leaks or billing problems sooner, she said, and seek assistance from social agencies earlier.  She said the pilot project would allow the city to see if there would be higher compliance with monthly billing. It would also tell the city if the higher costs to mail bills monthly would be offset by the reduction in costs for collectionrelated activities.  Corporate services director Kate Allan said it would cost the city significantly more money to have water meters read and bills issued monthly.  There are about 7,300 metered accounts in Owen Sound. A family of four, on average, was billed $1,165 last year for water/sewer costs.  Allan said there are seven billing cycles, which are based on geography. Meters in each area are read once per quarter and the contracted meter reader must be near the devices to pick up the signal. That means the meter reader is out 28 times a year.  The city's costs for quarterly billing is about $48,000 a year.  ""If we were to start doing them monthly, you would have to multiply that by four. So it's clearly more cost efficient to do it quarterly and timewise, resource-wise. We would probably have to hire more people if we were having to go out and read every meter once a month as opposed to once every three months,"" Allan said in an interview.  She said two households were cut off from city water due to non-payment in 2016 and five lost the service in 2015.  She said the city refers people to the United Way - as requested by the agency - if someone expresses a concern about being unable to pay their bill. The referral is typically made when a customer receives their first delinquent account notice, she said, and not at the disconnection stage.  Allan said the majority of water/sewer users are landowners. If those customers fall behind on their bills, the city can transfer the arrears to their property taxes.  There are few costs associated with trying to collect water/sewer bill arrears, she said. Allan said all customers have the option to make monthly payments to the city towards their water/sewer costs.  City manager Wayne Ritchie said staff go ""above and beyond"" to help people avoid disconnection.  Dobbyn told council the reason it had so few disconnections is because the United Way stepped in to help people with arrears.

Dobbyn said the United Way was able to help all 16 households that received water/sewer bill assistance last year avoid a disconnection. The average paid was $451. Households that requested the help had an average annual income of just under $20,000, she said, and average rent or mortgage of $1,000 a month.  Dobbyn said other social service agencies provided $9,000 to help people in 2016 with city water/sewer bill arrears.

The only limitation here is that the travel in question must have been at least 40 kilometres.    Consider the following case. Joshua was attending school in Toronto, but got a very well paid job planting trees in British Columbia for the summer. As the employer did not pay for the trip to B.C., the costs associated with travelling there were deductible against the income earned. This, of course, involves the basic moving expense claim available to anybody.    But when he moved back to Toronto, the costs associated with that move were also deductible, because he did have income from a part-time job in Toronto. He could use the moving expenses against that income as well.

497,1442392,"After the officer filed a grievance, the Oak Bay police union took the issue back to the department, which again put it before the police board.  For a second time, the board, which acts as the employer, denied the officer's request.  ""The board's position on retirement at age 60 is in keeping with the negotiated terms of the collective agreement,"" Oak Bay Mayor Nils Jensen, a board member, said in an email.  Oak Bay Police Chief Andrew Brinton said he can't speak to specifics because of privacy concerns, but confirmed a personnel matter related to retirement as set out in the collective agreement was discussed by the police board at in-camera meetings April through June.  The mandatory age of retirement was upheld by the department and board, said Brinton.  There have been no retirements at the department since last summer, he said.  ""The board simply felt it is part of the collective agreement and it would be inappropriate to step away form it,"" said Brinton.  He said the board's decision was based in part on a B.C. Human Rights Tribunal decision last year related to a Vancouver firefighter who claimed age discrimination.  ""That's confirmed in the minds of many there is a contractual arrangement that all parties have agreed to going into their employment,"" said Brinton.  On June 26, the Human Rights Tribunal dismissed an age discrimination complaint by John Yaremy, a firefighter employed by the City of Vancouver and a member of the Vancouver Fire Fighters' Union, Local 18.  Yaremy lost his job when he turned 60. The collective agreement between the City of Vancouver and the union requires all firefighters regardless of classification, gender, or department of service to retire at age 60.  The city and union said that the actuarially based supplemental pension system that confirmed the early retirement of firefighters at age 60 dates to arrangements dating to the early 1900s.  Stephanie Gutierrez, a labour and human rights lawyer in Vancouver, said there have been challenges of the retirement at 60 requirement, but they have been unsuccessful. ""Essentially under our human rights legislation, which is not too dissimilar from human rights legislation across the country, we have a provision that a person must not discriminate in employment on various grounds including age, except that prohibition does not apply with age and other grounds for the operation of bona fide retirement, superannuation or pension plan or bona fide employee insurance plan,"" Gutierrez said.  B.C. Police Association president Tom Stamatakis said most police officers with 25 to 30 years on the job are ready to retire. ""Most retire before age 60,"" said Stamatakis. ""Most benefits and pension plans are structured around age 60.""  Stamatakis points to the increased costs to benefits and pension plan premiums that come with people working longer and the physical toll that the job itself and shift work takes. ""You are allowed to discriminate based on age where there is a bona fide employment requirement - for a firefighter, paramedic and police officer,"" said Stamatakis.  He said firefighters have challenged the collective agreement but he's not aware of police officers doing so.  In Victoria, at least one officer wanted to work beyond age 60 and an exception was made. Victoria police spokesman Const. Matt Rutherford said the retirement age for Victoria police officers is subject to their collective agreement, arrived at through negotiations between the Victoria Police Department and the Victoria police union. That negotiated retirement age is 60.  However, ""the department and the police union may agree on exceptions from time to time,"" said Rutherford.  ""There are many factors that are considered during these types of discussions,"" said Rutherford. ""At present, the department has one officer over the age of 60.""

The Oak Bay Police Board has twice rejected an officer's desire to work past the age of 60.

The police board denied the officer's request to work beyond age 60 because of a contractual mandatory age of retirement.
After the officer filed a grievance, the Oak Bay police union took the issue back to the department, which again put it before the police board.  For a second time, the board, which acts as the employer, denied the officer's request.  ""The board's position on retirement at age 60 is in keeping with the negotiated terms of the collective agreement,"" Oak Bay Mayor Nils Jensen, a board member, said in an email.  Oak Bay Police Chief Andrew Brinton said he can't speak to specifics because of privacy concerns, but confirmed a personnel matter related to retirement as set out in the collective agreement was discussed by the police board at in-camera meetings April through June.  The mandatory age of retirement was upheld by the department and board, said Brinton.  There have been no retirements at the department since last summer, he said.  ""The board simply felt it is part of the collective agreement and it would be inappropriate to step away form it,"" said Brinton.  He said the board's decision was based in part on a B.C. Human Rights Tribunal decision last year related to a Vancouver firefighter who claimed age discrimination.  ""That's confirmed in the minds of many there is a contractual arrangement that all parties have agreed to going into their employment,"" said Brinton.  On June 26, the Human Rights Tribunal dismissed an age discrimination complaint by John Yaremy, a firefighter employed by the City of Vancouver and a member of the Vancouver Fire Fighters' Union, Local 18.  Yaremy lost his job when he turned 60. The collective agreement between the City of Vancouver and the union requires all firefighters regardless of classification, gender, or department of service to retire at age 60.  The city and union said that the actuarially based supplemental pension system that confirmed the early retirement of firefighters at age 60 dates to arrangements dating to the early 1900s.  Stephanie Gutierrez, a labour and human rights lawyer in Vancouver, said there have been challenges of the retirement at 60 requirement, but they have been unsuccessful. ""Essentially under our human rights legislation, which is not too dissimilar from human rights legislation across the country, we have a provision that a person must not discriminate in employment on various grounds including age, except that prohibition does not apply with age and other grounds for the operation of bona fide retirement, superannuation or pension plan or bona fide employee insurance plan,"" Gutierrez said.  B.C. Police Association president Tom Stamatakis said most police officers with 25 to 30 years on the job are ready to retire. ""Most retire before age 60,"" said Stamatakis. ""Most benefits and pension plans are structured around age 60.""  Stamatakis points to the increased costs to benefits and pension plan premiums that come with people working longer and the physical toll that the job itself and shift work takes. ""You are allowed to discriminate based on age where there is a bona fide employment requirement - for a firefighter, paramedic and police officer,"" said Stamatakis.  He said firefighters have challenged the collective agreement but he's not aware of police officers doing so.  In Victoria, at least one officer wanted to work beyond age 60 and an exception was made. Victoria police spokesman Const. Matt Rutherford said the retirement age for Victoria police officers is subject to their collective agreement, arrived at through negotiations between the Victoria Police Department and the Victoria police union. That negotiated retirement age is 60.  However, ""the department and the police union may agree on exceptions from time to time,"" said Rutherford.  ""There are many factors that are considered during these types of discussions,"" said Rutherford. ""At present, the department has one officer over the age of 60."" Details are confidential, said Rutherford.  Brinton said he couldn't talk about what other departments do around the issue of mandatory age retirements. ""That's up to each police board how they want to manage it,"" said Brinton. ""In the case of Oak Bay all I can say is they chose to stay in line with the collective agreement and there have been recent decisions in the province to support that.""  ceharnett@timescolonist.com( mailto:ceharnett@timescolonist.com )"

The scheduled maturity date (the ""Scheduled Maturity Date"") of the ETC Securities is 23 May 2118.  C.1.3 Rights attached to the ETC Securities  Overview  The ETC Securities are designed to provide purchasers with exposure to Gold without having to take physical delivery of the Gold. The Issuer, under the Programme, may only issue ETC Securities to authorised participants appointed as such (each, an ""Authorised Participant""). Authorised Participants may, thereafter, offer such ETC Securities to retail clients, professional clients or other eligible counterparties (subject to certain selling restrictions contained in the Base Prospectus). The first tranche of the Series was issued on 23 May 2019 (the ""Series Issue Date "") to one or more Authorised Participants.  Each ETC Security relates to a specific amount in weight of Gold, specified in the Final Terms, known as the ""Metal Entitlement"". In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities, the Issuer will seek to hold enough Gold to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. On the Series Issue Date, each ETC Security was ascribed with a Metal Entitlement (the ""Initial Metal Entitlement"") and on each subsequent day, the Metal Entitlement of each ETC Security shall be reduced by a percentage (the ""Total Expense Ratio"") determined as sufficient to fund the Issuer's ""all in one"" operational fee to Amundi Asset Management S.A.S (the ""Advisor""). In order to fund such ""all in one"" operational fee, HSBC Bank plc (the ""Metal Counterparty"") shall periodically liquidate an amount of Gold (the ""TER Metal"") equal to the accrued reductions (pursuant to the Total Expense Ratio) to the Metal Entitlement of all ETC Securities of the Series. The Total Expense Ratio shall cease to apply to an ETC Security for a Series on the earliest to occur of (i) a Buy-Back Trade Date relating to such ETC Security, (ii) an Early Redemption Trade Date relating to such Series and (iii) the Final Redemption Valuation Date for such Series. The Gold will be held for the Issuer by HSBC Bank plc (the ""Custodian "") and will generally be held on an ""allocated"" basis on the terms of the Custody Agreement in the relevant allocated account of the Issuer with the Custodian marked for the relevant series (the ""Allocated Account""). This means that the Gold is held in a segregated account held at the London vault of the Custodian in the name of the Issuer for the account of the relevant Series and all Gold in allocated form that is deposited with or received by the Custodian from time to time is held by the Custodian as bailee for the Issuer for that Series. There are times when amounts of the Gold may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis, for example to facilitate subscriptions.  Subscription   Amundi Physical Metals plc: Final Terms -3-  On any day (other than a Saturday or a Sunday) on which (i) Euronext Paris is open for business, (ii) the over-the-counter market of The London Bullion Market Association (the ""LBMA"") is open for business and (iii) commercial banks in Ireland are open for business (a ""Business Day""), an Authorised Participant may request the Issuer to issue further ETC Securities to such Authorised Participant (a ""Subscription""). Prior to settlement of a Subscription, the Authorised Participant will be required to transfer to an unallocated account of the Issuer with the Custodian marked for such Series (the ""Unallocated Account"") an amount of Gold (the ""Subscription Settlement Amount"") equal to the product of (a) the Metal Entitlement on the relevant trade date (the ""Subscription Trade Date"") and (b) the total number of ETC Securities being issued. The Issuer will not issue ETC Securities to an Authorised Participant until the Subscription Settlement Amount has been received in the Unallocated Account and allocated to the Allocated Account for the Series. In connection with each Subscription, the Authorised Participant will also be required to pay to the Issuer a subscription fee (the ""Subscription Fee"").  Buy-Backs  On any Business Day, an Authorised Participant may request that the Issuer buys back ETC Securities from such Authorised Participant (a ""Buy-Back""). Prior to settlement of a Buy-Back, the Authorised Participant will be required to deliver to the Issuing and Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer the relevant ETC Securities being bought back. The Issuer will not cancel such ETC Securities and deliver to the Authorised Participant an amount of Gold (the ""Buy-Back Settlement Amount"") equal to the product of (1) the Metal Entitlement on the relevant trade date (the ""Buy-Back Trade Date"") and (2) the total number of ETC Securities being bought back, until the Issuing and Paying Agent has confirmed receipt of such ETC Securities. In connection with each Buy-Back, the Authorised Participant will also be required to pay to the Issuer a buy-back fee (the ""Buy-Back Fee"").  Future Buy-Backs and Early and Final Redemption  At any given time, the Gold standing to the credit of the Allocated Account should at least equal the aggregate Metal Entitlement for all ETC Securities still outstanding for such Series. Such Gold will fund the delivery of any future Buy-Back Settlement Amounts and the payment of any ""Early Redemption Amount"" or ""Final Redemption Amount"" (each as defined below) in respect of each ETC Security.  Security  The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and the underlying Gold. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not, by reason of holding such Series, have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security over the Secured Property in respect of a Series of ETC Securities will become enforceable if payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, is not made in full when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the relevant Early Redemption Settlement Date, as applicable.  Limited Recourse and Ranking  The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of Securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such, once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed, none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors, officers, members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and, therefore, the rights of Securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions, the Securityholders of a Series may not receive in full the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security of such Series if the proceeds of the Secured Property are insufficient to meet the claims of all secured creditors of such Series.  Interest  The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest but the Early Redemption Amount or Final Redemption Amount, as applicable, may incorporate an interest redemption premium to the extent such Early Redemption Amount or Final Redemption Amount, as applicable, exceeds the issue price per ETC Security for the first tranche of the Series.  Where the value of the Metal comprising the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is trading at or below an amount equal to the Nominal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (each as defined below), a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security, as the case may be, which amount shall represent interest on the Nominal Amount.  Final Redemption of the ETC Securities  Unless previously redeemed in whole or purchased and cancelled by the Issuer, each ETC Security will become due and payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date at its Final Redemption Amount.  The ""Final Redemption Amount"" for a Series shall be an amount (which amount may incorporate an interest redemption premium, being any excess over the issue price per ETC Security for the first tranche of such Series) denominated in USD per ETC Security equal to the greater of: i. the product of (a) the Metal Entitlement (expressed in fine troy ounces) as at the date falling 40Business Days prior to the scheduled maturity date (the ""Final Redemption Valuation Date"", subject to postponementin certain circumstances) and (b) the average price ascribed to each fine troy ounce of Metal held in the AllocatedAccount on the Final Redemption Valuation Date based on (1) the proceeds received on any Metal sold prior to thefifth Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled maturity date and (2) the reference price for the Metal aspublished on the relevant price source for such Series (or any successor or replacement price source) in respect ofany Metal not sold prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled maturity date; and ii. an amount equal to 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security on the Series Issue Date (the ""Nominal Amount"") plus an amount equal to 1 per cent. of the Nominal Amount (the ""Specified Interest Amount"").  Early Redemption of the ETC Securities  The ETC Securities shall become due and payable prior to their scheduled maturity date at its Early Redemption Amount due to the occurrence of any of the following events if, following the occurrence of any such event, the Issuer (and/or, in the case of a Market Value Redemption Event or an Event of Default, the Trustee following requisite direction by the Securityholders) has given notice designating an early redemption of the ETC Securities in full: i. the Issuer at any time and for any reason elects to early redeem the ETC Securities in full (an ""IssuerCall Redemption Event""); ii. on the next date on which a delivery of Metal is due (whether in respect of a Subscription, a Buy-Back ora sale of TER Metal), the Issuer is, or there is a substantial likelihood that it will be, required to make paymentin respect of VAT or register for VAT or otherwise account for VAT on such delivery of Metal, or the Issuer hasbecome liable, or become aware that it is liable, for VAT in respect of a prior delivery of Metal (a ""VATRedemption Event""); iii. certain key service providers of the Issuer resign or their appointment in relation to such Series isterminated for any reason and no successor or replacement has been appointed within 120 calendar days (a ""ServiceProvider Non-Replacement Redemption Event""); iv. the prevailing value of an ETC Security on two consecutive non-disrupted days (calculated by theAdministrator by reference to each ETC Security's Metal Entitlement and the ""Metal Reference Price"" (being the LBMAGold Price or such successor Metal Reference Price as may be determined from time to time) on each suchnon-disrupted day) is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security (calculated byreference to each ETC Security's Metal Entitlement and the Metal Reference Price) as at the Series Issue Date (a ""Market Value Redemption Event""); or v. an event of default occurs including certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not curedwithin the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer (an ""Event of Default"").  The ""Early Redemption Amount"" shall be an amount (which amount may incorporate an interest redemption premium, being any excess over the issue price per ETC Security for the first tranche of such Series) denominated in USD per ETC Security equal to the greater of: i. the product of (a) the Metal Entitlement (expressed in fine troy ounces) as at the date specified in therelevant notice designating an Issuer Call Redemption Event, a VAT Redemption Event, a Service ProviderNon-Replacement Redemption Event, a Market Value Redemption Event or an Event of Default, as applicable (the ""EarlyRedemption Trade Date"", subject to postponement in certain circumstances) and (b) the average price ascribed toeach fine troy ounce of Metal held in the Allocated Account on the Early Redemption Trade Date based on (1) theproceeds received on any Metal sold prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the 40th Business Dayfollowing the Early Redemption Trade Date (such 40th Business Day following the Early Redemption Trade Date, the ""Metal Sale Cut-Off Date"") and (2) the reference price for the Metal as published on the relevant price source forsuch Series (or any successor or replacement price source) in respect of any Metal not sold   Amundi Physical Metals plc: Final Terms -4-  prior to the fifthBusiness Day immediately preceding the Metal Sale Cut-Off Date; and ii. the Nominal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount.  Payment of any Early Redemption Amount or the Final Redemption Amount is subject at all times to the limited recourse provisions.  Withholding Tax  All payments in respect of the ETC Securities will be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any taxes. In the event that any withholding, reduction or deduction for, or on account of, any tax applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities of any Series, the Securityholders will be subject to such tax or reduction or deduction and will not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or reduction or deduction. No Event of Default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction.  Governing Law  The ETC Securities will be governed by Irish law. There will be two security trust deeds relating to each Series of ETC Securities - one will be governed by Irish law and the other will be governed by English law.  C.1.4 Rank of the ETC Securities in the Issuer's capital structure upon insolvency  The ETC Securities are secured, limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and the ETC Securities of a series rank equally amongst themselves. The obligations of the Issuer in respect of a Series are secured by the Secured Property. The security over the Secured Property in respect of a Series will become enforceable if payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount, as applicable, is not made in full when due on the scheduled maturity date or the relevant early redemption settlement date, as applicable.  C.1.5 Restrictions on free transferability of the securities  Interests in ETC Securities traded in any clearing system will be transferred in accordance with the procedures and regulations of that clearing system. The ETC Securities will be freely transferable, subject to certain restrictions on sales of ETC Securities into, amongst other jurisdictions, the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, Switzerland and any European Economic Area countries to whose competent authority the Base Prospectus has not been notified or passported. These restrictions are mainly targeting offerings to the public in such jurisdictions unless certain exemptions apply although some of the restrictions are blanket prohibitions on the offering of the ETC Securities in the relevant jurisdiction. The ETC Securities are subject to U.S. tax law requirements.  C.2 Where will the ETC Securities be traded?  Application has been made for the ETC Securities to be admitted to listing on, and trading on the regulated markets of, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam and the Deutsche Börse, and to listing on and trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. The ETC Securities may also be listed and/or admitted to trading on such other or further stock exchanges as may be agreed between the Issuer and the Arranger at some point in the future.  C.3 What are the key risks that are specific to the ETC Securities?  -- The value, the secondary market price and the Early Redemption Amount or Final Redemption Amount, asapplicable, of each ETC Security of a Series will be affected by movements in the price of the Metal, marketperception, the creditworthiness of certain transaction parties and the liquidity of the ETC Securities in thesecondary market. The price of the Metal (and, by extension, the price of the ETC Security) can go down as well asup and the performance of the Metal in any future period may not mirror its past performance.  -- Gold is generally more volatile than most other asset classes, making investments in Gold riskier andmore complex than other investments, and the secondary market price of the ETC Securities may demonstrate similarvolatility.  -- The reduction of the Metal Entitlement by the Total Expense Ratio and the impositi",,,,0,
499,732928,"--Portfolio includes smaller issues missed by larger funds        By Murray Coleman     Lofty demand for non-investment-grade corporate debt and shrinking yields might have some investors worried such so-called junk bonds have seen better days.  But don't tell that to Carl Kaufman. The longtime manager of the $3.1 billion Osterweis Strategic Income Fund (OSTIX) is taking a wide-ranging mandate to steer most of the portfolio's assets into lower-rated issues.  The risks are apparent. Although investors have cooled a bit in recent weeks, last year's $28.9 billion in net inflows for high-yield corporate bonds was more than double 2011's total, according to Lipper data. Demand remains positive this year, even as rising prices keep pressuring yields.  Mr. Kaufman, who typically keeps his portfolio at a relatively compact 100 issues or so, said he still is finding select opportunities in junk bonds at attractive prices.  ""Corporate America has undergone a massive refinancing effort, and that includes non-investment-grade issuers,"" he said. ""In effect, they've pushed maturities out so that the next big wave won't come due until 2017.""  The bottom line is that even when rates start rising, ""a lot of companies are still going to be well-positioned to offer non-investment-grade debt at appealing levels,"" Mr. Kaufman added.  One of his favorites in the portfolio is information technology provider Unisys Corp. (UIS). ""It has three times as much cash as debt, but it's not considered investment-grade by the ratings agencies,"" Mr. Kaufman said. ""We just don't think it's in any jeopardy of going bankrupt and we're getting a coupon of 4.25% at today's prices.""  He is also bullish on Horsehead Holding Corp. (ZINC). ""It's the dominant zinc dust processor in the U.S. and has been around for more than 150 years,"" Mr. Kaufman said. ""It has a lot of cash and very little debt.""  In order to fund a new plant, the firm came to market with an issue of about $175 million last year, he noted. Although relatively small in size, Mr. Kaufman estimates it should wind up yielding around 11% for the fund's investors.  Osterweis Strategic Income is reaching for such plump yields in a somewhat-reserved fashion. While most of its assets are invested in junk bonds, the portfolio's effective duration--a measure of interest rate sensitivity--has been running around two years. That's about half of the exposure of a widely followed Merrill Lynch benchmark of U.S. corporate high-yield bonds.  ""If we see markets melt, the fund will be less impacted and should show less volatility,"" Mr. Kaufman said.  Another benefit he sees in keeping durations lower is that investors aren't losing much income as compared to a typical longer-dated fund. Based on benchmarks he tracks, Mr. Kaufman estimates that the payout difference between an intermediate-term junk bond and a short-term rival is less than half a percentage point.  ""Kaufman is a patient investor--he doesn't follow skyrocketing markets higher, and he keeps his powder dry to find the best deals,"" said Rick Vollaro, chief investment strategist at Pinnacle Advisory Group in Columbia, Md. The firm, which manages about $1 billion in assets, owns the fund in client accounts.  In the past 10 years, Osterweis Strategic Income had generated an average annual return of 7.9% entering Wednesday, topping a typical multi-sector bond fund's 7.4% gain, Morningstar data showed. The investment-grade tracking Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund (VBMFX) gained nearly 5% in that period.  ""We're still finding companies that are generating strong cash flows with little debt flying under the radar screen,"" Mr. Kaufman said.

500,1308854,"When should I start taking my benefits? You can take Social Security once you reach 62, but if you wait until your full retirement age, which will probably be between 66 and 67, you'll get much bigger monthly checks, and if you wait until 70, you'll get the biggest possible payments. Before deciding when to begin receiving your benefits, you'll need to weigh a few factors, including your estimated longevity and your other sources of income.  How should I consider potential spousal benefits? If you are married, or if you're divorced but were married for at least 10 years, you could receive up to half of your spouse's full retirement benefit (offset by your own benefit, and reduced if you claim early). If you outlive your spouse, you could claim survivor benefits, which can provide either your own benefits or 100% of your deceased spouse's, whichever is larger. Consequently, the higher-earning spouse might want to postpone taking benefits for as long as possible to maximize the survivor benefit.  How much can I earn without reducing my Social Security benefits? If you are younger than your full retirement age and you are receiving Social Security, the Social Security Administration will withhold $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn over a certain threshold (which, in 2019, is $17,640). For the year you reach your full retirement age, your benefits could be withheld by $1 for every $3 you earn over $46,920. But once you reach your full retirement age, you can earn as much as you want without your benefits being withheld, although your benefits could still be taxed, depending on your income.  How much of my pre-retirement income will Social Security replace? Generally speaking, you should expect Social Security to replace slightly more than a third of your pre-retirement income. However, the higher your income during your working years, the lower the replacement value of Social Security will be.  What other sources of retirement income should I develop?Contribute as much as you can afford to your IRA and your 401(k) or similar employer-sponsored retirement plan.

501,449439,"QUESTION: I'm paying the minimum amount each month on my 36-month interest-free purchase of furniture, which cost $5500. Is this enough to avoid interest?  ANSWER: No, the minimum amount each month is not nearly enough to pay off the purchase price in time. When the interest-free period is up, you'll be expected to pay a lot -- the full balance of the loan.  QUESTION: I went to buy a chandelier, which was advertised at a discount of 15 per cent, on my credit card. At the cash register, I changed my mind and asked to buy it on their interest-free offer. The store told me the discount wasn't available if I bought on an interest-free loan. Can they do that?  ANSWER: The store should point out that exclusion in their advertisements, otherwise it's misleading for customers. It shows how the costs can be built in to interest-free deals. Not a fair practice. I'd report them to Fair Trading.  QUESTION: I'm having a dispute about an outstanding amount on my interest-free purchase, which I thought I'd paid out. As the months go by, that originally small amount is blowing out, but they still refuse to drop the charge.  ANSWER: At 27 per cent interest, it's easy to see how even a tiny amount can multiply to a huge sum over time. Write immediately asking for an official explanation of the charges, and request to have them dropped. You could elect to pay the amount they claim is owing and take the matter to Fair Trading for resolution. It pays to read the fine print of interest-free contracts.","QUESTION: 24 months interest-free seems too good to be true. Is it?

ANSWER: If you play strictly by the rules, interest-free deals offered by large stores can be a good way to buy what you need, but can't afford at the time. Apart from a monthly administration fee of a few dollars, try to pay instalments each month of at least one 24th of the total amount, to completely pay out the loan within the interest-free period. If not, you'll incur interest on the balance of up to 28 per cent!

QUESTION: 24 months interest-free seems too good to be true. Is it?

ANSWER: If you play strictly by the rules, interest-free deals offered by large stores can be a good way to buy what you need, but can't afford at the time. Apart from a monthly administration fee of a few dollars, try to pay instalments each month of at least one 24th of the total amount, to completely pay out the loan within the interest-free period. If not, you'll incur interest on the balance of up to 28 per cent! If you lose your job and get stuck with that high interest, it could send you broke.
QUESTION: I'm paying the minimum amount each month on my 36-month interest-free purchase of furniture, which cost $5500. Is this enough to avoid interest?  ANSWER: No, the minimum amount each month is not nearly enough to pay off the purchase price in time. When the interest-free period is up, you'll be expected to pay a lot -- the full balance of the loan.  QUESTION: I went to buy a chandelier, which was advertised at a discount of 15 per cent, on my credit card. At the cash register, I changed my mind and asked to buy it on their interest-free offer. The store told me the discount wasn't available if I bought on an interest-free loan. Can they do that?  ANSWER: The store should point out that exclusion in their advertisements, otherwise it's misleading for customers. It shows how the costs can be built in to interest-free deals. Not a fair practice. I'd report them to Fair Trading.  QUESTION: I'm having a dispute about an outstanding amount on my interest-free purchase, which I thought I'd paid out. As the months go by, that originally small amount is blowing out, but they still refuse to drop the charge.  ANSWER: At 27 per cent interest, it's easy to see how even a tiny amount can multiply to a huge sum over time. Write immediately asking for an official explanation of the charges, and request to have them dropped. You could elect to pay the amount they claim is owing and take the matter to Fair Trading for resolution. It pays to read the fine print of interest-free contracts."

510,824727,"401(k), 403(b), 457 plans  For 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans, the contribution limit for 2014 is $17,500 with a catch up contribution of $5,500 for those that are age 50 and older. For 2015, the new contribution limits are $18,000 and $6,000 for the catch up contribution, for a total of $24,000, a $1,000 total increase. For those that have both a 457 plan and either a 401(k) or 403(b) – you have the potential to double your total contributions. In other words, you can contribute $36,000 or as much as $48,000 if 50 or older in 2015.  SIMPLE  The contribution limits change slightly for those that participate in a SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match PLan for Employee), $12,500 in 2014, with a $2,500 catch up contribution. For 2015, those contributions increased by $500, so $13,000 and $3,000 catch up.  IRA  No change for 2015 for both Traditional and Roth IRA contribution limits. Both remain at $5,500 contribution limits with the catch up contribution staying put at $1,000 ($6,500 total). We'll touch on contribution rules for both Traditional and Roth IRAs as far as how they apply to income limits and those participating in a 401(k) or 403(b) later in this article.  SEP IRA & Solo 401(k)  These business owner plans have increased their contribution limits for 2015. For SEP IRA, the maximum contribution increases from $52,000 (2014), to $53,000 in 2015. There is a formula that will calculate how much you can contribute so check with a tax professional for specific contribution information related to your business income.  For Solo 401(k) plans, the increase is from $52,000 to $53,000 for 2015. You can contribute an additional $6,000 in catch up contributions, $59,000 total for 2015, this includes profit sharing plan contributions in addition to your contribution as a participant.  Contributing to an IRA and company retirement plan  If you work, or your spouse works, your deduction for contributing to your IRA could be affected depending on whether you or your spouse has a retirement plan at work.  First off, whether you are single or married, if you and your spouse has a retirement plan then you can make a contribution to an IRA that's fully deductible.  On the other hand, if you are married and have a retirement plan, you will be allowed to fully deduct your IRA contribution if your modified AGI is $96k or less in 2014 ($98k in 2015), and no deduction for those with income above $116k ($118k-2015). For single individuals, that modified AGI is $60k or less for 2014 ($61k-2015) for a full deduction, and no deduction for income above $70k ($71k-2015).  If your spouse is covered, but you are not, then those income limits differ. For the one not covered by a retirement plan, $181k ($183k-2015) is the 2014 income limit for those allowed a full deduction, with no deduction of income $191k or more ($193k-2015).  I'll be the first one to admit this can be confusing. For more information, go to IRS.gov or talk to a tax professional or financial adviser.  Contributing to a Roth IRA and a Retirement plan  For those who wish to contribute to a Roth IRA, there is some flexibility if you are participating in your company retirement plan. You are able to contribute to both as long as you are below a certain income amount. For single individuals that have a Modified AGI of less than $114,000 ($116,000 for 2015) are able to contribute to a Roth IRA. With married individuals, that modified AGI number is $181,000 ($183k for 2015).  *Note: Modified Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is adjusted gross income subtracted by certain items such as student loan interest, qualified tuition expenses, one half of self-employment tax, and more. For a complete description, I encourage you to visit www.IRS.gov.  Summary  It's important to take advantage of these contribution limits and make sure you are updating your contribution amounts to reflect the increased contribution limits for the new year. In addition, there is still time to make modifications to your retirement savings this year. Now is great time to make sure you are maximizing your contributions and uncovering all of your options when it comes to saving for retirement.","The IRS recently announced 2015 contribution limits for various retirement plans.

You may also have life insurance through work, or your estate could get a lump sum from travel insurance if you die while away.  A simple will is fine if you don’t have too many complications, such as trusts, second marriages, blended families, or cutting someone out who might expect to benefit. In that case, says Jennifer Tweed, Perpetual Guardian’s national manager retail you may need a complete estate-planning review covering wills, trusts, and powers of attorney.  Although it’s a rare occurrence, wills can be challenged in the courts, says Talivai. It’s one reason why trusts have been popular, although some are now choosing to wind them up because of increased compliance requirements in the New Zealand Trusts Act 2019, which will come into force in January.  One of the best reasons to get a will is because if you don’t the rules of “intestacy” kick in when you die and the law dictates who gets what. If a young mother or father dies, for example, they might have some of their money distributed to their own parents, not partner and children. If that parent has remarried, your money could then pass to the spouse’s children.  Vale saw a relative left struggling to make ends meet after a spouse died without a will, meaning his money didn’t automatically pass to her. “She should have been fine after her husband died. (Instead) she was left on the bones of her bum having to borrow money.”  It’s not just money. Talivai has seen a case where the father’s beloved guitar was fought over. In another one a daughter wanted her mother’s special quilt, which wasn’t noted in the will. It could easily have been disposed of.  The good news is that wills can cost as little as $100 and be completed online through Footprint, Public Trust, or other services. They usually have legal support so that someone with an eye for what can go wrong reviews your will, and escalates it if there is an issue.  Footprint, which works with Perpetual Guardian, offers both one-off wills, and also a service where you pay an annual fee, but includes up to $10,000 of estate administration when you die.  Life does take twists and turns, says Tweed, so do remember to update your will when your situation changes. That might be having children, hooking up with a new partner, buying a house or taking out life insurance.  Do have a conversation with your family/beneficiaries. If you don’t plan to share your money equally, let your loved ones know, so there is less chance of a bunfight when you’re gone. Make sure you explain the rationale and keep records of your communication.","Do you have a will? It takes less time for most people than watching an episode of your favourite series on Netflix.

But if you don't really need the money, avoiding an RMD in 2020 or returning an RMD to your retirement account will give the funds more time to grow on a tax-deferred basis before the RMDs are once again required in 2021.  Another CARES Act provision allows for the 10% early withdrawal penalty to be waived for withdrawals up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k)s, for individuals who qualify for COVID-19 relief. Qualifying individuals include those who are diagnosed with COVID-19, have a spouse or dependent who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or experience adverse financial consequences as a result of COVID-19, including quarantines, layoffs, business closures or child care responsibilities. Income tax on the distribution would still be owed but could be paid over a three-year period. Employer plan participants also may increase the amount that can be taken as a loan from a qualified retirement plan from $50,000 to $100,000 for 2020. While the CARES Act allows these penalty-free withdrawals and increased plan loan amounts, you will need to contact your plan administrator to determine whether these options are available in your plan.  Even though you may be able to access these funds penalty-free, it doesn't necessarily mean you should do so. Try to exhaust some of the other provisions in the CARES Act first, such as the mortgage or student loan relief, or using the direct payment to bridge the gap on current expenses before taking a distribution or loan from your retirement account. If you decide to take a withdrawal or loan, work with your financial advisor to consider developing strategies to contribute/pay back these funds over time to reduce any long-term impact to your retirement goals.  Please consult with your tax professional before making any CARES Act-related moves with your retirement accounts. Partnering with your tax and financial professionals can help in the decision-making process. In the meantime, stay safe, stay healthy and keep looking forward to brighter days ahead.

Qualifying individuals include those who are diagnosed with COVID-19, have a spouse or dependent who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or experience adverse financial consequences as a result of COVID-19, including quarantines, layoffs, business closures or child care responsibilities. Income tax on the distribution would still be owed but could be paid over a three-year period. Employer plan participants also may increase the amount that can be taken as a loan from a qualified retirement plan from $50,000 to $100,000 for 2020. While the CARES Act allows these penalty-free withdrawals and increased plan loan amounts, you will need to contact your plan administrator to determine whether these options are available in your plan.  Even though you may be able to access these funds penalty-free, it doesn't necessarily mean you should do so. Try to exhaust some of the other provisions in the CARES Act first, such as the mortgage or student loan relief, or using the direct payment to bridge the gap on current expenses before taking a distribution or loan from your retirement account. If you decide to take a withdrawal or loan, work with your financial advisor to consider developing strategies to contribute/pay back these funds over time to reduce any long-term impact to your retirement goals.  Please consult with your tax professional before making any CARES Act-related moves with your retirement accounts. Partnering with your tax and financial professionals can help in the decision-making process. In the meantime, stay safe, stay healthy and keep looking forward to brighter days ahead.

Dura Pharmaceuticals Inc., a San Diego drug developer, said its 1998
earnings would fall far below expectations. The announcement came after
the close of New York trading. A consensus among analysts had forecast
earnings of $1.39 a share. But the company said it now expects earnings
to fall by 50 cents a share from that level, and analysts expect that
Dura's stock could fall sharply today in reaction. Cam L. Garner, Dura's
chairman, president and chief executive, said his company lowered its
revenue expectations after losing prescription-drug market share late
last year. Trading in the stock was halted. On the Nasdaq Stock Market
yesterday, Dura closed at $38.125, down 56.25 cents.

This process had been temporarily paused during the Covid pandemic.  Only around 500 people will be invited to move over at first, but the Department for Work and Pensions DWP will increase the numbers of people it processes over the next few months.  Everyone will eventually be moved from the older welfare system to Universal Credit by December 2024.  Anyone who applies for new benefits right now gets Universal Credit automatically.

527,679388,"We asked Branton to highlight some of the most important things immigrants should know about retirement planning and discuss some of the challenges they might face.  What is the main challenge immigrants face when planning for retirement?  Whether U.S. citizen, resident alien or nonresident alien, the biggest challenge is understanding how your immigration status affects your U.S.-based retirement income sources. That includes Social Security benefits and pensions, as well as other retirement accounts, such as individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s. Additionally, your immigration status affects how your income is taxed.  » MORE: Sending money abroad? Use NerdWallet's transfer rates tool to compare costs  Can immigrants contribute to and collect Social Security?  Resident aliens, including permanent residents, can contribute to Social Security while working in the U.S., and are generally eligible to receive Social Security.  Nonresident aliens, meanwhile, can pay into Social Security, but their benefits typically terminate if they leave the U.S. for six months or longer. Returning to the U.S. for at least one month should reactivate the benefits.  What are some other common retirement challenges immigrants might face?  There are a handful of issues immigrants planning to retire in the U.S. might run into. Estate planning is more complicated, due to the differences between how property is handled at death for domestic assets and foreign-owned assets.  Compliance reporting is another tricky area, as all foreign-owned accounts exceeding a certain dollar amount must be reported for tax purposes for both U.S. citizens and residents. What's more, U.S. citizens and residents must report worldwide income, though foreign-earned exclusions and tax credits apply.  Transferring retirement accounts into (or out of) the U.S. is a very complicated process, and may not even be advisable. With a few exceptions, you would be required to essentially liquidate your U.S. retirement account and pay taxes as well as any applicable penalties before being able to transfer the funds to an account in another country. Normally, most retirees prefer to stretch out distributions from their retirement accounts.  Because the same might apply for incoming retirement assets, it may be better to keep retirement accounts in the source country while familiarizing yourself with the rules and tax-related issues for withdrawing that money during retirement.  To make the process easier on yourself, consider working with a knowledgeable cross-border financial planner. He or she should have a firm grasp of both the legal and tax differences between your home country and the U.S., which can take some of the burden off of your shoulders as you prepare for retirement.

Today, I'm particularly keen to showcase the progress we are making to strengthen our bank and to make a new Credit Suisse, one that we believe will be more resilient and unparalleled in serving clients around the world. First, David will show you how we are elevating our risk culture and our risk capabilities. Rafael will explain how we are making changes to help keep the bank safe through the effective and efficient compliance organization. And Joanne will detail how we are engineering an exciting digital future. This will be the foundation that should allow us to sustainably grow our core businesses and to invest for the future, particularly in our world-class wealth management franchise, which Francesco will discuss with you at the end of this session.  In November of last year, we unveiled a strategic plan that we believe will help Credit Suisse retain its unique position in global finance. Our promise was to strengthen and simplify the bank so that we could invest for future growth. As you will see today, we are underway in fulfilling that ambition despite facing numerous headwinds including a very difficult macroeconomic environment and geopolitical environment and markets that are less than favorable to our business mix. The fact that we have achieved so much already is a testament to our employees who, despite the challenging environment, relentlessly serve our clients with purpose and integrity around the world. Their efforts are earning the trust of our clients and restoring the faith of key stakeholders, all of which is central to the Credit Suisse turnaround story.  Now let me quickly highlight some of the achievements we have made. At the start of the year, we simplified our operating model by launching our global Wealth Management organization and our Investment Bank division as well as our unified technology and operations function. We strengthened the focus on our Wealth Management businesses by releasing since the end of 2020, $2.5 billion of allocated capital from the Investment Bank. This represents 82% of our ambition of releasing $3 billion by the end of 2022, and we reshaped our Investment Bank by amongst others exiting from the Prime Services business.  We are fully focused on our expense base and are accelerating our cost measures to further reduce the bank's adjusted operating expenses to the lower end of our previously communicated guidance of CHF 16.5 billion to CHF 17 billion in 2023 and 2024, down from around CHF 17 billion expected in 2022. This acceleration includes group-wide measures in technology, operations, procurement, as well as in other areas where our simplification approach will allow us to take excess capacity out of the business. At the same time, we have continued to invest in the future by hiring attracting top talent, including roughly 50 relationship managers in Wealth Management in the first quarter '22 and a similar number of Managing Directors in the Investment Bank since mid-2021.  And we are furthering our commitment to sustainability with roughly CHF 140 billion of sustainable assets under management in the first quarter 2022, up 22% from a year ago, while imposing additional restrictions on Arctic oil and gas, oil sands and deep sea mining. All this information -- sorry, all this transformation is taking place as the global economy and the financial markets are adjusting to geopolitical upheaval, rising inflation and higher interest rates. Credit Suisse has a strong capital base that will allow us to weather these headwinds. In fact, recently highlighted by the Swiss National Bank in its financial stability report.  Our CET1 capital ratio in the first quarter of 2021 was 13.8%, significantly higher compared to the 12.2% a year ago. Our near-term guidance is that we intend to operate with a CET1 ratio of around 13.5%. And our ambition by 2024, remains to be at least at 14% on a pre-Basel III basis. In addition to strengthening our capital position, in recent years, we have shifted significant parts of our capital from the Investment Bank to Wealth Management, the Swiss Bank division and the Asset Management division. In 2015, these three divisions: Wealth Management, Swiss Bank and Asset Management accounted for 0.5x the capital in the Investment Bank. As per the end of the first quarter, they account for 1.5x the capital we have in the Investment Bank. We believe we are, in short, well positioned to handle the changed market conditions.  We have worked extremely hard to improve our risk and control framework. The bank has reduced its group credit portfolio by around 10% as of the end of the first quarter compared to 1 year ago, including a 20% reduction in group market risk RWAs.  As Rafael and David will highlight for you, we have also strengthened our risk and compliance leadership at all levels of the bank. This includes the first and second lines of defense. It includes the bank-wide risk framework and processes, encompassing risk assessment, risk review and risk escalation. Moreover, together with the Board oversight, we have clearly defined accountability as well as roles and responsibilities across the organization. And we have adopted a group-wide initiative, which is based on individual accountability namely, everyone is a risk manager. This cultural change and this cultural change program includes risk training programs as well as adding risk metrics to scorecards and compensation. David will talk more about this in his presentation. We are confident that these and many other initiatives we are undertaking will restore the confidence of our stakeholders in the bank.  Before I hand the mic over to the executives of my team, which will be with me today, let me sum up what our key five priorities are: Firstly, the challenging market environment should not distract us from our determination of executing our strategic plan; secondly, we are continuously working on strengthening our risk culture; thirdly, our employees are fully focused on staying close to our clients and delivering best-in-class solutions; fourthly, our engineers are driving the digital transformation across the bank; and finally, five, we are accelerating our structural cost savings program.  I recognize it has been a difficult 16 months for Credit Suisse stakeholders, but I'm convinced the bank will emerge stronger, more resilient and better equipped to weather adversity and to help our clients in all of their future endeavors.  With every quarter, with every deal, with every Swiss franc of revenue, Credit Suisse will look to stabilize and rebuild. Our intention is to restore the confidence of our stakeholders and deliver financial outcomes that energize our investors. We believe our employees will benefit from this transformation too, holding their heads high, knowing they have helped to shape a premier financial group serving sophisticated clients with care and entrepreneurial spirit.  So without further ado, I would like now to hand over to David. Thank you.  DAVID DANIEL WILDERMUTH, CHIEF RISK OFFICER & MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG: Thank you, Thomas. Welcome, everyone. My name is David Wildermuth. As described, I'm the Group Chief Risk Officer. Just a little bit of my background. So I joined Credit Suisse in January after over 24 years at Goldman Sachs and being a partner for the last 10 years. At Goldman I had a broad career across risk disciplines and from being the Deputy Chief Risk Officer, Chief Credit Officer, the EMEA Chief Risk Officer. And I always had a keen focus on strategic innovation and driving change. And so for example, I led the establishment of the operational risk department, the liquidity risk, enterprise risk, et cetera.  I also have a bit of a technology background, albeit it was a very long time ago. I had a degree in computer science and economics. So I am still very focused on technology adoption and digital transformation. But forgetting about the past and moving to the present, when the opportunity came to join Credit Suisse to lead the risk function, I realize it would be challenging, but I also realize they played to my strengths, both technical and in developing people and culture.  So I have five key messages for today in the context of the title elevating our risk culture and capability. First is that we have these two very important dimensions, and we can't be successful unless we complete both. So the first is what I call the hearts and minds piece. So this is the risk culture, which is inclusive of risk awareness, risk ownership and risk mindset. The second is what I refer to as the muscles and tools piece. So this is the resources, the frameworks, the infrastructure, the capabilities part. And as I said, we cannot succeed unless we do both. One without the other, will just not be sufficient.  So then second, I'm going to provide an important update on the substantial actions that we've taken and the progress that we've made. Third, I'm going to demonstrate that we have concrete plans with a realistic path to achieve our objectives. And then fourth, I'm going to provide some insights into our very sound risk profile and the derisking that we've taken place. And then finally, I want to highlight, this is very important that we remain laser-focused on our BAU risk management in this very challenging market environment.  So as for the title, the last 12 months have been a period of significant and positive change. We've accomplished much, which we'll start covering here. I'm trying to stay out of the way of the slides. But we also fully acknowledge as we cover later in the presentation that we have more to achieve and we need to prove these changes are also sustainable.  So on the left, you're well aware of the firm strategy to strengthen, simplify, invest. And on the right, we have some specific areas of focus that -- on the progress we've made, which we'll deep dive into a bit later. So we based on our risk appetite, reinforcing the risk organization, prioritizing first line of defense ownership, developing a path to demonstrate risk culture and aligning on making the right investments to support our strategic vision.  So on our risk profile, you'll see it's well diversified with a focus on traditional credit risk. So at the left with the breakout of RWA at the end of the first quarter, you'll see credit risk 53% and market risk and counterparty risk are both less than 10%, and counterparty risk is 7%. It is down from 11% in the first quarter of 2021. And at the right, we have a breakout by segment of our credit exposure, which I'm going to cover in more detail on the next page.  So the credit portfolio is diversified and sound. You'll see that the four quadrants are relatively equal in size. Starting at the bottom left, in central banks which is 26% of our portfolio. It doesn't get much better than this. You'll see 99% of the exposures with the Swiss National Bank, ECB and the Federal Reserve to manage our group liquidity. So then if you move up to the top left financial institutions, this is probably somewhat in line with your expectations. It's 87% investment grade. This is commercial banks, funds, asset managers, et cetera. If you move to the top right, that's our commercial segment. So 85% of that's exposure to developed markets. This is also where we include our leveraged finance exposure, which I'll touch upon a little bit later. And then finally, on the bottom right, our very strong consumer business. So this is a very granular and diversified portfolio with 71% being residential mortgages and primarily in Switzerland.  So over a long period of time, the banks actually demonstrated a very strong track record in managing credit risk as the chart shows. We have a significantly lower PCL ratio over this extended period relative to peers. While not included in here, we've also performed very well during the financial crisis, for those of you that remember that. And as I highlighted in the top right, our Swiss Bank and our Wealth Management ratios have each individually averaged 8 basis points over the last 4-year period.  Now Archegos though was a very different catastrophic outcome. So we're in no way diminishing the severity of that. And we've learned many lessons, which we're going to cover in detail later in the presentation. But one clear message to me is that we believe we are best equipped to manage risk in the businesses that we know best. And so that's why our bank strategy is to focus our growth in business activities in the areas we have the deepest expertise across the first line and the second line.  In terms of our aggregate risk profile, we've taken immediate and urgent action to perform a detailed review of our risk portfolio and rebase our risk appetite. Also, importantly, to create capacity to support our growth strategy primarily in Wealth Management and the Swiss Bank. So on the left side, you'll see comparing the first quarter '21 to first quarter '22. Our overall RWAs declined during the period, but actually the direction of travel is consistent with our strategy. So you see the investment bank went down from 39% to 34% while we had an increase in the Swiss Bank, and we had an increase in the Wealth Management segment.  On the right side, we have some specific points. So we reduced the total RWAs by CHF 30 billion. Leverage exposure by CHF 90 billion as part of this recalibration. And these reductions were managed in line with the business strategies, primarily in the IB with the exit of Prime, the non-core GTS markets and optimization of the corporate bank exposure. You also see I've included that our Level 3 assets have declined to CHF 10 billion, which is CHF 1.4 billion of our total assets from CHF 15 billion, and these are all relative to the first quarter of the prior year. And finally, we manage our liquidity on a conservative basis with strong LCR and NSFR metrics.  So as we detailed in the first quarter results, our derisking from both a financial and a client risk perspective, of course, had short-term revenue implications as each reduced or exit client had generated revenues. But executing our strategy and our target focus areas will utilize that capacity, but it will just take some time given the broader market and other conditions.  So I'm going to further deep dive on three areas of risk reduction. So first, we were addressing concentrated positions among our higher-risk clients, we saw this resulted in reducing non-investment grade exposure 17% year-on-year. Secondly, as we'll discuss our exit from the majority of our Prime business with an 83% reduction in RWA. And then finally, we talked about -- we noted 22% reduction in the Ship finance as we look segment by segment and looked at our risk appetite, but important in this area to note that we remain very committed to the sector over time.  So now I'm going to go a little more into looking at it from a slightly different perspective. So first, we have the Swiss Bank business. So you see it's very high quality, 93% investment grade. 73% of that's real estate at quite moderate LTVs. This also is where we include our commodity trade finance sector, where we focus on the mid and large players. And as noted in the bottom, 75% of this exposure is secured and with relatively short-term maturities, less than 180 days. In the middle, we talk about our share-backed lending business. This is core to our strategy of Wealth Management clients, particularly entrepreneurs. 75% of this exposure is investment grade with a diversified portfolio of transactions targeting our ultra-high net worth clients and with a strong presence in APAC. Finally, leverage finance. Obviously, currently a key focus area in the industry given market conditions with widened spreads and higher rates.  We have very strong first and second line capabilities here given our long-term history in the market. You'll see underwriting volumes were down materially in the first quarter. Our first quarter non-investment grade underwriting exposure was quite tightly managed at $4.7 billion. And in terms of current market conditions, it's been challenging in the leveraged finance market, as you know, with price yield impact on both leveraged loans and high-yield bonds.  Our non-investment grade underwriter risk has come down from the first quarter numbers at this point. Also, I think it's important to note that we don't consider hope to be a risk management strategy. And we, in the first line, have been going to market, pricing deals at market clearing levels and getting out of the risk instead of hoping that conditions will improve or change. And finally, while the second quarter is not closed, it's worthy to say, we do expect to take some marks in the quarter on our leveraged finance exposures, which we expect to be proportionate. One interesting note is if you look, we always are participating generally alongside our major peers. And for example, if you look at our three largest non-investment grade exposures at the moment, we are approximately 10% of each of those transactions.  Now I want to focus on our people and investments a little bit more. So investing in our people and our organizational design was clearly one of the key focuses of my first 100-day program. So on the left, we addressed dual-hatting. So six of my direct reports are no longer dual-hatted since April. We've also hired four new direct reports in this period since April 2021. I'd also say here that we remain an attractive employer in the risk area. This actually have created a new metric. We've now had 7 months of net people inflows, net positive people inflows. So for each of the last 7 months, we've hired more people then have left the group. And I think there's a lot of people that share our vision and really embrace what we're doing.  In the middle, we talk about restoring our industry expertise. So our expertise now of my direct reports, is about 25 years of average experience, which is actually above where it was pre-Archegos. And we also have more internal tenure, which I think is important to bring those institutional insights and particularly for me as an outsider, so I can leverage those insights. And then on the right, yes, we've talked about strengthening our risk pillars. So we've reorganized to be more consistent across all risk types. I've also elevated certain risk types such as cyber and tech. Sustainability, as well. And then finally, all of this does take some money, and so we've increased our budget about 15% over 2022 versus the 2020 period.  So climate risk. A lot of my folks stay on risk management progress addressing issues the last year, but I did want to talk about climate risk because it's very important to the bank, and it's actually very important to me personally. So one, our focus on risk is across two dimensions: One, understanding and managing over the emerging climate risks in our businesses; and then secondly, actively supporting the bank's efforts to achieve our sustainability goals. I'm not going to go into a ton of detail here, but specific details on our ongoing climate actions can be found in our TCFD report, which I pictured here on the left. And of course, we're not doing this alone. We're tightly partnering with a number of organizations to align to best practices as climate risk management is an evolving field.  Okay. So Archegos. There are many identified gaps, which we've been addressing through prioritized investments. We had a series of internal and independent assessments that were done and identified root causes. Many have already been addressed through immediate remediation efforts. Others will take some time to address. But we have improvements across both the first line and the second line, enabling greater first line accountability, with stronger second line supervision and challenge. So I'm not going to cover all the detailed points, which you can read, but a couple I'm going to call out.  So in the first line, we've appointed a new investment banking business line CRO, who's building out a strong team. We've completed now the rollout of dynamic margining across our hedge fund portfolio. And we've enhanced our default management capabilities, which already actually prove useful in the Russia-Ukraine crisis management. In the second line side, we've established a new Executive Board Risk Management Committee. We established a new counter-party market risk function as part of our organizational enhancements. We completed a bank-wide review of our largest clients globally. And we've strengthened our limit framework where we're elevating more constraints now to the Executive Board and the Group Board at Directors level. And then finally, we focus a lot on culture, setting the right tone from the top.  I want to touch briefly on Russia, Ukraine, partly because I think it demonstrates that the bank actually does have the capability to act with a great urgency, accountability in time of crisis. And so to take a step back, the best risk management usually happens in advance. And so in this case, and certainly with no credit to (inaudible) not being here, I think we entered the Russia crisis with -- in pretty good position. We had less than CHF 1 billion of exposure even at year-end 2021. And as we were closely monitoring the situation in Russia, before the war broke out, we reduced our exposure in advance of the sanctions.  And then the second place a risk organization can really add value is how we manage through the crisis. And in this case, we mobilized with a real sense of urgency and purpose as the events unfolded. So we implemented multiple times a day, actually four, to be clear, risk reporting on exposure to key developments. We also established across divisional response team, and we had daily meetings, including having executive Board members every day in the room, well virtually that is, to make quick and transparent decisions, which I truly believe resulted in positive outcomes. And so some of the results were the reduction in exposure you see on the left  (technical difficulty)  but it's critical to our success and risk that we're successful in technology and building our risk infrastructure. So most importantly, we've centralized risk under a new CTO, as I mentioned. We actually have a new dedicated Head of Risk Technology who started in May. Our plan includes targeted investment on automation, which is key to reducing our operational risk, enhancing our reporting capabilities. And moving to the cloud will also enable better scaling and efficiency. And as importantly as the things that we're doing are actually that we now have a process around these things. So we've designed a set of principles going forward to guide both further technology investment and the build.  Risk culture. This is one of our key focus areas. Joining me in the front row is Christine Graeff, who's my cosponsor of this from our people division. And so we've developed a risk culture framework. It's set around 10 items. The top 5 are behavioral. The bottom 5 are foundational and centered in our theme that everyone is a risk manager. So immediate changes were made, but we do have more work to do. We launched a culture survey last year to help understand the current state. Key focuses that came out of that were -- emerging from it were to develop a speak-up culture, we have to work to relieve strain, we have to strengthen the risk mindset, and we want to further embed a client focus. It's important that the culture is owned by the Executive Board as a team objective because this does apply to everyone in the bank.  And so some pillars that we've developed, again, set out on the left, just to pick a couple. So encourage challenge. So the behavior there we want to encourage is speaking up and challenging and encouraging others to do so when appropriate and respecting views across the lines of defense. Another one, governance, which has an associated metric is knowing where decision-making and activity takes place and who's accountable. And so for example, one of the sample metrics we shared is the percent of limit breaches resolved within guidelines where we're currently tracking a fraction above 99%. So just showing that we're actually acting again urgently with a sense of accountability when we have limit breaches, they get resolved quickly. Finally, taking ownership, which I think is one of the core principles. So the behavior we want to encourage there is across all lines of defense. So people take responsibility and their risk management seriously, and they hold themselves and others accountable for their decisions.  And so one of the metrics we chose here was the risk deep dives performed by the first line of defense in our risk committees. And so the plus 70% actually relates to the number of events that occurred -- number of times those things occurred in 2021 relative to 2020. So I think this demonstrates our first-line business leaders showing and demonstrating that they own the risk, that they understand the risk. In fact, they quite -- they talk quite vastly about the risk, including the financial and the non-financial risks. And it really sets a strong tone from the top because as we know, people focus on what their bosses are focusing on. And when they see our division head spending time focusing on risk with such a great focus, causes them to focus more on it as well.  We've also established a strategic regulatory remediation function to make sure we can strengthen our delivery on the regulatory commitments. This was launched in April of 2022. I'm leading that effort, although it is not formally part of risk because actually, the regulatory programs, more than half of them are actually not risk-specific programs. They're bank-wide programs as a whole. We have significant oversight from my CEO, Thomas, from our Chairman, Axel and from the Board of Directors. And our key goal is moving towards being more holistic from perhaps being in the past to be reactive. And so we're now looking across all regulators, all commitments and then as importantly, taking into account what is our goal for our capabilities and for our road map and then bringing that all together with a more holistic view and then ensuring that they are actual deliverables that would be able to hit in a timely way. And we're making progress in repositioning our mindset.  Okay. This is my last slide. So we will continue to deliver on this strategy. Our objectives are clear. We need to elevate both the risk culture and our risk capabilities, taking stock to the progress that we've made. We need to execute the clear plans we have in place to address our ongoing initiatives. Recognizing the derisking that we've done, we need to build our sound risk profile to facilitate the strategic growth in our plans. And we need to remain laser-focused on our day-to-day risk management.  So in closing, thank you all very much for your time. I feel confident that we've made substantial progress and impact and that we know what we need to do but we do have more work to do. Some will come sooner as we deliver on our near-term upgrades and the tone from the top. Some will take longer to fully implement such as our more comprehensive uplift of our data and infrastructure. We know we need to prove it, not just say it, and we know that sometimes perception lags reality. But I do know that we're making progress every day, every week, every month and the banks risk management today is much different already in tone, proactively and accountability, and we're going to elevate further from here. So thank you very much. And I will now hand it over to Rafael.  RAFAEL LOPEZ LORENZO, CHIEF COMPLIANCE OFFICER & MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE BOARD, CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG: Thank you, David, and thank you, everyone, and welcome to the deep dive. My name is Rafael Lopez Lorenzo. I've been the Chief Compliance Officer of Credit Suisse since October last year. And prior to that, I was the Global Head of Internal Audit at Credit Suisse as well. Being in the bank for 7 years and prior to that, I spent 12 years at JPMorgan Chase in New York. Also, in internal audit, mostly focusing on the investment bank and also in PricewaterhouseCoopers and IBM consulting in London.  The goal of today's session is to share the vision and the changes we're making in compliance and also give you some perspective of where we are in that journey. I hope that I'll be able to provide you with insights on how this changes are positioned in Credit Suisse to, number one, avoid legacy issues by having a stronger compliance, risk management and controls; number two, gaining efficiencies by the way we're simplifying our processes and tools; number three, improving regulatory relationships, and we're doing that by being more proactive, being more risk-focused and being more transparent about what we're doing on the regulatory book of work; and finally, by strengthening the compliance risk culture and especially we're going to touch today on rebalancing first-line and control functions.  For this presentation, I would like to provide a context and evolution of compliance in banking. It's not going to be very long, but at least it will give you an idea of some of the regulatory changes that the industry has faced and how Credit Suisse has adapted to those. I'd also like to introduce my vision for compliance. This is a really important pillar on everything else we're doing be it internally and also how we face our key stakeholders. Touching on the compliance organization, which is a completely new organization. I will also provide three examples of how we are reinforcing risk management and controls. Share some insights on how we are addressing regulatory commitments and how we go about it. And finally, some of my personal insights in how I see compliance risk culture improving in the bank.  The banking industry. What we have seen is a sustained increase in volume and complexity of compliance requirements. And this has been affecting all banks, as you very well know. I think Swiss banks, in particular, had an extra challenge, especially after we opened up from the banking -- strict banking secrecy requirements, especially around 2008 and 2017. You have some of the events on the screen. But if you look at the events, they tripled and events could be new regulations, position papers and amendments to specific regulations. They triple over the last 10 years. And they focus on a very wide variety of topics, anti-money laundry, data, client protection, crypto, greenwashing and tax compliance amongst all those.

The federal agency awarded $750,000 to one Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program recipient in Oklahoma to link people with HIV who are either newly diagnosed, or are diagnosed but currently not in care, to essential HIV care and treatment and support services, as well as to provide workforce training and technical assistance.  Oklahoma is among seven states identified with a substantial rural HIV burden.  Fees drop for state's college saving plan  Effective this month, the management fee for Oklahoma’s 529 College Savings Plan is being reduced by more than 16%. The new management fee will be 0.25% on account balances, down from 0.3%. The fee reduction could save account owners a combined total of about $500,000 per year.  State Treasurer Randy McDaniel, chair of the plan’s board of trustees, said the fee reduction is only one of many positive changes that are on the way for the plan’s almost 31,000 account owners.  “The state’s 529 plan is already the best option for Oklahoma families to save for educational costs, but we are making it even better,” said McDaniel. “In the coming months, we will be announcing several additional improvements that include enhanced investment options and upgraded online account management.”  The Oklahoma 529 College Savings Plan is the only direct-sold 529 plan with an Oklahoma income tax deduction for contributions of up to $20,000 per year. Contributions made by April 15 of this year can be deducted from 2019 state tax returns.  The plan has more than 57,000 active accounts.  Staff reports"

Do I need to bring my DD-214 to the SSA Office when I apply? My wife has not held a job outside the home, but she has worked as hard if not harder than me running and taking care of our home and affairs when I was away a lot of the time. She turns 66 in September 2022. Can she apply for Social Security and, if so, does she get a percentage of what I get?  Thank you for any help you can give me.  Signed: Retired Military  Dear Retired Military:  There are no ""dumb questions,"" especially when it comes to Social Security which has over 2,700 different rules sure to perplex even the most learned among us. I'll answer your questions in the order you posed them:  Your full retirement age (or ""FRA"") is 66 years and 2 months. Your FRA is when you get 100% of the benefit you've earned from a lifetime of working. Claiming earlier will mean a reduced benefit; waiting longer can mean a larger benefit. If you wish to claim benefits at your full retirement age in December 2021, you should apply for those benefits in September 2021 (SS suggests you apply 3 months before you wish benefits to begin). Just be sure to specify your benefit start month as December to get your full benefit.  You do not need your DD-214 when you apply for Social Security. Your earnings during your military career are already known to Social Security and will, along with any non-military earnings, form the basis for your Social Security benefit. Your SS benefit will be based upon the highest-earning 35-years of your lifetime earnings career (adjusted for inflation). You do not need to go to the SS office to apply; you can apply over the phone (call to make an appointment first) or online at www.ssa.gov/retire. Applying online is by far the easiest way to claim your benefits.  Even though your wife is not eligible for SS benefits on her own work record, she can still collect a spousal benefit from you. If she waits until she reaches her FRA before she claims, she'll get 50% of the benefit you are entitled to at your full retirement age. Your wife's FRA is 66 years and 4 months and, although she can claim the spouse benefit before that, if she does it will be actuarially reduced according to the number of months before her FRA that she claims. FYI, your wife cannot collect her spousal benefit until you have started to collect your benefits.  Finally, thank you for your many years of service to our country. Your pay while serving will be part of the 35 highest-earning years over your lifetime used to compute your Social Security benefit.

(Seven years ago, my sister was 12.)  * 12 open accounts.  * An unblemished payment history.  * Over $100,000 credit line.  * Four hard inquiries in the past year, which is above average, suggesting that her score could rise even further once the impact of those 'hard pulls' dissipates.  »MORE: Understand your credit score  Those stats aren't errors. They just reflect the potential power of 'authorized user' status.  My parents didn't have a master plan when they added Megan as an authorized user of their cards. They did so simply because giving her direct access to their cards was easier than giving her cash when she went on school trips, attended dance camps, or just stepped out for gas or groceries.  Fortunately for Megan, my parents have had many years of impeccable credit hygiene, and she automatically gained that same benefit as an authorized user of their cards. As a result, my sister has amazing credit, even though the longest-serving card she herself owns is just 1 year and 5 months old.  'The first time I found out my credit score was when I applied for an apartment and they requested my credit information,' Megan told me. 'I remember sitting at the desk in my dorm room, and once I found out, I immediately called my mom and then I ran around and told all of my roommates. Sadly they didn't share the excitement since they had no idea what a credit score was.'  Should you do this for your children?  This may sound odd, but you can add your children of any age as authorized users on your credit cards. Here are the caveats you should keep in mind:  * The authorized user approach makes sense only if you can add your children to a card in good standing, meaning you're paying the bills on time and keeping the balance low. Any mistakes you make on your card, such as missing a bill or charging a high percentage of your credit limit, would damage your children's credit score.  * If you're concerned about what your children might do with access to your credit line, then simply don't give them the actual cards. Add your children as authorized users and then "" when the mail comes "" shred the cards or bury them in your sock drawer. Your children will get the credit benefit regardless of whether their card is ever used; the credit bureaus don't know the difference.  * FICO and VantageScore, the two biggest credit scoring companies in the U.S., aren't enamored of the idea of credit piggybacking. They're working on newer versions of their credit-scoring algorithms to lessen the positive impact of being an authorized user, so your children may not benefit as much as my sister did. That said, lenders tend to be rather slow to adopt the newer credit scoring algorithms, so this may not have much real-world impact for a while.  * If you trust your children with access to your money, you'll also need to trust that they'll protect your credit card information. Make sure they know credit card security basics, like to use it only at reputable websites and businesses, and to never leave cards lying around in public sight.  My mom, Kristen, has some additional advice: 'Make sure your child understands the importance of credit and that it isn't free money. They can go and buy something on credit and it be pretty easy, but they have to understand that the charge has to be paid.'

(dave.sebastian@wsj.com ; @depsebastian)  (DJ Bolsa)-- As yields dos Treasurys a 10 anos descem para 0,72% face a 0,73% num momento em que os investidores apostam que os novos estímulos orçamentais só surgirão após as eleições. A esperada injeção de fundos deve impulsionar a recuperação económica da recessão causada pela pandemia, o que por sua vez deve resultar numa venda de Treasurys, elevando as yields. Mas com o impasse político a adiar um novo plano, os receios acerca da contestação dos resultados eleitorais e os revezes no desenvolvimento de uma vacina para o coronavírus provocaram um ambiente de aversão ao risco no mercado.

The concessional contributions you are making would be $21,250 a year each after allowing for the 15 per cent contributions tax.  If your funds earn 7 per cent, your husband's super should be worth about $780,000 when he retires at age 70. If you work to age 65, your super should be worth about $900,000.

We are self-funded, over our preservation ages, but under 60. Due to the pandemic, I started casual work as a contractor three days a week with my original employer. We have also moved closer to my ageing parents and sold our house. We are now looking at buying a new, more expensive property.

Would the lump-sum withdrawal meet Australian Taxation Office rules, considering my casual work?  Based on the information provided, there may be an amount that could be withdrawn.  Your first task is to obtain the latest statement from your super fund that contains the accumulation balance to see if there is any amount unpreserved from the old rules. This is unlikely and you would probably find that all your funds became unpreserved when you retired.  However, your fund may require you to satisfy them that you did actually retire if you did not notify them at the time.  Any contributions and earnings after you recommenced work would, in your case, be preserved until you satisfy a condition of release. Until you turn 60, you have to retire to access those amounts.

My wife and I are in our mid-50s and have about $500 a week each for investing. Neither of us has much super - we are both reluctant to pour money into it. Where could we invest our cash that would give us the best return over the next 10 years? Potential options include super, an investment property, a property trust, managed funds or blue-chip shares. Anything else?  There are two important factors to consider - the types of investments to hold and the best entities in which to hold them.  For a person in their mid-50s earning more than $37,000 a year, the perfect investment is super because you can usually invest in pre-tax dollars with salary sacrifice.  Because salary-sacrificed contributions lose just 15 per cent in tax and money taken in hand loses at least 39 per cent, you are making big tax savings immediately.  Once the money is inside super, you and your financial adviser can decide what sort of asset mix is appropriate for you. The cream on the cake is that fund earnings are taxed at just 15 per cent a year while you are working - and then zero tax once you retire and start a pension from the fund.  I am aged 65 and will be applying for my UK and Australian aged pensions on my next birthday in May. I left the UK at the age of 35 and have been advised I should receive £80 per week from a part-state pension. In addition, I receive a monthly pension of £438 for life from my former UK employer. I have only $200,000 in Australian super. Would I be required to pay Australian tax on my UK pensions?

537,632991," CARES was established by Vera, to assist homeowners in various stages of default.  ``Most homeowners experience such overpowering and demoralizing emotions that in effect, they become paralyzed,'' Vera said.    Default and foreclosure statistics demonstrate CARES is on the cutting edge of an unfortunate, but realistic emerging trend in the state's homeowner status.    As examples, San Diego County had 11,912 notices of default for 1992, a 40 percent increase over 1990, when 8,005 notices of default were filed.  Sacramento County foreclosures went from $203 million in 1990 to a projected record-breaking jump of $1.1 billion for 1993.    Another critically affected area is Southern California's Inland Empire, comprising Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where there were 2,000 foreclosures per month in 1992 and are expected to reach 3,600 per month by the middle of this year.    Vera summarized some of the causes for this growing phenomenon. ``The tremendous loss in aerospace, finance, construction, retail and manufacturing industries; the North American Free Trade Act; military cutbacks; federal budget cuts; a difficult business environment and the fact that more people are leaving California, than are coming in, are just a few reasons for this trend,'' he said.    The financial status of the nation's lending institutions and Americans' inability to save were two more examples Vera cited as reasons for the default and foreclosure problems of the state's homeowners.  ``The fact that Americans have insignificant savings, are earning less, and are more in debt; not to mention the mismanagement of our banks and savings and loans,'' Vera added.    To combat this growing concern, CARES conducts educational seminars, known as The California Foreclosure Forum for real estate agents and free property owner seminars, called The California Foreclosure Prevention Forum.    ``Even though our banks are allowed creative accounting procedures, it is acknowledged that repossessing hundreds of homes could be devastating to the lending institution, if not a direct cause for their failure.  We have to understand that banks really do not want our homes.  The logical approach is to find alternate repayment structures for the homeowner,'' Vera stated.    The homeowner's seminar, The California Foreclosure Prevention Forum, educates property owners as to the alternatives, such as ``forbearance.''  This method allows homeowners to keep their homes by working out modified payment plans.    ``Unfortunately, in economically distressed times, many miracle cures are offered and are designed to take advantage of the desperate homeowner.  Our seminar attendees are shown how hard money loans work and what potential problems to look for from lenders offering such loans,'' he added.    Vera has nearly 20 years of experience in negotiating with lenders, trustees and attorneys, as well as local, state, and federal agencies and governments, through all phases of the process, which may or may not include the sale of property.    ``If the property owner has decided the best answer is to sell, he may try to do it himself.  Being a `FSBO' (For Sale By Owner) is risky business, even in good times.  Today's buyers are looking for bargains, the seller is stressed and escrows can be complicated.    ``The homeowner may decide to list the property with a professional real estate agent ... but who?  You know the foreclosure clock is ticking, you told your realtor, but unless he had special training and is knowledgeable in the foreclosure process, chances are the property owner's problem won't be solved in time, if foreclosure is to be avoided,'' Vera stated.    In addition to the free homeowner seminars, CARES also conducts a four-hour course for real estate brokers and agents throughout California.  This educational program provides agents the tools to assist their clients in those unfamiliar and critical circumstances.    During the agent seminars, the three most commonly used bankruptcy chapters are discussed as options.  Bankruptcy is a valid strategy that can help rehabilitate a property owner.  Vera said bankruptcy requirements and the long-term effects are included in the seminar presentation.    ``Here, competent legal assistance is very strongly encouraged,'' he said.  ``Bankruptcy mills are defined and their use is urgently discouraged,'' he commented.    Those who attend either the California Foreclosure Forum or the California Foreclosure Prevention Forum are shocked when they hear about little-known capital gains tax consequences of a foreclosure.    ``Generally speaking, even though the home is lost through foreclosure, the borrower still has a tax liability on an amount equal to the sum of all the loans against the property, delinquencies, late fees, attorneys fees, foreclosure trustee fees, less the cost basis of the original home whose gain was rolled over into the current property,'' Vera pointed out.    He summed up the homeowner seminar by indicating the solution is knowledge and action.  ``The homeowner must exhaust all his options toward his intent, to save or to sell,'' he said.

538,1490089,"WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters Life!) - Buying or selling a home might be the biggest single financial transaction of your life. You want to get it right but how do you do that at a time when even professionals don't fully understand what's going on in the housing market?  Is it a good time to buy a home or sell a home? Here are some thoughts about how to approach the housing market now.  -- Don't rush. Probably the one housing market observation that everyone agrees on is this: It's not going to take off in a hurry. Analysts expect it to be several years before home prices return to the levels they reached in 2005-2007. And they don't expect mortgage rates to skyrocket, either.  -- Research your own market. Some areas still seem to be in free fall, with high foreclosures and no real recovery in sight. Other areas that weren't so bubbly in the first place have been doing all right. Check with local real estate agents and Websites like trulia.com, (http://www.trulia.com) homegain.com (http://www.homegain.com) or the Standard & Poor's Case Shiller index (http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-case-shiller-home-price-indices/en/us/?indexId=SPUSA-CASHPIDFF--P-US----) to see what's actually happening in your chosen neighborhood.  -- Expect prices to fall further. There's a disconnect between what sellers think their homes are worth and what buyers are willing to pay, according to a new survey from HomeGain. Some 79 percent of homeowners believe their homes are worth more than the recommended agent listing price, and 69 percent of agents and brokers think homes are overpriced. If owners really want to sell their home, they'll drop the price to a level that will attract offers; it's rarely worth carrying a home for months or years while you wait for the price to get to your desired level. That means that homebuyers may find some better deals ahead.  -- Look for a retirement or vacation home now. If you've been thinking you'd like a second home now or a future home in the traditional retirement Sunbelt, go shopping. You'll be able to get a good deal. But beware: You may lack neighbors for years to come. That doesn't just mean you'll be lonely; it means you could be paying out-sized condo and clubhouse fees to compensate.  -- Plan a seasonal approach. If you need to sell now, price your house low enough to engage a buyer before snow falls. In cold-weather areas, winter is often a long and lackluster time for real estate. If you're buying, start looking now, but expect that by winter you may get even more for your money.  -- Keep it about your own budget. If you want to buy a home and can afford the payments, don't worry so much about the macro-economic forecast for housing.  -- Keep maintenance in mind. The recession has dampened the market for contractors and for energy commodities. Once the economic recovery strengthens, you can expect to pay a lot more for any repair work your home requires, and for your heating and cooling bills going forward. Look for the lot and the house that will fit your family, but keep an eye on those practical considerations, too.  (Editing by Gunna Dickson and Patricia Reaney)","(Linda Stern is a freelance writer.

Analysts expect it to be several years before home prices return to the levels they reached in 2005-2007. And they don't expect mortgage rates to skyrocket, either.  -- Research your own market. Some areas still seem to be in free fall, with high foreclosures and no real recovery in sight. Other areas that weren't so bubbly in the first place have been doing all right. Check with local real estate agents and Websites like trulia.com, (http://www.trulia.com) homegain.com (http://www.homegain.com) or the Standard & Poor's Case Shiller index (http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-case-shiller-home-price-indices/en/us/?indexId=SPUSA-CASHPIDFF--P-US----) to see what's actually happening in your chosen neighborhood.  -- Expect prices to fall further. There's a disconnect between what sellers think their homes are worth and what buyers are willing to pay, according to a new survey from HomeGain. Some 79 percent of homeowners believe their homes are worth more than the recommended agent listing price, and 69 percent of agents and brokers think homes are overpriced. If owners really want to sell their home, they'll drop the price to a level that will attract offers; it's rarely worth carrying a home for months or years while you wait for the price to get to your desired level. That means that homebuyers may find some better deals ahead.  -- Look for a retirement or vacation home now. If you've been thinking you'd like a second home now or a future home in the traditional retirement Sunbelt, go shopping. You'll be able to get a good deal. But beware: You may lack neighbors for years to come. That doesn't just mean you'll be lonely; it means you could be paying out-sized condo and clubhouse fees to compensate.  -- Plan a seasonal approach. If you need to sell now, price your house low enough to engage a buyer before snow falls. In cold-weather areas, winter is often a long and lackluster time for real estate. If you're buying, start looking now, but expect that by winter you may get even more for your money.  -- Keep it about your own budget. If you want to buy a home and can afford the payments, don't worry so much about the macro-economic forecast for housing.  -- Keep maintenance in mind. The recession has dampened the market for contractors and for energy commodities. Once the economic recovery strengthens, you can expect to pay a lot more for any repair work your home requires, and for your heating and cooling bills going forward. Look for the lot and the house that will fit your family, but keep an eye on those practical considerations, too.  (Editing by Gunna Dickson and Patricia Reaney)"

He wanted to travel, and we did. He paid for all our first-class travel and very expensive cruises, safaris and tours. I paid mostly for hotels and incidentals. We talked about this arrangement, and I was very clear that I didn’t have the funds to travel the way he intended. He said money was not an issue.  I also told him before I moved in that, by quitting my job and giving up my home, I would be priced out of the real-estate market where I lived. He said that I could stay in his home for as long as I wanted, and he would advise his executor of this arrangement. I spent money decorating his homes and providing a loving environment for him.  This year, after returning from a safari in Africa, he told me we were over without any explanation or discussion. He owns homes in California and Texas, and we were in Texas at the time. He said that I could stay in the California house for four months until he returned there. When I met him I had a part-time job and my own home. I gave up both to create a life with him.  The cost of living is very high where I live. I could not afford my own place on my retirement income, and I had to get another job. That’s not easy at 72. Anyway, I did get a job and I did get a place to live, but I’m left wondering what I am owed.

541,333705,"Obama embarked on Tuesday on a tour through college campuses in North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa to discuss the rate increase. Before he left, however, Romney stole a little wind from his sails by saying he, too, agreed with the need to stop the rate from doubling.  Some questions and answers about student loan debt and the scheduled interest rate hike:  Q: How big of a problem is student loan debt?  A: U.S. student loan debt has surpassed credit card and auto-loan debt, with some estimates putting it at $1 trillion. This debt jeopardizes the fragile recovery and increases the burden on taxpayers. About two-thirds of student loan debt is held by people under 30, according to the New York Fed. Borrowers owe a median $12,800, an amount even advocates for student borrowers acknowledge is usually manageable and more than worthwhile factoring in the economic benefits of a college degree. However, not all borrowers complete a degree -- and the average balance is considerably higher than the median: about $23,000. That reflects a relatively small number of borrowers with very large balances.  Q: Are there signs of improvement?  A: Unlike other forms of consumer debt, student loan debt is growing. The most recent figures show new college graduates with loans owed more than $25,000 when they left school, up 5 percent from the year before. Mark Kantrowitz of the website Finaid.org estimates that 85 percent of student loan debt is owed to the federal government, and those loans typically carry lower rates and borrower protections such as income-based repayment maximums.  However, the number of borrowers defaulting on federal loans has jumped sharply recently. Of 3.6 million borrowers who entered repayment in fiscal 2009, nearly 9 percent defaulted with two years, up from 7 percent for the previous year's cohort. Meanwhile, the College Board said last fall that the average in-state tuition and fees at four-year public colleges rose an additional $631, or about 8 percent, compared with a year ago. The cost of a full credit load has passed $8,000 -- an all-time high.  Q: Why is the interest rate on subsidized Stafford loans expected to double?  A: Acting on a Democratic campaign promise in 2006, Democrats in 2007 crafted the law to progressively lower the interest rate from 6.8 percent to the 3.4 percent rate -- where it is this school year -- and then return to the original 6.8 percent in 2012. Republican President George W. Bush signed the deal into law after it was approved by bipartisan but Democratic-heavy majorities in both chambers. Congress wrote the law this way for one simple reason, says Jason Delisle, director of the federal education budget project at the New America Foundation: cost. It would cost an additional $6 billion annually to keep the interest rate at 3.4 percent.  Q: Are there people who aren't affected by the rate increase?  A: Students issued loans before July 1 won't be hit with the higher rate. It also doesn't affect the interest rates on unsubsidized Stafford loans (now at 6.8 percent) and PLUS loans for parents (now at 7.9 percent). Unlike subsidized Stafford loans, unsubsidized Stafford loans are not based on financial need.  Q: What is the reaction from Congress?  A: Rep. John Kline, R-Minn., chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, has said he and his Republican colleagues are exploring options ""in hopes of finding a responsible solution that serves borrowers and taxpayers equally well."" He said lofty campaign promises put them in an ""untenable situation"" and they now must choose between allowing interest rates to rise or ""piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers."" In the Senate, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said this week he intends to introduce legislation that would extend the interest rate for another year.

542,340892,"You could pay the taxes  If you own an investment property, you could sell it, take the cash and later purchase your new residence, but you will pay taxes. You will most likely end up paying capital gains tax, depreciation recapture, and possibly the 3.8% investment tax.  You could move in  If your investment property is a single-family house, you could move in and change the utilities into your name, using the property address for all your mail.  The converted property would no longer be reported on your 1040 Schedule E (or through a K-1 for a pass-through entity) but your Schedule A. Your Schedule A is where you report your property tax and mortgage interest deductions.  Your mortgage lender may have issues if you are changing the property's use or the title from an entity to your name. Likewise, the county tax assessor will scrutinize the title transfer.  If the title is in an entity and it is changed to individuals, those individuals need to be the same owners of the entity. If they are not the same, you may have transfer tax to pay.  You could perform a 1031 exchange  If you own a small commercial strip center, for example, you could perform a 1031 tax-deferred exchange into a single-family house you rent to a tenant.  To satisfy the requirements of a 1031 tax-deferred exchange, the replacement property must be used for investment purposes to qualify as a ""like-kind"" exchange. ""Like-kind"" is more about the tax status (investment or personal) rather than the type of property.  Your initial intent of the exchange needs to be for investment purposes. You intend to rent the house at market value to a third party. There is no precise time to rent the property, but my understanding is that a two-year minimum is safe.  You could commit fraud  You are exchanging an investment property for your dream home; moving into it shortly after constitutes fraud. Or, keeping the house vacant for 18 months, never attempting to market for rent, securing a tenant, or showing income will undoubtedly be a red flag with the tax authorities.  You should have documentation of your intention to rent the house, including emails to your accountant and intermediary. Having a lease and showing investment income will solidify your intentions.  Having emails to your broker, accountant, or intermediary telling of your intentions to move in the day after closing will undoubtedly solidify your intentions as well. However, it is legal to choose later to update your intentions and move into the house, but be sure you document a legitimate reason.  You may save taxes by strategically moving into a rental house you own or exchanging into your dream home; be sure you follow the guidelines and timing in doing so.  Remember that if you had a prior exchange, you could end up paying taxes from that event when you or your estate sells the replacement house.  Burt M.

Over the years, many clients have asked me if they can convert an investment property or a rental house into their personal residence. The answer is yes, if you follow the guidelines.

Let me start by stating that I am not a tax adviser but a real estate broker. Please do not take this information as advice and buy your dream home. Talk to your tax accountant and a 1031 tax-deferred exchange intermediary who can guide you through a transaction and inform you of the tax consequences.
You could pay the taxes  If you own an investment property, you could sell it, take the cash and later purchase your new residence, but you will pay taxes. You will most likely end up paying capital gains tax, depreciation recapture, and possibly the 3.8% investment tax.  You could move in  If your investment property is a single-family house, you could move in and change the utilities into your name, using the property address for all your mail.  The converted property would no longer be reported on your 1040 Schedule E (or through a K-1 for a pass-through entity) but your Schedule A. Your Schedule A is where you report your property tax and mortgage interest deductions.  Your mortgage lender may have issues if you are changing the property's use or the title from an entity to your name. Likewise, the county tax assessor will scrutinize the title transfer.  If the title is in an entity and it is changed to individuals, those individuals need to be the same owners of the entity. If they are not the same, you may have transfer tax to pay.  You could perform a 1031 exchange  If you own a small commercial strip center, for example, you could perform a 1031 tax-deferred exchange into a single-family house you rent to a tenant.  To satisfy the requirements of a 1031 tax-deferred exchange, the replacement property must be used for investment purposes to qualify as a ""like-kind"" exchange. ""Like-kind"" is more about the tax status (investment or personal) rather than the type of property.  Your initial intent of the exchange needs to be for investment purposes. You intend to rent the house at market value to a third party. There is no precise time to rent the property, but my understanding is that a two-year minimum is safe.  You could commit fraud  You are exchanging an investment property for your dream home; moving into it shortly after constitutes fraud. Or, keeping the house vacant for 18 months, never attempting to market for rent, securing a tenant, or showing income will undoubtedly be a red flag with the tax authorities.  You should have documentation of your intention to rent the house, including emails to your accountant and intermediary. Having a lease and showing investment income will solidify your intentions.  Having emails to your broker, accountant, or intermediary telling of your intentions to move in the day after closing will undoubtedly solidify your intentions as well. However, it is legal to choose later to update your intentions and move into the house, but be sure you document a legitimate reason.  You may save taxes by strategically moving into a rental house you own or exchanging into your dream home; be sure you follow the guidelines and timing in doing so.  Remember that if you had a prior exchange, you could end up paying taxes from that event when you or your estate sells the replacement house.  Burt M.

548,1396193,"The APR is the total charge for credit calculated annually and stated as a percentage. It includes not only the interest rate you will be paying but also onetime closing charges, such as discount points, that increase the overall cost of your loan. (A point is 1 percent of the loan amount.)     Although it is smarter to make a borrowing decision based on total cost than on the contract rate alone, the APR calculation leaves a lot to be desired.     For one thing, finding out the APR after you apply (rather than before) doesn't leave a lot of room for comparison shopping. But beyond that, the APR assumes you will keep the loan for the full term, say, 15 or 30 years, when in reality, most people sell or refinance within six to 12 years.     Since the effective interest rate of your mortgage depends on how long you keep the loan, the APR doesn't portray your true costs. And the sooner you pay off your mortgage, the higher the APR. Why? Because the cost of points is spread over a shorter period.     Take a 30-year, $200,000 mortgage at 7 percent interest plus two points. If you hold it for the full term, the APR would be 7.2 percent. But if you sold the house after just six years and paid off the loan, the effective interest rate would be 7.33 percent.     But theorizing that the loan won't be paid early isn't the only ""bad"" assumption with the APR calculation, says Barry Habib of the Mortgage Market Guide, a Holmdel, N.J.-based service that helps loan originators improve their production. It also:     * Fails to calculate for inflation. The formula does not consider what the value of the dollar will be five or 10 years from now, says Habib.     * Does not consider the value of the money for fees and other loan charges if they weren't spent on those costs.     * Neglects the tax consequences. ""This can be significant,"" the sales trainer says, ""because higher fees on the mortgage may not be deductible, while the interest paid on a higher interest rate usually are.""     David Ginsburg of Loantech, a Gaithersburg, Md., mortgage audit software company, says ""the APR is useless.""     ""If you were on an island and had only one choice, I'd say, 'Yes, go ahead and use it.' "" Ginsburg says. ""But otherwise, it's like stabbing in the dark. I've seen plenty of cases where the loan with the lower APR costs more money, so I'd rather throw a dart at a dartboard.""     The better way to compare loan costs is to calculate the effective interest rates of the various choices. You'll need a financial calculator to come up with precise numbers, but you can use this formula from The Mortgage Kit by Thomas Steinmetz, a step-by-step workbook ($19.95) on how to determine the best deal:     EIR equals the quoted rate plus the number of points divided by the number of years you expect to keep the loan.     So, looking at the $200,000 loan above, suppose your time frame was six years and you had a choice between two 30-year mortgages, one at 7 percent and two points and the other at 7.25 percent and one point. Using the EIR formula, the true rate on the 7 percent loan with more points is 7.33 percent, while the actual rate on the 7.25 percent loan with fewer points is 7.42 percent.     But the best way to compare loans is to calculate their after-tax cost in dollars rather than as an effective interest rate.     ""The ATC is the best measure because it takes into account not only the interest rate, points and number of years you will stay with the loans but also your tax deductions,"" says Ginsburg of Loantech.     There is no easy formula to determine the ATC, but Loantech has developed a product that can help. Its ""Rates and Fees"" computerized service contains the ATC for more than 500 possible rate-and-point combinations. The cost of the five-page report, which is based on your loan amount, loan term and marginal tax bracket, is $39.     ""You can save more than $2,000 by picking the best combination of rates and points,"" Ginsburg says.     To learn more, go to loantech .com or call 1-800-888-6781.   ","WASHINGTON -- When it comes to comparing the true cost of one mortgage to another, there are three ways to go: bad, better and best.

The worst method -- and also the laziest -- is to go by the annual percentage rate, that calculation lenders are required by law to provide borrowers within three days after applying for a loan. You'll also see it in advertisements.   
The APR is the total charge for credit calculated annually and stated as a percentage. It includes not only the interest rate you will be paying but also onetime closing charges, such as discount points, that increase the overall cost of your loan. (A point is 1 percent of the loan amount.)     Although it is smarter to make a borrowing decision based on total cost than on the contract rate alone, the APR calculation leaves a lot to be desired.     For one thing, finding out the APR after you apply (rather than before) doesn't leave a lot of room for comparison shopping. But beyond that, the APR assumes you will keep the loan for the full term, say, 15 or 30 years, when in reality, most people sell or refinance within six to 12 years.     Since the effective interest rate of your mortgage depends on how long you keep the loan, the APR doesn't portray your true costs. And the sooner you pay off your mortgage, the higher the APR. Why? Because the cost of points is spread over a shorter period.     Take a 30-year, $200,000 mortgage at 7 percent interest plus two points. If you hold it for the full term, the APR would be 7.2 percent. But if you sold the house after just six years and paid off the loan, the effective interest rate would be 7.33 percent.     But theorizing that the loan won't be paid early isn't the only ""bad"" assumption with the APR calculation, says Barry Habib of the Mortgage Market Guide, a Holmdel, N.J.-based service that helps loan originators improve their production. It also:     * Fails to calculate for inflation. The formula does not consider what the value of the dollar will be five or 10 years from now, says Habib.     * Does not consider the value of the money for fees and other loan charges if they weren't spent on those costs.     * Neglects the tax consequences. ""This can be significant,"" the sales trainer says, ""because higher fees on the mortgage may not be deductible, while the interest paid on a higher interest rate usually are.""     David Ginsburg of Loantech, a Gaithersburg, Md., mortgage audit software company, says ""the APR is useless.""     ""If you were on an island and had only one choice, I'd say, 'Yes, go ahead and use it.' "" Ginsburg says. ""But otherwise, it's like stabbing in the dark. I've seen plenty of cases where the loan with the lower APR costs more money, so I'd rather throw a dart at a dartboard.""     The better way to compare loan costs is to calculate the effective interest rates of the various choices. You'll need a financial calculator to come up with precise numbers, but you can use this formula from The Mortgage Kit by Thomas Steinmetz, a step-by-step workbook ($19.95) on how to determine the best deal:     EIR equals the quoted rate plus the number of points divided by the number of years you expect to keep the loan.     So, looking at the $200,000 loan above, suppose your time frame was six years and you had a choice between two 30-year mortgages, one at 7 percent and two points and the other at 7.25 percent and one point. Using the EIR formula, the true rate on the 7 percent loan with more points is 7.33 percent, while the actual rate on the 7.25 percent loan with fewer points is 7.42 percent.     But the best way to compare loans is to calculate their after-tax cost in dollars rather than as an effective interest rate.     ""The ATC is the best measure because it takes into account not only the interest rate, points and number of years you will stay with the loans but also your tax deductions,"" says Ginsburg of Loantech.     There is no easy formula to determine the ATC, but Loantech has developed a product that can help. Its ""Rates and Fees"" computerized service contains the ATC for more than 500 possible rate-and-point combinations. The cost of the five-page report, which is based on your loan amount, loan term and marginal tax bracket, is $39.     ""You can save more than $2,000 by picking the best combination of rates and points,"" Ginsburg says.     To learn more, go to loantech .com or call 1-800-888-6781.   "

That space has been occupied by Singapore, Hong Kong and others,"" Mr Nash said on Tuesday. ""The opportunity is perhaps more niche in areas such as fintech and retirement savings.""  His remarks come as former Macquarie Group deputy chairman Mark Johnson and other financial services chiefs sought to revive the push for Australia to become more competitive in Asian financial services by releasing an updated report on Wednesday.  Mr Johnson authored a report calling for targeted tax breaks for foreign investment in locally managed funds for the Rudd Labor government seven years ago, but only a few parts of the report had been implemented in the political turmoil that ensued. ""The progress has been slow,"" said Emilio Gonzalez, the chief executive of global asset manager BT Investment Management.  ""If, at the time of releasing the report [in 2009], we would have thought this is where we will be in seven years, I think most of us would be disappointed and say that is a long time given the progress. By the same token, we have to be appreciative of where we are.""  Like Mr Johnson, Mr Gonzalez said the changes in leadership in Canberra had reduced the level of concentration in the government to make seemingly simple adjustments to policy. But he was optimistic that reductions to withholding tax rates and a simpler investment tax system would be pushed through by a new government.  ""In that environment [of multiple prime ministers], it is not surprising it is slow, but at least we are moving forward. My sense is there is will and people see the sense of it. It is not politically high on the agenda. But it is important long-term, because Asia is a growing region in terms of saving and investments.  ""Asia is one of the few regions that lends itself to middle classes coming though and a savings pool growing, and Australia has a lot to offer - if we can focus - and be part of that growth.""  Mr Nash said there was an opportunity for the new government to refine the strategy for growing financial services exports ""and perhaps be a hub for retirement savings and things of that nature, but we had better be quick and grab that"".  The KPMG chairman said these were much narrower opportunities than what Singapore had managed to achieve in the past seven years. ""The broader lesson is the agility with which Singapore sought and achieved its objective is something that should be taken on board [in Australia].""  Singapore and Hong Kong have grown their funds management sectors by offering lower tax rates to foreign investors.  Mr Gonzalez said BTIM was ready to take advantage of the Asia Region Funds Passport, which will liberalise trade in managed funds between Australia, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand.  But success in the region would depend not only on the passport platform but developing and distributing financial products that Asian customers want, he added.  ""Having the passport alone is not sufficient. You need to have the right product and the right distribution to get access to the markets.""  Mr Johnson said on Tuesday that unstable politics had robbed Australia of the chance to capitalise on its strong financial services expertise to become a hub in the region.  He said Britain's decision to quit the European Union had increased the urgency for Australia to back itself in high growth sectors such as finance.  The group calls for modest tax breaks for foreign investors in Australian managed funds - which are estimated by the Financial Services Council to reduce government revenue by only $5 million - and a less cumbersome regulatory regime. The industry says this will lure more Asian savings to Australian managers.  Mr Johnson said he wanted Australian voters to avoid another hung parliament at all costs.  Key points  Finance chiefs seek modest tax breaks for foreign investors in managed funds.  They say this will lure more Asian savings into Australia.","Australia has missed the opportunity to be a financial services hub in Asia because of political dithering, and needs to be more nimble and agile to capitalise on future opportunities, KPMG Australia chairman Peter Nash says.

Far too many of us are failing to prepare for the needed income that goes well beyond the minimum support provided by Social Security per se.  One of the most concerning attributes of today's workers is that fewer and fewer of us have the option of defined benefit pension programs.  We are responsible for providing our own nest egg of savings and investments.  Far too many of us are falling short of having the appropriate types and levels of investments to get us through our retirement years.  Dennis Quillen (Ph.

556,417924,"Referring to the growing number of possible triage situations, Dr. Andrea Kittrell, a Lynchburg, Va. otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist) says: “I have white knuckles, I mean it’s coming.”  She has been in private practice for over 20 years and is chair of the medical ethics committee at her regional hospital system.  The Save Other Souls advance directive idea  One night last March, when Kittrell had trouble sleeping, she had an idea.  “I started contemplating mortality, thinking about some of my patients over the course of my career who I would ask, ‘How are you?’ And they’d say, ‘You know, I’m fantastic. If God took me today, that would be fine with me.’ Or ‘I’ve had a good life,’” she said. “So I started wondering: if there are people who would need to be treated for COVID at a hospital that faced a shortage of medical resources, who would be ready to accept death? Maybe those patients would want other people to have their chance to live.”  Then a lightbulb went off for Kittrell. Why not a COVID-19-specific advance directive to supplement other advance directives that tell health care providers your wishes regarding lifesaving treatments and procedures?  So, she formed a nonprofit, built a website and in April 2020, her Save Other Souls (SOS) advance directive was born.  It lets people (regardless of age or racial or ethnic background) sign instructions in advance of any potential COVID-19 hospitalization that read as follows: “It is my wish and direction that any health care providers and others involved in my care DIRECT RESOURCES TO OTHERS THAN TO ME AS SET FORTH BELOW.  In other words, give my seat in the lifeboat to someone else.  But it’s more complicated than that.  Below the line to direct care to others is this statement and three checkboxes:  “In the event of shortages, I am willing to receive compassionate palliative care instead of one or more of the following (check all that apply):  Critical medical equipment (ventilator, ECMO, etc.)  Medication (other than palliative)  Critical Care services in a hospital setting  Who’s using it and why  Kittrell has received some voluntary data and email addresses from people who have recently downloaded the SOS directive.

One person who did is Winnona Merritt, 83, an organic gardener in High Point N.C.  She says she’s in really good health. But as a member of the Bahai faith, Merritt believes “people are created as altruists and to be a servant of humanity.” That’s why, when filling out the SOS advance directive, Merritt checked all three boxes.  Also on MarketWatch: I have a seven-figure nest egg — am I saving too much for retirement?  If she needs hospitalization for COVID-19, her directive says, she’ll be willing to forego medical equipment, medication (other than palliative) and critical care services.

He was among the team a decade ago that reviewed guidance for clinicians and hospital administrators on how to allocate limited medical resources during H1N1 (the swine flu) and future pandemics.  Wynia knows there are altruistic people like Merritt who might willingly give up their spot in line for coronavirus care because some of them have contacted him and said so.  But Wynia has concerns about the SOS directive itself.  He asks: “Can you manage this process through a website? A check box is particularly worrisome. If you say, ‘I would want critical medical equipment but don’t want a medication,’ that doesn’t make sense. You can’t be on a ventilator without sedation and pain relief.”  See: This New York City medical ethicist has never been so busy  Before signing the SOS directive, Wynia advises, “it’s critical to have a thorough conversation with someone who might actually be there at the time difficult decisions need to be made.”  In response, Kittrell says: “The SOS directive, like all advance directives, is a very personal document which should be thoughtful and carefully considered prior to signing. But, she adds, unlike a Do Not Resuscitate order, “the SOS directive is not a medical order and would serve as guidance in the triage process, not as refusal of care.”  When Kittrell came up with the SOS advance directive idea, she turned to Dr. Michael Gillette, a bioethicist contracted with her hospital group.  Also see: My co-workers cough and sneeze, don’t wear masks, and talk about their parties. I’m worried about coronavirus. What do I do?  “We are used to talking about how we manage a [health care] situation where demand outpaces supply. What’s new here is that we’re even contemplating, under the COVID pandemic scenario, taking resources away from one person or give them to someone else,” Gillette said. “A very [immune] compromised 40-year-old would get a lower priority because of their likelihood of survival than a healthier older person.”  The SOS directive, Gillette said, “might actually be more interesting to people who are very healthy and chosen to receive the [COVID-19 health] resource but want to give up that spot in order to help someone else.”  The view from the Save Other Souls creator  I asked Kittrell if she would be willing to sign her own SOS advance directive.

Councilors also opted to retain the single tax rate for residential and commercial/industrial properties. Town Administrator Jeffrey Nutting said the town has historically had a single rate. Some communities have dual tax rates in which commercial and industrial properties are taxed differently, often higher, than homes.  Nutting noted that the average price of a single-family home in town had increased from $381,200 to $398,300. As a result, the average residential bill would climb from $5,657 to $5,775 - a 2.1 percent change. The average commercial tax bill would increase by $240, he said, though he noted there is a greater variance in the values of commercial properties.  Officials noted that the increase was lower than those of the past few years. According to town paperwork, the average single-family bill jumped $397 in fiscal year 2015, and $270 in fiscal year 2014.  Ken Norman, chairman of the Board of Assessors, gave the council a brief update on the assessors' efforts and conclusions.  “We're still a town with a tax base that is 80 percent residential and 20 percent commercial/industrial,"" he said.  Nutting told the council that the valuations tend to lag behind the actual real estate market. He said this meant the values would likely rise in the future, as there has been good activity in the local market.  Council member Judith Pfeffer said that while the tax burden on local homeowners is not skyrocketing, it could be difficult for seniors in town to afford the increase.

Some communities have dual tax rates in which commercial and industrial properties are taxed differently, often higher, than homes.  Nutting noted that the average price of a single-family home in town had increased from $381,200 to $398,300. As a result, the average residential bill would climb from $5,657 to $5,775 - a 2.1 percent change. The average commercial tax bill would increase by $240, he said, though he noted there is a greater variance in the values of commercial properties.  Officials noted that the increase was lower than those of the past few years. According to town paperwork, the average single-family bill jumped $397 in fiscal year 2015, and $270 in fiscal year 2014.  Ken Norman, chairman of the Board of Assessors, gave the council a brief update on the assessors' efforts and conclusions.  “We're still a town with a tax base that is 80 percent residential and 20 percent commercial/industrial,"" he said.  Nutting told the council that the valuations tend to lag behind the actual real estate market. He said this meant the values would likely rise in the future, as there has been good activity in the local market.  Council member Judith Pfeffer said that while the tax burden on local homeowners is not skyrocketing, it could be difficult for seniors in town to afford the increase. She asked that information about the senior work-off program — in which senior citizens can reduce their bills in exchange for volunteer work — be placed more prominently on the town website.  “I know, since we put this into effect, we've never turned anyone aside,"" she said.  — Mike Gleason can be reached at 508-634-7546 or mgleason@wickedlocal.com.

In a rush one day, she cut the feet off her panty hose and threw them on to create a smooth silhouette under her pants. Forget law. She now owns a multibillion-dollar underwear business.  Being an entrepreneur usually starts with a dream, an accidental vision, a wish to be the king or queen of your own kingdom. It requires a desire to play the rules of work your way — to do the daily business just as Frank Sinatra sang in ""My Way.""  But how do you get there?  First, it requires personal characteristics that subscribe to a principle of hard, diligent, informed and dedicated work. You will need operating capital — a loan from your bank, family or a hefty credit line on a plastic credit card. You may need some staff. You will need an efficient and congenial place to work for you and however many staff members you'll need.  You also will need physical, mental and emotional stamina to weather the financial and emotional ups and downs of being an entrepreneur.  Your pathway to entrepreneurship will require emotional and professional support from your staff. But the rewards: It's your kingdom. You are in charge. You are your own boss.  The Oklahoman talked to entrepreneurs, ranging in age from the late 20s to the late 70s, to find out what they loved most about being an entrepreneur, and what were the obstacles they had to overcome.  Each story, each motivation, recalls a singular moment in the entrepreneur's life when he chose to make his business life a work of his own choosing.  Joy Reed Belt  ""Did you want to start with the lemonade stand?"" Joy Reed Belt said with a laugh. ""I really had one. I also had a book-leasing company in grade school, where I would lease books to students for a nickel or a dime. Or were you more interested in my time in graduate school when I was the landlord of an old mansion in Arkansas, where I rented out rooms to female graduate students?""  That was a very successful venture, Belt said, so successful she didn't have to borrow money to attend graduate school.  She officially became an entrepreneur in 1979, working out of a bedroom she converted to her office, and began her executive search company. By 1992, her business was so successful, she bought a large two-story building on Grand Boulevard and Western that is often called ""the pink building with the purple door, next door to Flip's.""  The interiors are filled with antiques and fine art, a library, a full kitchen and rooms where people looking for executive positions can work on their resumes, often with personal advice from Belt, based on her immense experience and expertise.  ""I like the act of creating,"" Belt said. ""That always has been fascinating to me. When you're starting something you've never done before, friends want a template they can follow, too. I'm hooked on this creative business. I love the process of figuring out how to do something I've never done before. This business as an executive search consultant is really my child.""  Belt balances two businesses. In 2001, Belt's husband, attorney John Belt, bought her some painting lessons to encourage her to relax. The gift didn't quite work out the way John planned. She found making collages more creative than painting, but she learned about art while taking those lessons.  In 2001, she became part owner of a gallery in The Paseo. In 2005, she and John bought the former home of Nan Sheets, founder of the Oklahoma City Museum of Art, and restored its position in the community as a fine art gallery.  Today, JRB Art at the Elms is known for its unusual monthly shows that feature a variety of art mediums. In May, she will move both of her businesses to the Paseo gallery, leaving behind the pink building she has called her business home for 16 years. Chesapeake Energy has bought that building.  Her advice to budding entrepreneurs?  ""You have to have a high tolerance for risk. You have to promote yourself and your business. Know your clients' background so you know how to help them. Be competitive and adaptable. As an entrepreneur, there's no guarantee you're going to get a regular paycheck. You have to believe you can do it. Believe in yourself and follow your dream.""

There's not much French being spoken on the 10th floor of The Oil Center, where Bumps operates her insurance business. But if you like to talk about employee benefits, she'll listen.  She started her career as a merchandising manager with J.C. Penney Co. Inc., and her husband was then a young executive with Wilson Foods. Then, she was approached to sell insurance for Connecticut Mutual Life and handle its employee benefits program.  ""There was a salary, no risk, and it seemed worth a shot,"" she remembers.

By 2002, she had 125 employees and offered every type of self-funded insurance to a variety of individuals and companies, serving a multitude of needs for her large clientele.  She helps employers work with benefits that make a business environment user-friendly, not only to executives but to all the support personnel and clients.  While she has trimmed her staff to 14 and sold off some aspects of the company, she is proud of the fact that many of her clients have been with her since she opened the business.

This year, she is celebrating her 10th anniversary as owner of Lisa's Belle de Jour, a spa boutique at 4410 N Western. For eight years, the spa was on Britton Road.  When she opened her spa, there were plenty of hair salons that offered pedicures and manicures, but very few spas devoted to skin care.  A graduate of the University of Central Oklahoma with a degree in fashion merchandising, she always wanted to own a clothing store. Her boutique does sell some jewelry, but Shambour's main mission is to sell skin-care products.  As a full-service spa, she offers manicures, pedicures, hair styling, massages, exfoliation and pigmentation treatments, micro-dermabrasion, and lash and brow tinting. ""We take care of our clients from head to toe,"" she said.  She brings to the spa her experience of being trained in German and French skin-care techniques in Paris.  ""Skin care is a big part of the European lifestyle,"" Shambour said. ""In France, it's a necessity. French people like to feel good inside and out, and they are very conscious of proper skin care. It seems to me the French age very gracefully.""  What Shambour also provides to her clients is a delightful atmosphere, based on her love for Paris. The decor is feminine, with a pink-and-black color scheme, accented by red. Several of the rooms are dressed in a soft light green to provide some contrast to the pink and black. The eye-catching pink velvet love seat stars in the main reception area, accented with accessories that Shambour calls ""modern-day Paris.""  While she loves the setting she has created for her clients, Shambour said, ""Meeting people and helping them feel good about themselves is the best part of owning the spa.""

Although he turned over the reins of the company to his son Shannon, Roberson still keeps close ties with the company. He recently received his master's degree in business from a Kentucky university. ""I wanted the degree to hang on my wall,"" he said.  His two children and grandchildren all have college degrees, and Roberson thought it was time to join the ranks of the family's degree holders. He also has an honorary doctorate from Oklahoma Christian College.  He grew up rather impoverished in Texas and New Mexico and couldn't afford college, yet he is close friends with six presidents of regional universities, including David Boren of the University of Oklahoma.

561,95338,"The objective of the WRS is to provide a retirement benefit that, when combined with Social Security benefits, produces a total retirement benefit of between 50 and 85% of your pre-retirement earnings. This assumes you will have a full career of public employment (approximately 25-35 years of service) and retire at your normal retirement age (anywhere from age 53 to 65, depending on your employment category). Making additional contributions is an especially good idea if the majority of your career was not covered under the WRS.     Are contributions tax-deferred? There are two kinds of additional contributions: regular (after-tax) and tax-deferred. Under federal law, the only participants who can make tax-deferred additional contributions are employees of educational institutions that have had a tax-deferred agreement with the Department of Employee Trust Funds (ETF) since before 1982. If you work for an educational institution, contact your employer for information about whether it has such an agreement with ETF. For regular (after-tax) contributions, interest earned is not taxed until you take a distribution.     How do I make additional contributions? You can make regular contributions either through your employer or by submitting a check directly to the WRS. There is no specific form for making additional contributions, but if you send a check directly to ETF, include a letter that provides your name, Social Security number, and the reason you are submitting the payment. Tax-deferred contributions must be submitted by your employer through a salary reduction agreement.     What interest do I receive on my additional contributions? Your additional contribution balance as of January 1 is credited with effective rate interest (core fund rate and, if applicable, the variable fund effective rate) each December 31. For example, your January 1, 2007, additional contribution balance would receive 2007 effective rate interest on December 31, 2007. It is important to note that your additional contributions do not begin to earn interest until the January 1 after we receive them. For example, additional contributions received during 2007 will be credited with interest for 2008 on December 31, 2008, but no interest will be credited for 2007 regardless of when in 2007 we received the contributions.     Can I withdraw my additional contributions while I am still working under the WRS? You cannot withdraw these funds until you have terminated all employment covered under the WRS. The law does not provide any exceptions for hardship situations.     What about tax liabilities when I take a benefit? The amount of your benefit from investment earnings on your regular (after-tax) additional contributions is fully taxable. The entire amount of your benefit from tax-deferred additional contributions is fully taxable (because they were paid with pre-tax dollars).

How does it work? If your credit score isn't high enough to qualify for a loan or credit card, or sits on the cusp of getting a better rate, a lender can offer to use your banking activity to generate an UltraFICO Score. You also can choose which accounts – checking, savings or money market – will be considered in the recalculation. The score uses the same 300-to-850 range that other FICO scores have.  Experian, one of the three main credit bureaus, will gather your bank account data using Finicity, a financial tech company, and send the new score plus a summary of your bank accounts to the lender for a second evaluation. Experian will maintain bank account data to address accuracy disputes.  It's possible that your credit score could decrease after the new banking information is added, according to Taylor-Shoff, so it's important to understand when your bank account could help you.  What is a good bank account? The biggest factors are average account balance and history of overdrawn accounts. Those who maintain an average balance of $400 and show no negative balances in the previous three months will benefit the most from the UltraFICO Score, Taylor-Shoff said. Other positive factors FICO considers include having more deposits than outflows, having an account open and active for some time, and regularly paying bills such as utilities and rent from these accounts.  Seven in 10 people who demonstrate responsible checking and savings account behavior can improve their score under the UltraFICO scoring system, the company said, some by as much as 20 points. That can translate into a lower interest rate or the difference between approval and denial.  The new score begins its pilot program at the beginning of next year.","You may soon earn a higher credit score if you balance your checkbook responsibly.

567,1145057,"Even an amicable separation can drain money out of both parties' pockets if care is not used when the assets are split.  ``Most couples try hard to arrive at a settlement that works for both partners,'' says William Newell, a financial planner in Sherborn, Mass. ``Unfortunately, what seems fair now may not remain equitable in the future.''  Newell's point is that when one partner (typically the wife) walks away with the house while the other (usually the husband) walks away with higher earning power and a retirement nest egg, the house-bound spouse usually ends up poorer and the other spouse ends up richer.  In addition to the expenses involved in upkeep of the house, the person who ends up with the house may later end up paying taxes on the home's sale, though this is less likely given recent changes in capital gains laws.  Furthermore, those changes may affect divorcing couples who sell their homes. In order to qualify for the $250,000 per person exclusion on home sales capital gains, you have to have been living in the house for at least two of the last five years before the sale. If one spouse moves out and it is four years before the house is sold, the spouse that moved out will lose that break.  It's also important to consider intangible assets, like employee benefits, future Social Security benefits and future earnings potential, when splitting up property, says Newell.  There are many other considerations, too. Alimony is tax deductible but child support is not, reports Mark Luscombe, a CPA and federal tax analyst for CCH Inc. in Riverwoods, Ill., a tax publishing company. But the Internal Revenue Service frowns on couples who use tax-deductible alimony instead of child support and can reclassify obvious child-focused alimony payments, such as those that end when a child turns 18, into non-deductible child support.  When parents split custody and support, it's important to work out ahead of time who will get to take the child as a dependent; only one parent can get the credits and exemptions associated with that.  Luscombe also notes that the period when the couple may be separated but is still legally married can be the most tax complex. They must either file a return together or, if they file separately, make sure that their returns match on items like what's deducted and what isn't.  Even if the children of the divorcing couple are very young, it's important that a plan for paying for college be worked out at the time of the divorce. Studies have shown that children of divorce go on to college less frequently than their cohorts from intact families. Often that is because the money just isn't there.  And retirement plans that don't get divided at the time of the divorce may not be able to protect their tax-favored status should the couple decide at a later time to use some of that money to settle a divorce-related obligation.  Finally, remember that in at least one key way divorce is just like all other significant life cycle events. As Violet Woodhouse, Victoria Collins and M.C. Blakeman point out in their book ``Divorce & Money'' (1998, Nolo Press), ``In divorce, everything takes longer and costs more than you imagine.''

570,330463," It was also rumoured these companies' with-profits funds would not accept new business from now and the investment fund would get rid of its equity holdings, leaving it with only gilts, fixed interest or property in the fund in future. So just when the industry seemed to have weathered the worst financial storms for more than 70 years, the Aussies are throwing in the towel.    But is there a future for the with-profits policy? In my view, the writing has been on the wall for these products for 30 years.    In the very early 70s, the with-profits concept worked fairly well, providing decent long-term returns to endowment and pension investors. But economic circumstances and our way of life were different then. Savers had much longer-term horizons. People worked in the same career to 65 or later and often worked with the same employer throughout a working lifetime.    Back then, we had come through a period of low inflation, low interest rates and little opposition to the with-profits concept.    Typical terms for policies in these days were 35 years or longer and it was common for severe penalties to apply for those who cashed in early. And inside pension policies, there were Draconian penalties for those who were unfortunate enough to die before retirement.    So thanks to a combination of investor patience, long-term horizons, benign economic circumstances and the ability of the fund managers to massage investment returns by being able to penalise early leavers and early deaths, returns were reasonable for those lucky enough to keep the plans over the term. But they were inflexible and would not cope with short-term horizons.    They would also find it difficult to cope with rapidly-changing tax legislation, demographic pressures and developments within the investment world, all of which added up to a need for greater flexibility. This is not a word to describe old with-profits plans.    So as the careers and needs of investors changed the old with-profits Victorian model was losing the battle. In a vain attempt to compete, the wise succumbed to sales and marketing visions and common sense went out the window. With-profits performances looked better because they plundered the kitty.    The purpose of the kitty was to provide bonuses in all the years, even the bad ones. As everybody knows, you get good years and bad years and with-profits were supposed to keep a healthy kitty to make up for the bad years.    Things were made worse by simultaneously continuing to back equities at the wrong time. They're not the only ones who got it wrong. But once the equity markets start looking positive again, the worst thing that could happen to with-profits funds is you chuck in the towel at the wrong time.    If I had been the Aussies, I wouldn't have had anything to do with with-profits in the first place because the damage had been done a long time ago.    But what do you do if you're left with one of these plans? I would be prepared to take it on the chin in most cases, swallow the penalties now and redirect savings into better-managed, tax-efficient investment plans sitting inside the best modern structure, not some rehash of another Victorian folly.

Cockett explained that Tier II tuition is used for university initiatives. The money is used to put USUSA ideas into action. Cockett said she specifically wants to use this funding for disability resources.  Peters added that Tier II tuition will be used for compliance issues, specifically with sexual assault, mental health and speeding up the process for Title IX investigations. Funds will also go to the Sexual Assault and Anti-Violence Information office.  Tier II tuition will increase by 2.4 percent.

573,966664,"And the great unknown is whether longer-standing investors will cash in as the capital gains tax rate falls for housing investments from up to 40% to 18% from April 6. Some estimates put the number of properties to be sold as high as 20%. The downturn in buy-to-let is expected to have an impact beyond the pounds 15bn two-bedroom-flat market on to the rest of the housing market, according to research published this week.     ""The buy-to-let market is simply not large enough to cause a general downturn all by itself,"" says Fitch, the credit ratings agency, in its report Demystify ing UK Buy to Let. ""But the high concentration of buy-to-let in the crucial London market, and ill-judged media speculation, could trigger a domino effect that impacts the wider market.""     The report also cites the rapid construction of flats as fuelling fears of over-supply. Thousands of newly built flats in cities such as Leeds, Manchester and Nottingham, as well as London, remain empty or let at rents that do not cover mortgages.     ""Funding is now severely limited,"" says banking analyst Alex Potter at stockbrokers Collins Stewart. ""Several lenders are buy-to-let dependent and buy-to-let has never been tested in a market downturn.""     Moneyfacts, the data provider, calculates that 3,662 buy-to-let mortgages were available last August. Now there are only 926 and this week alone three major buy-to-let lenders have pulled out of significant market sectors.     Birmingham Midshires, the buy-to-let specialist in the  HBOS empire, withdrew its ""110% rental cover"" loans, where it would lend if the mortgage was covered 110% by the expected rent, and now requires at least 125% cover from new borrowers. Wave, part of  Merrill Lynch, stopped offering ""almost prime"" buy-to-let loans. ""Almost prime"" means the borrower has one or two black credit-record marks.     And buy-to-let specialist Paragon, which has run out of money for new loans with the ending of a funding facility, has withdrawn its range. It is now limited to topping up existing borrowers depending on the amount it redeems from those re-mortgaging or paying off their loans.     Paragon has a pounds 12bn mortgage book and although its typical loan-to-value is 65%, many customers borrowed far greater percentages to buy new-build flats. Its shares have fallen 85% to 103p since buy-to-let lending hit its peak in the middle of 2006.     In June 2006, the most attractive buy-to-let pounds 200,000 loan cost 4.49% fixed for two years with a 1.5% fee, amounting to pounds 832.90 a month. Now the best value is 5.34% fixed for two years plus a 2.5% fee - pounds 906.85 a month, according to Moneyfacts.     But these are the best loans. Those who bought flats that have fallen in value are forced on to standard variable rates that can be as high as 8.75% - the rate charged by specialist lender GMAC.     GMAC has customers whose repayments per property could rise by more than pounds 500 a month - an amount that is almost impossible to recoup from tenants. But as GMAC sold on its loans, no one really knows who will pick up the losses for the bad debts. Much of the buy-to-let market is characterised by packaging and selling on of loans.     For example, Chris Miller, from Bedford, bought 31 flats valued by surveyors at pounds 7.5m late last summer for pounds 6.4m. He borrowed pounds 6.4m, much of it from GMAC. But when nearly all were repossessed this year as he could not rent them, he found that many of the loans had been sold on to the likes of  Bradford & Bingley and  Morgan Stanley. His port folio is unlikely to fetch more than pounds 3m at auction, a pounds 3.4m loss to lenders.     Fitch argues that even when flats have tenants, the typical gross rental yield of about 5% falls to 3% once empty periods and maintenance are factored in. This compares with returns of 6% or more from savings accounts.     ""A first test of the sector's impact will follow the introduction of the lower capital gains rate,"" Fitch adds. ""Our view is that buy-to-let constitutes a segment of the housing market which is more likely to accelerate, rather than dampen, a downturn environment.""     Potter, at Collins Stewart, agrees: ""No one knows the concentration risk - how much is in overpriced new-build flats - or just how well the typical two-year mortgage duration is suited to buy-to-let. Lenders believed the benign conditions would go on for ever. But if building slows, the Polish construction workers so many landlords need will go back home. And then the buy-to-let tail could wag the property dog.""     Battersea Reach flats on the river Thames.

574,1482295,"While it might seem far-off, your 20s is the prime time to start saving and planning for retirement — thanks to the power of compound interest.  * Start saving for retirement early. It's a long way off, but put retirement on your list of goals. If your employer offers a 401(k) or a Roth 401(k), aim to contribute 10 percent to 15 percent of your income. The longer you wait to start, the larger the percentage you’ll need to save. If you don’t have a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, open a Roth IRA. A Roth is a good choice for a young person because, while you don’t get the tax advantage up front, withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, when you’ll likely be in a higher tax bracket.  * Don’t leave “free money” on the table. Most companies will match a portion of your 401(k) contributions. Sign up and contribute at least enough to qualify for the max. Some employers also may make annual contributions to your tax-advantaged health savings accounts or offer the option to buy company stock at a discount. Familiarize yourself with these benefits and take advantage.  * Invest for growth. While you’re young, invest in a growth strategy since you’ve got time on your side to recover from a potential down market. Be diversified and think about your risk tolerance, but at this stage, you should focus on asset growth.  * Start a rainy-day fund. Schwab’s Modern Wealth Index (MWI) found that only 28 percent of millennials have an emergency fund to cover three months of expenses. Be sure to prepare for emergencies, such as job loss, with three to six months’ worth of living expenses.  * Pay down debt. MWI found only 33 percent of millennials make all loan payments and 31 percent pay their credit cards in full each month. Student loans and credit card debt can add up, and missing payments can hurt your credit score, which matters for rent and loan assessments.  In Your 30s  As you enter your 30s, there are competing demands on your time and money. Whether it be saving for your kids’ education or contributing toward your retirement, here are key things to keep in mind for these years.  * Keep saving. If you’re just starting, aim to save 15 percent to 20 percent of your income. If you've been saving 10 percent to 15 percent for retirement since your 20s, good work, and keep it up!  * Get a financial plan. Planning is one of the most critical factors to successful investing, but Schwab’s research reveals that less than a quarter of Americans have a written financial plan. A comprehensive financial plan is your road map to help you stay on track with your financial goals and manage wealth, particularly as your life evolves and finances become more complicated.  * Remember your old 401(k) when changing jobs. Your 30s are a time of professional advancement, so if you are changing jobs, don’t blindly leave your 401(k) savings in the rear view. When you switch jobs, you can leave your money where it is, roll it over into your new employer's 401(k) plan, or roll it over into an individual retirement account. You can also cash it out, but that’s almost never a good idea. To decide which is best for you, consider how your fees, taxes and investment options may be impacted.  * Start saving early for kids' college. If you begin investing $300 per month as soon as your child is born, with a 6 percent rate of return, you could have $115,000 by the time he/she reaches age 18. Yet, if you don’t start saving until your child is 10 years old, the final amount will be roughly $37,000.  * Create an estate plan. At the very minimum, you should establish a will that names a guardian for your children (if you have any). You also should make sure you name beneficiaries for all retirement accounts, as these designations will take precedence over your will.  In Your 40s  You’re likely earning more as your career advances, but you’re also facing more financial pressures. It’s easy to get distracted, so here are some tips to stay focused.  * Double down on savings. Keep retirement at the top of your priorities. If you haven’t started saving, set aside 25 percent of your salary. You are probably contributing enough to take advantage of your employer’s 401(k) match, but consider maximizing your annual contribution: $18,000 for 2017 for workers under age 50. For both traditional and Roth IRAs, the maximum you can contribute is $5,500 for workers under the age of 50.  * Update your financial plan. You should get in the habit of reviewing your financial plan annually and at major life events to make sure it’s current and that your investment portfolio is aligned with your short- and long-term goals, as well as your risk tolerance. At this stage, you may think about a second home or early retirement, so it’s important to crunch the numbers to see what it will take to reach them.  * Protect yourself and your family. Now that you have more money working for you, make sure you’re protected. Look into disability insurance and consider life insurance if you have dependents.  * Don’t be too conservative. While you shouldn’t take the same risks you did in your 20s, you still have 20+ years to reap potential gains from investments. Being cautious now could mean coming up short later, so consider having a large portion of your portfolio in equities.  * Know your tax profile. Understand how taxes fit into your financial picture, now and in the future.  In Your 50s  As you approach peak earning years in your 50s, it makes sense to start thinking more specifically about retirement planning; it may be only 15 years away. Consider these priorities to make sure you are on track.  * Estimate your retirement expenses. Begin thinking about when you want to retire, where you want to live and what you want to do. Will you travel or work part-time, or move to a different city? Once you know your vision, you can determine how much your retirement is going to cost and how you are going to pay for it.  * Stay on top of your financial plan and your portfolio. Review and update your financial plan and your investment portfolio and consider when it makes sense to begin shifting to a more conservative asset allocation as you near retirement.  * Consider long-term-care insurance. Now’s a practical time to think about it.  * Consider boosting your savings level. As your salary increases, so should your retirement contributions. Starting at age 50, investors can contribute an extra $6,000 to their 401(k) for an annual contribution of $24,000, and an extra $1,000 to their IRA for an annual contribution of $6,500, per current IRS rules.  * Update your estate plan. Make sure that your will and beneficiaries are up to date and that your assets are appropriately titled.  In Your 60s  With retirement nearing, it’s imperative that people in their 60s focus on preparations for life after work.  * Understand your real spending. While many guess how much they spend, it’s important to be accurate — so dig up bank statements and look at what the real outflow is.  * Tackle debt and major expenses. Fifty seven percent of Americans can’t make loan payments on time and 63 percent hold credit card debt (according to recent Schwab research), so this is the time to pay down “bad” debt before it becomes a burden in retirement.  * Decide when to take Social Security. Many people file for Social Security too early, leaving thousands of dollars on the table. You should keep in mind, the longer you wait up to age 70, the bigger your check once you begin collecting.  * Sign up for Medicare: Unless you’re still working, you must sign up by age 65 or face a penalty. As medical costs can be a big part of retirement expenses, be sure to look into a supplemental policy, too.  * Fine-tune your retirement income plan. Review your projected expenses, add up your reliable sources of income and figure out how your portfolio will cover the gap. Consider gradually moving to a more conservative asset allocation, but don’t walk away from growth: Retirement can last a long time — approximately 20 years or more.  In Your Retirement  With Americans living longer than ever, retirement is increasingly becoming its own journey rather than a destination. For a lengthy, fulfilling retirement, start with this checklist.  * Review your situation. Project what you’ll need to cover one month’s and one year’s costs, divvying expenses into essential (housing, health care) and discretionary (trips) categories.  * Explore retirement income strategies. A few common approaches include relying upon 1) interest and dividends only, 2) a “total return” strategy, which uses a combination of interest, dividends and withdrawals from principal, and 3) a “total return” with an annuity that incorporates annuity income into a ""total return"" approach.  * Match your investments to your goals and needs. While it’s a crucial factor to consider in creating your retirement income plan, it’s unlikely that savings will ever outpace long-term inflation. One way to counteract this is keeping a segment of savings in growth-oriented stock investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs). Balancing funds – in any distribution – between fixed income, cash investments and stocks is essential to long-term success.  * Rebalance annually and stay flexible. Annual retirement portfolio rebalancing is especially important when you're retired, as a portfolio that's out of balance can leave you with more risk or less growth potential than you want. You should periodically revisit your retirement portfolio asset allocation to stay aligned with your investment goals and expected time horizon.  Did you find this article useful?

Editor’s note : We reached out to executives who work in financial planning for their thoughts on what people should be thinking about at various life stages for wealth management. Here are comments as conveyed by Joe Vietri, branch network leader at Charles Schwab.

In Your 20s
While it might seem far-off, your 20s is the prime time to start saving and planning for retirement — thanks to the power of compound interest.  * Start saving for retirement early. It's a long way off, but put retirement on your list of goals. If your employer offers a 401(k) or a Roth 401(k), aim to contribute 10 percent to 15 percent of your income. The longer you wait to start, the larger the percentage you’ll need to save. If you don’t have a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, open a Roth IRA. A Roth is a good choice for a young person because, while you don’t get the tax advantage up front, withdrawals are tax-free after age 59½, when you’ll likely be in a higher tax bracket.  * Don’t leave “free money” on the table. Most companies will match a portion of your 401(k) contributions. Sign up and contribute at least enough to qualify for the max. Some employers also may make annual contributions to your tax-advantaged health savings accounts or offer the option to buy company stock at a discount. Familiarize yourself with these benefits and take advantage.  * Invest for growth. While you’re young, invest in a growth strategy since you’ve got time on your side to recover from a potential down market. Be diversified and think about your risk tolerance, but at this stage, you should focus on asset growth.  * Start a rainy-day fund. Schwab’s Modern Wealth Index (MWI) found that only 28 percent of millennials have an emergency fund to cover three months of expenses. Be sure to prepare for emergencies, such as job loss, with three to six months’ worth of living expenses.  * Pay down debt. MWI found only 33 percent of millennials make all loan payments and 31 percent pay their credit cards in full each month. Student loans and credit card debt can add up, and missing payments can hurt your credit score, which matters for rent and loan assessments.  In Your 30s  As you enter your 30s, there are competing demands on your time and money. Whether it be saving for your kids’ education or contributing toward your retirement, here are key things to keep in mind for these years.  * Keep saving. If you’re just starting, aim to save 15 percent to 20 percent of your income. If you've been saving 10 percent to 15 percent for retirement since your 20s, good work, and keep it up!  * Get a financial plan. Planning is one of the most critical factors to successful investing, but Schwab’s research reveals that less than a quarter of Americans have a written financial plan. A comprehensive financial plan is your road map to help you stay on track with your financial goals and manage wealth, particularly as your life evolves and finances become more complicated.  * Remember your old 401(k) when changing jobs. Your 30s are a time of professional advancement, so if you are changing jobs, don’t blindly leave your 401(k) savings in the rear view. When you switch jobs, you can leave your money where it is, roll it over into your new employer's 401(k) plan, or roll it over into an individual retirement account. You can also cash it out, but that’s almost never a good idea. To decide which is best for you, consider how your fees, taxes and investment options may be impacted.  * Start saving early for kids' college. If you begin investing $300 per month as soon as your child is born, with a 6 percent rate of return, you could have $115,000 by the time he/she reaches age 18. Yet, if you don’t start saving until your child is 10 years old, the final amount will be roughly $37,000.  * Create an estate plan. At the very minimum, you should establish a will that names a guardian for your children (if you have any). You also should make sure you name beneficiaries for all retirement accounts, as these designations will take precedence over your will.  In Your 40s  You’re likely earning more as your career advances, but you’re also facing more financial pressures. It’s easy to get distracted, so here are some tips to stay focused.  * Double down on savings. Keep retirement at the top of your priorities. If you haven’t started saving, set aside 25 percent of your salary. You are probably contributing enough to take advantage of your employer’s 401(k) match, but consider maximizing your annual contribution: $18,000 for 2017 for workers under age 50. For both traditional and Roth IRAs, the maximum you can contribute is $5,500 for workers under the age of 50.  * Update your financial plan. You should get in the habit of reviewing your financial plan annually and at major life events to make sure it’s current and that your investment portfolio is aligned with your short- and long-term goals, as well as your risk tolerance. At this stage, you may think about a second home or early retirement, so it’s important to crunch the numbers to see what it will take to reach them.  * Protect yourself and your family. Now that you have more money working for you, make sure you’re protected. Look into disability insurance and consider life insurance if you have dependents.  * Don’t be too conservative. While you shouldn’t take the same risks you did in your 20s, you still have 20+ years to reap potential gains from investments. Being cautious now could mean coming up short later, so consider having a large portion of your portfolio in equities.  * Know your tax profile. Understand how taxes fit into your financial picture, now and in the future.  In Your 50s  As you approach peak earning years in your 50s, it makes sense to start thinking more specifically about retirement planning; it may be only 15 years away. Consider these priorities to make sure you are on track.  * Estimate your retirement expenses. Begin thinking about when you want to retire, where you want to live and what you want to do. Will you travel or work part-time, or move to a different city? Once you know your vision, you can determine how much your retirement is going to cost and how you are going to pay for it.  * Stay on top of your financial plan and your portfolio. Review and update your financial plan and your investment portfolio and consider when it makes sense to begin shifting to a more conservative asset allocation as you near retirement.  * Consider long-term-care insurance. Now’s a practical time to think about it.  * Consider boosting your savings level. As your salary increases, so should your retirement contributions. Starting at age 50, investors can contribute an extra $6,000 to their 401(k) for an annual contribution of $24,000, and an extra $1,000 to their IRA for an annual contribution of $6,500, per current IRS rules.  * Update your estate plan. Make sure that your will and beneficiaries are up to date and that your assets are appropriately titled.  In Your 60s  With retirement nearing, it’s imperative that people in their 60s focus on preparations for life after work.  * Understand your real spending. While many guess how much they spend, it’s important to be accurate — so dig up bank statements and look at what the real outflow is.  * Tackle debt and major expenses. Fifty seven percent of Americans can’t make loan payments on time and 63 percent hold credit card debt (according to recent Schwab research), so this is the time to pay down “bad” debt before it becomes a burden in retirement.  * Decide when to take Social Security. Many people file for Social Security too early, leaving thousands of dollars on the table. You should keep in mind, the longer you wait up to age 70, the bigger your check once you begin collecting.  * Sign up for Medicare: Unless you’re still working, you must sign up by age 65 or face a penalty. As medical costs can be a big part of retirement expenses, be sure to look into a supplemental policy, too.  * Fine-tune your retirement income plan. Review your projected expenses, add up your reliable sources of income and figure out how your portfolio will cover the gap. Consider gradually moving to a more conservative asset allocation, but don’t walk away from growth: Retirement can last a long time — approximately 20 years or more.  In Your Retirement  With Americans living longer than ever, retirement is increasingly becoming its own journey rather than a destination. For a lengthy, fulfilling retirement, start with this checklist.  * Review your situation. Project what you’ll need to cover one month’s and one year’s costs, divvying expenses into essential (housing, health care) and discretionary (trips) categories.  * Explore retirement income strategies. A few common approaches include relying upon 1) interest and dividends only, 2) a “total return” strategy, which uses a combination of interest, dividends and withdrawals from principal, and 3) a “total return” with an annuity that incorporates annuity income into a ""total return"" approach.  * Match your investments to your goals and needs.

575,647537,"""With today's EPW Committee vote, our bipartisan bill is now one step closer to protecting America's waterways and our farmers, ranchers and landowners,"" said Barrasso. ""I will push for the Senate to pass this bill immediately so we can send EPA back to the drawing board to write a new rule that truly reflects the needs of all Americans.""  Senator Barrasso introduced S. 1140 on April 30, 2015 with Senator Joe Donnelly (D-IN), EPW Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-OK), Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), Pat Roberts (R-KS), Joe Manchin (D-WV) and 33 other co-sponsors.  Senator Barrasso delivered the following remarks at today's Senate EPW Committee mark up of S. 1140:  ""Thank you very much Mr. Chairman. I do appreciate you holding a markup on this bipartisan, pro-environmental protection, pro-small business legislation.  ""S. 1140, the Federal Water Quality Protection Act, is legislation I introduced with along with Democrat Senators--Senator Donnelly, Senator Heitkamp, Senator Manchin, along with other members of this committee, including you Mr. Chairman.  ""This is legislation that will protect our nation's navigable waterways and the streams and wetlands that help keep our navigable waters clean.  ""This bill is a testament to the hard work that both sides of the aisle have done in achieving an agreement on an environmental protection bill.  ""Our rivers, our lakes, our wetlands and other waterways are among America's most treasured resources.  ""In my own home state of Wyoming we have some of the most beautiful rivers in the world - the Snake River, the Wind River, dozens of others.  ""The people of Wyoming are devoted to keep these waterways safe and pristine for their children and grandchildren.  ""They understand that there is a right way and a wrong way to do this.  ""It is possible to have reasonable regulations to help preserve our waterways, while still respecting the difference between state waters and federal waters.  ""Now unfortunately, the rule that the EPA has released does not do that. In fact, the rule is actually worse than the proposed rule.  ""Now this is important, because many of my colleagues have been waiting for the rule to be released and gave the administration the benefit of the doubt.  ""But I am here to tell you, that no matter what concessions EPA has claimed, they added new provisions that greatly expand their authority.  ""For example, instead of clarifying the difference between a stream and erosion of the land, the rule defines tributaries to include any place--any place where EPA thinks it sees, believe this, an 'ordinary high water mark.'  ""Well what looks like--not what it is--but the EPA says what it looks like a 'high water mark.'  ""Even worse, EPA proposes to make these decisions from their desks, using aerial photographs and laser generated images - claiming a field visit isn't necessary.  ""Under the rule, the Environmental Protection Agency also has the power to regulate something as 'waters of the United States' if it falls within a 100-year floodplain or if it is within *400 feet of a navigable water or a tributary, and EPA claims that there is a 'significant nexus.'  ""So under this rule, 'significant nexus' can mean a water feature that provides 'life cycle dependent aquatic habitat' for a species.  ""Well if you start drawing 4,000 foot circles around everything that the EPA identifies as a tributary, and everywhere there is potential aquatic habitat for birds and fish in that area, I expect nearly the whole country would be included--the whole country.  ""And Mr. Chairman, this isn't just me. This is from the economic analysis of the EPA Army Clean Water Rule, May 2015 this year. This is what the EPA says, confirm my suspicions, 'The agencies have determined that the vast majority of the nation's water,' not the state's water, not the county's water, not the local water, but the nation's water they think they own it all, 'the nation's water features are located within 4,000 feet of a covered tributary, traditional navigable water, interstate water, or territorial sea. We believe therefore, that very few waters will be located outside 4,000 feet and within a 100-year floodplain.'  ""They believe they can control it all.  ""In addition, the final rule exempts puddles, and they define that as - 'very small, shallow, and highly transitory pool of water that forms on pavements,' oh that's good, 'or uplands during or immediately after a rainstorm or similar precipitation event.'  ""But it does specifically include other pools of water created by rain, such as prairie potholes, vernal pools even if the land where these pools of water form is far away from any navigable water, or even a tributary.  ""Since the Supreme Court issued its 2001 decision in the SWANCC case, none of these isolated pools of water have been found to be jurisdictional, applying a case-by-case analysis.  ""Under this new regulation, nearly all of them will be considered 'waters of the United States,' giving the Environmental Protection Agency the power to regulate what you do on that land.  ""These provisions are sweeping, and will create uncertainty in communities across America.  ""Rather than support an EPA rule that is actually worse than the proposed rule, that does not represent the interests of our farmers, ranchers, families, communities, let's move forward with this bipartisan Federal Water Quality Protection Act to assure the public that we hear and we understand their concerns.  ""At the same time, let's give EPA and the Army Corps the certainty that they need to confidently move forward with a new rule that truly reflects the needs of the constituents that we represent.

576,944989,"With larger spaces scarce in hot markets, some homeowners are finding creative ways to buy their neighbors' properties, using persistence, charm and detective work to expand their empires without leaving the block.  “Our neighbors laugh and say ‘what were you trying to do—play Monopoly?',"" said Alexa Hampton, a 44-year-old interior designer who, with her husband, successfully purchased two apartments adjacent to their unit to create a roughly 3,500-square-foot spread.  The convenience of buying the property next door doesn't come cheap. Purchasers can expect to pay at least 10% above the market rate—and sometimes much more, real-estate agents said. Premiums are especially high in hot property markets like New York City and Los Angeles, where space is hard to come by.  In December, actress and writer Tina Fey paid $9.51 million—roughly $2 million over the asking price—for the apartment above hers on New York's Upper West Side. Last year, film producer Megan Ellison, daughter of software billionaire Larry Ellison, plunked down $5.25 million for the house next to her $30 million estate in the Hollywood Hills. And in 2014 nighttime talk show host Jimmy Fallon bought a fifth apartment in his New York City building, where he bought his first unit in 2002.  The chase can take years. Mr. Solomon, a 31-year-old agent at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, and his husband longed to buy their neighbors' unit, which shared their view of Long Island City's Pepsi-Cola sign. But the neighbors, a couple with a small child, rebuffed Mr. Solomon's offer to buy it.  Then, about a year later, the neighbors turned the tables, offering to buy Mr. Solomon's apartment. He countered, and eventually bought the neighbor's apartment for $915,000, a price he thinks is about $15,000 over market value. After combining the units, he lives in a 1,900-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms, 2½ bathrooms, a den and a laundry room. Best of all, he said, “every room has the same view.""  Jeff Thomas also had to be patient. In 2012 Mr. Thomas, a real-estate developer and owner of car dealerships, bought a 4,000-square-foot house with views in Los Angeles's Hollywood Hills for $4.25 million with real-estate agent Paul Blair of the Agency. Mr. Thomas wanted to expand, but found that local laws wouldn't let him unless he had more land.  About six months after he moved in, the house next door came on the market. Mr. Thomas put in an offer, but the property sold to a higher bidder for $2.25 million. About two years later, Mr. Thomas approached the owners through a friend and asked them to name their price, then quickly agreed to their ask of $2.7 million.  Throughout, Mr. Thomas, 50, kept his identity as their neighbor hidden. “If they feel they have a captive buyer, who really wants or really needs this property, it's just human nature to try to get as much as they can out of this guy,"" he said. He now plans to demolish both homes and build a 17,350-square-foot house with four bedrooms plus staff quarters, an infinity pool and a roof deck with views. The new home would likely be worth $20 million to $30 million, according to Mr. Blair.  Sometimes convincing neighbors to sell requires finding them a new home. “People get very creative for a little extra square footage,"" said real-estate agent Nada Rizk of Brown Harris Stevens.  Royce Pinkwater, founder of the real-estate investment brokerage company Pinkwater Select, described one Manhattan combination she orchestrated last spring as “the most complicated deal I've ever done in my career."" For clients who wanted to expand their three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment, she hired an investigator to find the contact information for the owners of the two-bedroom apartment directly below theirs. To convince the neighbors, an elderly couple, to sell, she had to find them another apartment in the building and offer them $6.5 million, about 20% over market, for their unit. Then after the closing, her clients had to wait months for the couple to renovate their new apartment before moving out.  After all that, Ms. Pinkwater's clients changed their minds, and both units are now on the market for a total of $19.25 million.  Ms. Cornell-McKenna, 49, founder of the lifestyle brand Young Fabulous & Broke, purchased her Hollywood Hills house, with a view of Century City and the ocean, in 2007. Almost right away she started fantasizing about buying the house next door, with which she shared a driveway, for her mother. “I had a vision of a compound,"" said Ms. Cornell-McKenna, who at the time was a single mother. About five years ago, she started saving money to purchase the house, creating an LLC called “1423 Devlin Drive,"" after the property's address.  Then her neighbor—a woman in her 90s who Ms. Cornell-McKenna had befriended—looked into getting a reverse mortgage on the home to help pay her expenses, but couldn't get one. In 2012, with advice from Douglas Elliman agent Tracy Tutor Maltas, Ms. Cornell-McKenna signed an agreement to buy the house for $2 million, with the understanding that the deal wouldn't close until the owner died. Meanwhile, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would pay the neighbor $8,000 a month. The payments would be subtracted from the home's price, and when the neighbor died, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would have 60 days to close.  The arrangement was “a risk,"" Ms. Cornell-McKenna said, because she wasn't sure how long the neighbor would live or if she'd have enough money saved when it came time to close. It ended up working out: The neighbor lived for two years before dying at age 100, during which time “my company did better and better,"" Ms. Cornell-McKenna said. She closed on the home in February of 2015.  Real-estate agents caution that bigger isn't always better. Before making plans to combine two properties, buyers should make sure the combination won't create an awkward layout, which can hurt the home's value, said Ms. Pinkwater. “There are combinations that happen that should never have happened,"" she said. “It has to make sense.""  If it works, a combination can provide better value, especially in markets where real-estate values have appreciated rapidly. When Stacy Rauen, 37, editor of Hospitality Design magazine and founder of the prenatal beverage Bump Water, found out she was pregnant with twins in the spring of 2014, she was living in a two-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with her husband and their toddler son. With one new baby, “we could have made it work,"" she said. “But not with two of them.""  They started looking around for larger apartments and were disappointed with the options. “To get a three or four-bedroom, we were kind of priced out of what we wanted,"" she said.  The apartment upstairs seemed like the solution—it was on the market and had the same layout as theirs for an easy combination. But by the time the Rauens found out about the twins, it had gone into contract. So they made an offer on a three-bedroom in another building, which was accepted.

Every month for years, Heidi Cornell-McKenna paid $8,000 to her elderly neighbor in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles. In exchange, she earned the right to buy the woman's house when she died. Her neighbor died at age 100, and Ms. Cornell-McKenna closed on the house last February.

Adam Solomon and his husband “did a dance for a solid two years"" with their next-door neighbors in Manhattan, with each couple hoping to buy the other out. Mr. Solomon said the Long Island City skyline view from their combined apartments was worth the roughly $15,000 over market value he paid for the place next door.
With larger spaces scarce in hot markets, some homeowners are finding creative ways to buy their neighbors' properties, using persistence, charm and detective work to expand their empires without leaving the block.  “Our neighbors laugh and say ‘what were you trying to do—play Monopoly?',"" said Alexa Hampton, a 44-year-old interior designer who, with her husband, successfully purchased two apartments adjacent to their unit to create a roughly 3,500-square-foot spread.  The convenience of buying the property next door doesn't come cheap. Purchasers can expect to pay at least 10% above the market rate—and sometimes much more, real-estate agents said. Premiums are especially high in hot property markets like New York City and Los Angeles, where space is hard to come by.  In December, actress and writer Tina Fey paid $9.51 million—roughly $2 million over the asking price—for the apartment above hers on New York's Upper West Side. Last year, film producer Megan Ellison, daughter of software billionaire Larry Ellison, plunked down $5.25 million for the house next to her $30 million estate in the Hollywood Hills. And in 2014 nighttime talk show host Jimmy Fallon bought a fifth apartment in his New York City building, where he bought his first unit in 2002.  The chase can take years. Mr. Solomon, a 31-year-old agent at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, and his husband longed to buy their neighbors' unit, which shared their view of Long Island City's Pepsi-Cola sign. But the neighbors, a couple with a small child, rebuffed Mr. Solomon's offer to buy it.  Then, about a year later, the neighbors turned the tables, offering to buy Mr. Solomon's apartment. He countered, and eventually bought the neighbor's apartment for $915,000, a price he thinks is about $15,000 over market value. After combining the units, he lives in a 1,900-square-foot apartment with two bedrooms, 2½ bathrooms, a den and a laundry room. Best of all, he said, “every room has the same view.""  Jeff Thomas also had to be patient. In 2012 Mr. Thomas, a real-estate developer and owner of car dealerships, bought a 4,000-square-foot house with views in Los Angeles's Hollywood Hills for $4.25 million with real-estate agent Paul Blair of the Agency. Mr. Thomas wanted to expand, but found that local laws wouldn't let him unless he had more land.  About six months after he moved in, the house next door came on the market. Mr. Thomas put in an offer, but the property sold to a higher bidder for $2.25 million. About two years later, Mr. Thomas approached the owners through a friend and asked them to name their price, then quickly agreed to their ask of $2.7 million.  Throughout, Mr. Thomas, 50, kept his identity as their neighbor hidden. “If they feel they have a captive buyer, who really wants or really needs this property, it's just human nature to try to get as much as they can out of this guy,"" he said. He now plans to demolish both homes and build a 17,350-square-foot house with four bedrooms plus staff quarters, an infinity pool and a roof deck with views. The new home would likely be worth $20 million to $30 million, according to Mr. Blair.  Sometimes convincing neighbors to sell requires finding them a new home. “People get very creative for a little extra square footage,"" said real-estate agent Nada Rizk of Brown Harris Stevens.  Royce Pinkwater, founder of the real-estate investment brokerage company Pinkwater Select, described one Manhattan combination she orchestrated last spring as “the most complicated deal I've ever done in my career."" For clients who wanted to expand their three-bedroom Upper West Side apartment, she hired an investigator to find the contact information for the owners of the two-bedroom apartment directly below theirs. To convince the neighbors, an elderly couple, to sell, she had to find them another apartment in the building and offer them $6.5 million, about 20% over market, for their unit. Then after the closing, her clients had to wait months for the couple to renovate their new apartment before moving out.  After all that, Ms. Pinkwater's clients changed their minds, and both units are now on the market for a total of $19.25 million.  Ms. Cornell-McKenna, 49, founder of the lifestyle brand Young Fabulous & Broke, purchased her Hollywood Hills house, with a view of Century City and the ocean, in 2007. Almost right away she started fantasizing about buying the house next door, with which she shared a driveway, for her mother. “I had a vision of a compound,"" said Ms. Cornell-McKenna, who at the time was a single mother. About five years ago, she started saving money to purchase the house, creating an LLC called “1423 Devlin Drive,"" after the property's address.  Then her neighbor—a woman in her 90s who Ms. Cornell-McKenna had befriended—looked into getting a reverse mortgage on the home to help pay her expenses, but couldn't get one. In 2012, with advice from Douglas Elliman agent Tracy Tutor Maltas, Ms. Cornell-McKenna signed an agreement to buy the house for $2 million, with the understanding that the deal wouldn't close until the owner died. Meanwhile, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would pay the neighbor $8,000 a month. The payments would be subtracted from the home's price, and when the neighbor died, Ms. Cornell-McKenna would have 60 days to close.  The arrangement was “a risk,"" Ms. Cornell-McKenna said, because she wasn't sure how long the neighbor would live or if she'd have enough money saved when it came time to close. It ended up working out: The neighbor lived for two years before dying at age 100, during which time “my company did better and better,"" Ms. Cornell-McKenna said. She closed on the home in February of 2015.  Real-estate agents caution that bigger isn't always better. Before making plans to combine two properties, buyers should make sure the combination won't create an awkward layout, which can hurt the home's value, said Ms. Pinkwater. “There are combinations that happen that should never have happened,"" she said. “It has to make sense.""  If it works, a combination can provide better value, especially in markets where real-estate values have appreciated rapidly. When Stacy Rauen, 37, editor of Hospitality Design magazine and founder of the prenatal beverage Bump Water, found out she was pregnant with twins in the spring of 2014, she was living in a two-bedroom apartment in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with her husband and their toddler son. With one new baby, “we could have made it work,"" she said. “But not with two of them.""  They started looking around for larger apartments and were disappointed with the options. “To get a three or four-bedroom, we were kind of priced out of what we wanted,"" she said.  The apartment upstairs seemed like the solution—it was on the market and had the same layout as theirs for an easy combination. But by the time the Rauens found out about the twins, it had gone into contract. So they made an offer on a three-bedroom in another building, which was accepted.  Then the unit upstairs fell out of contract. Ms. Rauen's husband knocked on the upstairs neighbor's door one Sunday night and offered to buy the apartment for just under the asking price. The neighbors agreed, and the Rauens retracted their offer on the other apartment. They paid $1.645 million for the unit plus a parking spot and private rooftop patio.

One thinker, Rob Zink, director of portfolio strategy at Connecticut fund manager and researcher Bridgewater Associates, has come up with his group's version, called an all-weather portfolio.

At the Conference of Major Superannuation Funds in Hobart during the week, Zink presented a paper to a very interested audience of fund managers, consultants and not a few of the smarter, larger superannuation fund trustees.  His approach, for investors seeking to position a portfolio to cope with a range of economic possibilities, was to undertake an economic diversification of asset classes. Essentially, Bridgewater looked at four scenarios rising or falling economic growth and rising or falling inflation and then selected the asset mixes that its experience showed performed best in each of those cases.  After balancing the risk within each segment and across the four categories, it came up with a final portfolio that looked nothing like the traditional balanced portfolio, mixing equities and bonds and defensive assets.  Part of the process was to standardise all the asset-class risk-adjusted returns to the level of risk in the S&P500 Index of the US stockmarket. It then sought assets that had a low correlation of returns with each other to provide greater benefits from diversification.  After all this, the all-weather portfolio finished up with a strong bond and fixed-interest bias Bridgewater is essentially a bond and currency manager and one that was quite different to the usual approach of balanced funds.  It was weighted 35 per cent in global inflation-linked bonds, 28 per cent in global nominal bonds and 7 per cent in global shares, all of which were hedged back into the home country currency. The rest of the portfolio was in commodities (6 per cent, via the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index), an investment representing the corporate or mortgage spread over US bonds (22per cent) and another 2 per cent in an emerging market debt spread over US bonds.  Over the past 22 years, that portfolio would have returned 8.8 per cent a year, lower than the 10.3 per cent from the typical balanced portfolio (65per cent in equities and 35 per cent in bonds and defensive assets).  But the risk level was much lower 3.1 per cent against 10.9 per cent in the typical portfolio. As a result, the all-weather portfolio had a much better ratio of return to risk at 0.7 against 0.3per cent.  This meant its worst one-year result in those 22 years was minus 1.4 per cent, while the more typical portfolio lost 33.4 per cent in its worst one-year result. The worst two-year result was minus 38.2 per cent for the normal portfolio, while the all-weather portfolio's worst two years was 6.6 per cent.  But, some investors will complain, that average return of 8.8 per cent is too low. In a normal portfolio, the way to increase returns is to dial up a higher level of riskier assets such as shares or other equities.  The problem in the present climate, however, is that the average expected returns for these asset classes are still less than 10 per cent, which means that this approach simply will not get investors to a target like 10 per cent.  The answer to this, say the Bridgewater people, is to leverage the portfolio; that is, gear up the components in the portfolio to increase the returns. This approach, of course, is guaranteed to turn many conservative investors pale.  Zink says the low risk reading and the good return/risk ratio mean that gearing up the all-weather portfolio does not produce the sort of volatility levels that might be expected.  In fact, gearing it by 100 per cent increases the return to 10.9 per cent. But in the process, this only increases the risk to 6.1 per cent (still below the ungeared normal portfolio) and blows out the worst one-year result to minus 7.2 per cent (again, well under the ungeared typical portfolio). Gearing an ordinary portfolio would send the worst one-year result to minus 60 per cent.  There is no doubt that Bridgewater's approach is radical and perhaps not everyone's cup of tea.

578,481017," Instead of having to forfeit your vacation days by the end of the year, you may be able to contribute the cash equivalent to your defined contribution plans instead.    Late last year, the IRS approved such an arrangement requested by a local government entity. Although the private letter ruling - which supports an earlier IRS ruling in 1995 - only applies to the specific individuals that requested the opinion, it does provide insight into how the IRS would treat similar situations, said Nicholas Kaster, senior tax analyst on pensions at CCH Inc., a publisher of tax information in Riverwoods, Ill.    In this case, the IRS ruled that because employees did not have the option to receive cash in lieu of unused vacation, the contributions to a qualified plan would not count as wages and, as a result, would be free from federal income taxes and FICA taxes.    What's more, employees could potentially stash away more than the maximum contribution limit (currently $12,000 if under 50 and $14,000 if 50 or older) allowed under most defined contribution plans. The latest ruling stated the rules were applicable to a defined contribution plan with profit-sharing features, which could include 401(k) plans or profit-sharing plans.    But before rushing off to your human resources department to sign up, be aware that the ruling may be difficult to implement at most companies.    In fact, this type of arrangement would work best at plans that cover government employees, collective-bargaining unions, or some churches because they are typically exempt from IRS discrimination tests, said Michael Weddell, retirement consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Southfield, Mich. Such plans are more likely to be found in industries with strong unions, said Weddell, who added that he received a call earlier this week from a client in the airline industry who was interested in implementing this plan for its unionized pilots.    For most of corporate America, however, such an arrangement might be more theoretical at this point, especially since the IRS has tightened up nondiscrimination rules last year. Plans must prove to the IRS each year that they are not disproportionately benefiting highly paid workers at the expense of the rank-and-file.    Typically, a plan that would allow employees to contribute the value of their unused vacation days to their retirement plans would benefit highly paid persons more than lower paid employees, said David Wray, president of Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America. In general, higher-paid people have more vacation days but fewer opportunities to use them. Moreover, the value of their vacation days are worth more.    ""Companies have reviewed this periodically,"" Wray said. ""It doesn't work for nearly all plans...(because) if you permit this program, you throw the plans out of compliance with the discrimination rules.""    For this to work, employers would have to structure the plan so that employees would not have a choice of receiving unused days as cash compensation.    Under the ruling, the IRS deemed the vacation contribution as ""non-elective,"" or a contribution that's made by the employer and can have no cash alternative. In contrast, an ""elective"" contribution occurs when an employee chooses to contribute a percentage of his or her pay into a 401(k) plan, for example, instead of taking cash. Because vacation day payments aren't subject to the same rules that govern elective deferrals, which is how employee 401(k) contributions are characterized, an employees could contribute more than the annual limits.    Besides amending their plans, employers would also have to make sure their vacation pay policy is modified to fit their needs such that employees do not ""underuse their vacation because they'd rather bank that,"" said Weddell of Watson Wyatt.

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Putting off your vacation today may someday help

 Instead of having to forfeit your vacation days by the end of the year, you may be able to contribute the cash equivalent to your defined contribution plans instead.    Late last year, the IRS approved such an arrangement requested by a local government entity. Although the private letter ruling - which supports an earlier IRS ruling in 1995 - only applies to the specific individuals that requested the opinion, it does provide insight into how the IRS would treat similar situations, said Nicholas Kaster, senior tax analyst on pensions at CCH Inc., a publisher of tax information in Riverwoods, Ill.

580,476568,"The governor ordered the creation of a panel to study how to establish the bank and report back within 12 months.  The first reason to suspect that a New Jersey public bank may not be a good idea is that only one other state has one - North Dakota. That utterly rural and remote state created its public bank a century ago because it lacked enough in-state banks to provide loans and services to its farmers. That's hardly the case in New Jersey.  The New Jersey Bankers Association opposes Murphy's plan, in particular worrying that it would be subject to cronyism and political influence.

If they had lots of money, they could use their funds as their own bank, saving on their interest and fee payments while making money by lending to others or providing services.

That's the basic idea behind Gov. Phil Murphy's plan to create a New Jersey publicly run bank. Instead of using commercial banks, the state would hold its own money, place some of it in financial markets for gain, and lend some out to earn interest and help people and businesses who might not qualify for loans from regular banks.",Risks may outweigh potential good of Murphy's public bank; Risks may outweigh potential good of Murphy's public bank,",ccat,gpersf,gcat,",0,"Risks may outweigh potential good of Murphy's public bank; Risks may outweigh potential good of Murphy's public bank
Consumers deposit money in banks to earn interest, borrow from banks by paying interest, and pay various fees for bank services such as checking. If they had lots of money, they could use their funds as their own bank, saving on their interest and fee payments while making money by lending to others or providing services.

Instead of using commercial banks, the state would hold its own money, place some of it in financial markets for gain, and lend some out to earn interest and help people and businesses who might not qualify for loans from regular banks.
The governor ordered the creation of a panel to study how to establish the bank and report back within 12 months.  The first reason to suspect that a New Jersey public bank may not be a good idea is that only one other state has one - North Dakota. That utterly rural and remote state created its public bank a century ago because it lacked enough in-state banks to provide loans and services to its farmers. That's hardly the case in New Jersey.  The New Jersey Bankers Association opposes Murphy's plan, in particular worrying that it would be subject to cronyism and political influence. Its executive vice president, Mike Affuso, said the first requirement of such a bank would be ""to ensure the bank is not subject to political pressures and is not a political animal, and in New Jersey that will be difficult.""

582,765500,"If you're a parent, the reality of these costs might make you squirm. But by getting a breakdown of the expenses ahead of time and planning how much you want to subsidise your children, you'll minimise the shock when they eventually fly the nest, settle in overpriced student halls, and adopt the arm-out palm up ""I need money"" stance.  The overall cost of sending a young adult to university for three years depends on a number of factors:  aï ½ï ½ Where they study (highly ranked universities are the most expensive);  aï ½ï ½ Their accommodation (rent in some regions is higher than others); and  aï ½ï ½ How much their lifestyle costs (will they be eating super noodles?).  Students who started their degree last autumn will graduate with an average debt of GBP53,330, according to data from insurance company LV=. The loan comprises two parts: up to GBP9,000 a year for fees, and a maximum maintenance loan of up to GBP5,500 if they're living away from home outside London, or GBP7,675 if they're living away from home in London.  But if you think the loan will cover all the costs, think again. If your household earnings are less than GBP42,600 you can apply for a bursary, but if you earn more than that, the help stops at the basic maintenance loans.  But the maintenance loan simply isn't enough. The average university student will have just GBP11.15 left in student support to live on after paying for their rent and utility bills, a National Union of Students (NUS) survey revealed earlier this year. Santander research reveals four out of 10 students have a part time job, but if they're in the 60 per cent non working majority, it's likely they'll be asking you for money to cover either their rent or living expenses - adding thousands onto the actual cost of their degree.  Aï ½  Should you let your child get a student loan?  No one wants to let their children start their adult life with a mountain of debt if they can help it. But is student debt really that bad? The politicians claim it isn't anywhere near as toxic for your finances as ""proper debt"". It's true that student loans aren't quite the same as ordinary loans: you don't pay back a penny until your're earning GBP21,000 or more, repayments are capped at 9 per cent of your income, and if you haven't paid it off within 30 years, the remainder of the debt is cancelled.  But don't let this friendly packaging lull you into the idea that this is not real debt. Post 2012 student debt grows at a rate of Retail Price Index inflation (RPI) plus 3 per cent, meaning the longer you don't pay it off, the bigger it becomes. As a result, the government has already admitted half of students will have so much debt their loans will be cancelled after 30 years. So unless your kids are in the top 50 per cent of graduate earners, they can expect to spend the vast majority of their working lives funnelling 9 per cent of their wages into debt repayments if they take out a full loan. That 9 per cent a year is a crucial piece of income they could have used to buy a house or raise a child. And financial advisers say that due to the mounting interest on unpaid post 2012 student loans, it makes most financial sense for graduates to prioritise paying it off above saving money or buying a house.  If you can afford to support your children through university but you're not sure of the best way to go about it, here's some ideas on how to do it.  Aï ½  Give them a lump sum before they go to university  A lump sum could be put towards living costs, used for tuition fees or both. The downside here is that if your child knows they're being subsidised they might be likely to spend more frivolously, and the money has to go in their name unless you put it in a trust, which can be very expensive. You need to ask yourself if you can really trust your 18-year old with a lump sum? If not, Lucy Brennan, partner at Saffrey Champness, suggests paying your child's tuition fees upfront. Another perk with this is that it counts as upkeep of the family rather than a gift. Doing this exempts it from tax, unlike gifts worth more than GBP3,000 which are taxable if you die within seven years of you giving them, so this could be a good move if you have a lump sum to give.  But on the other hand, being upfront with your children about how you're going to help them can be a positive step. 17-year-old A-level student, Beatrice Locke, is hoping to get a place at the London School of Economics next year, one of the most expensive universities in the UK. But because she has already sat down with her parents to talk about how they can help her, she knows where she stands and is planning to get a part time job alongside her studies to help fund her tuition fees.  Aï ½  Give them a lump sum when they've graduated  Another option is to let them get the full student loan and then pay some or all of it off when they finally graduate. This option also gives you a few more years to save or invest to raise the funds. If you wait there's also the option of not telling them you're going to help, which will probably make them think twice before spending half their student loan by the end of fresher's week. But if you're waiting to give a lump sum as a gift, remember you have to live seven years after you give a gift worth over GBP3,000 in any one year until it is free from inheritance tax.  Aï ½  A loan from the bank of Mum & Dad  If you don't like the thought of your children being in debt to the Student Loans Company you could think about loaning them the money instead. You can set up this arrangement on a trust basis or have an agreement legally drawn up for an initial fee of around GBP500 to GBP1,000. But Patrick Connolly, financial planner at Chase de Vere, says both options are ""fraught with danger. Most people don't bother with a legal agreement because of the offence it can cause within the family if kids don't feel like their parents trust them. But on the other hand, if you loan your kids GBP50,000 and they are unable or unwilling to pay it back, there's not much you can do if there's no legal paperwork"".  Aï ½  Giving them regular income  Because maintenance loans don't cover rent and living costs it's common for parents to give children money every month for everyday living costs. This option allows you more control over your children's budget, but you need to watch out for your salary falling behind the rental market and living costs.

Almost 60 per cent of people die without a will and many others use a ""do-it-yourself"" job or grab the first free offer they find.    Badly constructed clauses in DIY will kits can lead to confusion.    For example, in your will you state ""I give the contents of my home to . . . ""    Does this include the car or cars in the garage?    Does a bequest to children include step-children?    Is a bequest to sons and daughters in equal shares mean all children are to share equally, or that the sons receive 50 per cent and the daughters 50 per cent?    Does a bequest to grandchildren include only those who are alive at the date of your death?    Take care with assets such as property and shares, because the introduction of capital gains tax, and the propensity to divorce and re-marry, have added complications.    You may own two investment properties of equal value but, if one is pre-CGT, and the other is post-CGT, the beneficiaries may not receive legacies of equal value.    If some properties are mortgaged and some are debt-free, your will needs to spell out whether the beneficiaries must take the properties subject to the existing mortgages or whether the loans are to be paid off by the estate before properties are transferred.    Estate planning can save costly problems later.    Make sure you involve your solicitor, accountant and financial adviser in you will.    * Noel Whittaker is a director and proper authority holder for Whittaker Macnaught Pty Ltd licensed securities dealer.

named president and chief executive officer of this telecommunications
concern, succeeding William W. Becker, 66. Mr. Becker will remain
chairman ""for the time being,"" a spokesman said. The company had said in
April that Mr. Becker planned to turn over day-to-day operations once a
replacement was found. Mr. Bryan was a founder of Millicom International
Cellular SA and was president and chief executive of the cellular
concern from 1985 to 1994. For the six months ended March 31, Intelcom
had a net loss of $23 million on revenue of $50.6 million. The company
attributed part of the loss to a subsidiary withdrawing bids or invoices

590,449204,"""We are monitoring it now because it may be amended,"" said Jim Winchester, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Producers of New Mexico, ""but conceptually, we supported it as it was passed by the House.""  A few provisions of the bill, sponsored by Reps. Nathan Small (D-District 36) and Rod Montoya (R-District 1), include the invalidation of any contract after July 1 that prohibits the use of produced water by oil-and-gas well operators and the clarification of which state agencies have jurisdiction over produced water on various sites.  The current version of the bill gives the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department authority over produced water on oil and gas sites, while the New Mexico Environment Department would regulate produced water used in other industries or for other purposes.  Winchester estimated that 40 percent of southeastern New Mexico oil and gas operators already use produced water, but he said the House bill creates clear ""pathways"" regarding the use and ownership of produced water and likely would encourage more facilities to be developed to distribute or recycle produced water.  Matthew Gonzales, government affairs director for the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, said the group, as well as some related agricultural and conservation groups he has talked with, supported the House version of the bill because it would provide more fresh water to agricultural producers.  ""We see it as an opportunity, one, to clean up produced water in that area, which we see as being a benefit to the state,"" he said. ""A lot of our ranchers and farmers rely on fresh water to put on their crops, so if you have these oil and gas companies that are using more of the produced water, that will free up more of the fresh water for crops.""  He added that at some point in the future, if technology and infrastructure regarding produced water improves, then agricultural lands might be able to use the water for farming and ranching purposes, something he said is not possible now due to both lack of pipelines or storage and distribution facilities and because treatment of the water has not reached the point where produced water is a viable option for agriculture in New Mexico.  Both the Energy Department and the Environment Department reported to the Legislative Finance Committee that the bill would create considerably more demands on their agencies, with more employees or budgetary resources needed in coming years if the bill passes. However, the Fiscal Impact Report produced by the Legislative Finance Committee did not quantify what the state budget implications might be.  A couple of other bills also have been introduced in the Senate, although they have not yet reached the Senate floor by press time, that would give the state Environment Department authority over most aspects of produced water.  Senior Writer Lisa Dunlap can be reached at 575-622-7710, ext. 311, or at reporter02@rdrnews.com.","A state bill that will make it easier for oil and gas companies to use ""produced,"" or recycled, water for their operations won the unanimous approval of the House of Representatives Friday and has a few days to be considered by the New Mexico Senate before the 2019 session closes.

A state bill that will make it easier for oil and gas companies to use ""produced,"" or recycled, water for their operations won the unanimous approval of the House of Representatives Friday and has a few days to be considered by the New Mexico Senate before the 2019 session closes.

The ""Produced Water Act"" is being watched closely by oil and gas producers and agricultural industry members as the Senate Judiciary Committee considers amendments. This year's session ends Saturday afternoon.
""We are monitoring it now because it may be amended,"" said Jim Winchester, executive director of the Independent Petroleum Producers of New Mexico, ""but conceptually, we supported it as it was passed by the House.""  A few provisions of the bill, sponsored by Reps. Nathan Small (D-District 36) and Rod Montoya (R-District 1), include the invalidation of any contract after July 1 that prohibits the use of produced water by oil-and-gas well operators and the clarification of which state agencies have jurisdiction over produced water on various sites.  The current version of the bill gives the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department authority over produced water on oil and gas sites, while the New Mexico Environment Department would regulate produced water used in other industries or for other purposes.  Winchester estimated that 40 percent of southeastern New Mexico oil and gas operators already use produced water, but he said the House bill creates clear ""pathways"" regarding the use and ownership of produced water and likely would encourage more facilities to be developed to distribute or recycle produced water.  Matthew Gonzales, government affairs director for the New Mexico Farm and Livestock Bureau, said the group, as well as some related agricultural and conservation groups he has talked with, supported the House version of the bill because it would provide more fresh water to agricultural producers.  ""We see it as an opportunity, one, to clean up produced water in that area, which we see as being a benefit to the state,"" he said. ""A lot of our ranchers and farmers rely on fresh water to put on their crops, so if you have these oil and gas companies that are using more of the produced water, that will free up more of the fresh water for crops.""  He added that at some point in the future, if technology and infrastructure regarding produced water improves, then agricultural lands might be able to use the water for farming and ranching purposes, something he said is not possible now due to both lack of pipelines or storage and distribution facilities and because treatment of the water has not reached the point where produced water is a viable option for agriculture in New Mexico.  Both the Energy Department and the Environment Department reported to the Legislative Finance Committee that the bill would create considerably more demands on their agencies, with more employees or budgetary resources needed in coming years if the bill passes. However, the Fiscal Impact Report produced by the Legislative Finance Committee did not quantify what the state budget implications might be.  A couple of other bills also have been introduced in the Senate, although they have not yet reached the Senate floor by press time, that would give the state Environment Department authority over most aspects of produced water.

That is the premise of Rich Uncles NNN REIT Inc., a startup trying to capture a piece of the $110 billion nontraded real-estate investment trust business.  The Costa Mesa, Calif., company is rolling out a new type of nontraded REIT that bypasses brokers and appeals directly to small investors via radio and other advertising.  Its pitch: the potential for big returns in commercial real estate with initial investments of as little as $500.  The new REIT comes at a time when some of the nation's biggest property landlords are experimenting with new business models after regulators overhauled the rules governing what they must disclose to investors.  Purveyors of nontraded REITs, which control office buildings, shopping malls and apartment buildings around the U.S., have been criticized for high brokerage fees and poor disclosures to small investors. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority in April toughened the rules on nontraded REITs, making them disclose the brokerage fees upfront and report the value of customers' investments in regular statements, typically quarterly.  Before the move, nontraded REITs on average charged 11% in fees and commissions. That means only $8,900 of a $10,000 investment went toward properties. And because fee disclosures weren't mandatory, it took some investors years to find out how much they had actually paid.  Now some firms are tinkering with ways to keep charging the fees despite the new rules, said Kevin Shields, chief executive officer of investment and asset management firm Griffin Capital Corp. For example, the industry is rolling out new fund share types called T-shares that stretch out the fees over time, Mr. Shields said.  The new models come at a time when commercial property prices are lofty and some analysts warn a seven-year bull run might be nearing its end. Small investors could get slammed if the market turns south.

Nontraded REITs sell shares to investors and use the proceeds to purchase property. The funds usually pay dividends, and investors stand to profit later, when the managers sell the properties. Nontraded REITs aren't listed on public exchanges and usually are sold through brokers, and the fees aren't always disclosed in an easy way for investors to understand, even after the rule changes.  One response to the new rules is to appeal directly to investors to cut down on the broker fees.

At a presentation for investors recently in Costa Mesa, Howard Makler, the company's co-founder, said Rich Uncles' technology platform allows people to invest in commercial real estate without middlemen. This means roughly 10% more of the investment amount is actually invested in real estate, he said. The minimum investment amount is $500, less than the typical $1,000 required by most nontraded REITs.  ""You've heard of Uber and you've heard of Airbnb.

593,1347287,"- While the Affordable Care Act is no longer new, each year brings changes to the health care law. As you undoubtedly know, the ACA is inextricably linked to taxes so keeping up with annual changes is important. Given tax season is now well underway, here’s what you need to know when preparing your income tax return this season.  ACA paperwork: things to know before you file  Beginning each January, a variety of tax documents are sent your way. Some arrive via snail mail and others appear in your email inbox. And while you’ve probably come to know the most common, like 1040, W-2 and maybe even Form 1099, this tax season you may receive forms you haven’t seen before: 1095-B and 1095-C (Not to be confused with Form 1095-A, which was required last year).  “These new forms are creating a bit of confusion for taxpayers this year. Folks simply aren’t clear about what they’re supposed to do with Forms 1095 when they receive them,” says Andrew Townsend, tax analyst for TaxAct, a leading provider of affordable digital and download tax preparation solutions. “The important thing to know is that, in most cases, you do not need to wait until you receive these forms to file your tax return. Simply check a box on your return to indicate you had minimum essential coverage throughout the year.  “You don’t even have to worry about attaching 1095 forms to your return — the IRS receives a separate copy. Just put your form(s) in a safe place in case you need to verify any information later.”  A little background  In 2014, the IRS released Forms 1095-B and 1095-C as optional paperwork for employers and insurance providers. For tax year 2015, it became a requirement for every business and insurance provider to administer the forms to the IRS and the corresponding individual or employee as proof of provided coverage.  Here’s what you need to know about the three versions of Form 1095:  * Form 1095-A — if you purchased health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace in 2015, you can expect to receive Form 1095-A. When preparing your 2015 federal return, you will need to use this information to complete your income tax filing, claim premium tax credits and adjust any tax credit payments.  * Form 1095-B — your insurance company will send you this form if you received minimum essential health coverage through an employer, the government or a government-run plan such as Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, TRICARE, VA benefits, etc.  * Form 1095-C — this form will come directly from your employer if it offered coverage to you through a company-sponsored health care plan.  No matter which 1095 form you get, the purpose is the same: to provide an accurate picture of the health insurance coverage you had access to throughout the past year. However, the information provided on Form 1095-B and 1095-C varies slightly.  Form 1095-B includes details specific to your selected health insurance plan, such as the name of your health insurance provider, who the plan covered and the period during which your family had health insurance.  Form 1095-C lists the coverage options you were offered through a company-sponsored health care plan. Even if you chose not to participate in your company-sponsored plan, you will still receive Form 1095-C as proof of the options made available to you.  Keep an eye out for these forms, which should be sent to you on or before March 31, 2016.  Steeper penalties for the uninsured  The ACA says that most Americans living in the United States are required to have qualified health insurance coverage.  “The good news is many people already meet minimum essential coverage requirements,” Townsend says. “However, those who didn’t have health insurance for more than two months in 2015 and did not qualify for an exemption may face a tax penalty for each month they went without coverage.”  This penalty, known as an individual shared responsibility payment, is not new this year, but the amount a taxpayer without qualifying insurance may be subject to pay with their 2015 tax return has changed.  The penalty, payable with 2015 returns (due April 18, 2016), is the greater of:  * 2 percent of your yearly household income above the tax-filing threshold (generally about $10,300) up to a maximum cost of the national average premium to purchase a Bronze Plan from the federal healthcare exchange (also called a Marketplace)  * $325 per adult ($162.50 per child under 18), but not more than $975  These costs have more than tripled since 2014 when the penalty was $95 per person or 1 percent of household income.  In 2016 they spike even higher. If you do not meet the minimum essential coverage requirements throughout 2016, you may pay the greater of 2.5 percent of your household income or $695 per adult and $347.50 per child under 18 (up to $2,085 for a family).  Help when you need it  It can be challenging to stay on top of annual changes to the ACA and the related tax implications. Fortunately, taxpayers can turn to a number of resources, including TaxAct, for help.

Motorists will be signposted to special parking bays when they arrive and you then add the bay number to the order when you pay.  The idea is to save diners time waiting around in long drive-thru queues.  When McDonald’s first reopened drive-thrus after coronavirus lockdown, some fans had to wait up to three hours in a queue.  McDonald's car park click and collect  MCDONALD'S has expanded its car park click and collect takeaway service to 21 more restaurants.

There’s been no update on whether it plans on introducing it in more restaurants just yet.  Click and collect from McDonald’s is free, so it won’t cost you extra to order food from your car.

MCDONALD’S has expanded its car park click and collect takeaway service to 24 restaurants.

This includes the three branches that had already been named as part of the initial test run for its “Click. Park. Collect”.
The new car service lets customers make their order on the free McDonald’s app, wait in the car park and then have the food delivered to their window.  Motorists will be signposted to special parking bays when they arrive and you then add the bay number to the order when you pay.  The idea is to save diners time waiting around in long drive-thru queues.  When McDonald’s first reopened drive-thrus after coronavirus lockdown, some fans had to wait up to three hours in a queue.  McDonald's car park click and collect  MCDONALD'S has expanded its car park click and collect takeaway service to 21 more restaurants.  This is on top of the three branches that were already running the new scheme.  Here’s where you can test it out:  * Bawtry Road, Rotherham  * Canklow, Rotherham  * Parkgate, Rotherham  * Doncaster Dome  * Balby, Doncaster  * Centurion Way, Doncaster  * Salford  * Urmston  * Eccles  * Llanelli  * Bristol Hengrove  * Leytonstone DT  * Bristol Longwell Green  * Dover – Whitfield  * Ashford Orbital Park  * Newport Road, Cardiff  * Cardiff Bay Retail, Cardiff  * Culverhouse Cross, Cardiff  * Capitol Shopping, Cardiff  * Yorkshire Grey  * Woolwich 3  First three restaurants taking part in the trial:  * Lytham  * Royston  * Biggleswade  Announcing the initial trial last month, McDonald’s said it could roll the service out nationwide if it proves popular.  There’s been no update on whether it plans on introducing it in more restaurants just yet.  Click and collect from McDonald’s is free, so it won’t cost you extra to order food from your car.

596,791726,"ECUA Chairwoman Lois Benson and board member Dale Perkins voted against the increase.  Bills are expected to increase about 9.5 percent, according to figures provided by ECUA spokeswoman Nathalie Bowers. Benson said documents she received from the ECUA finance office showed the average rate increase could be as much 11 percent.  ""I just thought that was really steep,"" Benson said. ""As much as I want to do infrastructure improvements, I think 11 percent is — for many families in this area who are not participating in the economic comeback — I just thought that was steep.""  The 3 percent rate increase will equate to $2.05 for an average water and sewer customer who consumes 6,000 gallons of water a month.  On top of the rate increase, the capital improvement fee will charge water and sewer customers a flat fee of $5 a month, bringing the total monthly increase to about $7.  The capital improvement fee will raise approximately $40 million to spend on improving the water and sewer system. Money from the fee can only go to improvement projects, Benson said.  The 3 percent rate increase was reasonable, Benson said, but she thought the board could have found money to improve the system without the capital fee increase.  ""Frankly, our capital needs are real,"" Benson said. ""You just have to balance your capital needs with the fact that everybody has to have water and sewer. It's not an option.""  The board was set to vote on the fee increase in July, but failed to satisfy all legal notice requirements of the proposal.  The vote on the rate increase occurred after David Suhor, a religious freedom activist and member to the West Florida Chapter of The Satanic Temple, was removed from the boardroom after trying to pray before the meeting began.","The average Emerald Coast Utilities Authority customer will see their water bill increase by about $7 after the utility voted to raise rates and charge a new capital improvement fee.
