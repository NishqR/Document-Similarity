0,Intervention was the right thing to do,"News Intervention was the right thing to do FINANCE  The Bank of England's extraordinary intervention in the UK Government bond market was absolutely necessary. Despite representing an embarrassing U-turn on its recently announced plans to sell £80bn of gilts into the markets, its emergency purchases helped restore stability to UK financial markets.  The need for temporary giltbuying was catalysed by problems arising in UK pension funds, which hold hundreds of billions of pounds in UK gilts.  Record low gilt yields in recent years meant government bond prices rose sharply, earning pension funds large profits. However, with global inflation and interest rates rising all over the world, bond yields have risen during 2022, resulting in significant capital losses for pension investors. The money received from past profits helped them manage those losses but in recent days the situation dramatically worsened.  The loss of confidence in sterling through September sparked a rushed exit from UK assets, pushing 30-year gilt yields above 4 per cent. The day after International Monetary Fund warnings about the direction of UK economic policy, international investors accelerated sales or shorting of UK gilts, causing yields to crash through 5 per cent.  The sudden collapse in gilt prices led financial companies to demand more cash collateral to cover pension fund losses. A £1bn pension fund was, perhaps, suddenly facing cash calls of over £100m. Instead of the usual one or two weeks to allow time for orderly sales, they demanded the money in one or two days. This created a negative spiral because pension funds had run out of buffers and faced either selling gilts or other assets into the falling markets or risking default.  The Bank of England's remit to protect financial stability, required it to step in and stop the situation spinning out of control, reducing 30-year yields to 4 per cent.  Pension funds have been stabilised but it is important to stress that final-salary scheme members were not going to lose all their pensions. They are protected by the Pension Protection Fund, which insures 80-90 per cent of their promised pension.  Defined contribution pension scheme members, whose pensions depend on their investments, and do not promise a specific pension, may have been more severely affected. These funds often have significant investments in gilts and bonds, supposedly to reduce risk and provide stability, but rising bond yields have caused large losses. There is no insurance or employer to underpin these pensions and further bond market crises would mean even lower pensions for members.  The Bank of England's intervention is only a temporary measure. More must be done to restore market confidence. If we are to avoid ongoing financial crises, and pension fund damage, Government must restore confidence in UK economic management. This could include lowering taxes on a wider tax base, boosting private investment, or cutting spending, instead of further unfunded tax cuts.

1,SIX STATES FILE A CHALLENGE TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION PROGRAM,"SIX STATES FILE A CHALLENGE TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION PROGRAM LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 29 -- The Nebraska attorney general issued the following news release:  Today, six states filed a challenge to the Biden Administration's student loan cancellation program in federal court in Missouri. In it, they ask the Court for an immediate temporary restraining order pausing the program. Prompt relief is being sought because the Biden Administration has indicated it will start cancelling loan balances as early as next week.  Just a few months ago, the Supreme Court warned federal agencies against ""asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted"" by statute. Yet the Biden Administration's recently announced student loan cancellation program-the Mass Debt Cancellation-does precisely that.  Determined to pursue across-the-board debt cancellation and stymied by repeated failures to achieve that goal through legislation, the Administration resorted to the now-concluded COVID-19 pandemic and a federal law that applies in the context of military operations or national emergencies as its justification for taking this dramatic action.  In addition to being economically unwise and inherently unfair, the Biden Administration's Mass Debt Cancellation is another example in a long line of unlawful regulatory actions. No statute permits President Biden to unilaterally relieve millions of individuals from their obligation to pay loans they voluntarily assumed.  This burden of economic loss will do little to benefit the working class and the poor. The majority of the Mass Debt Cancellation will accrue to the debt borrowers in the top 60 percent of the income distribution. It is fundamentally unfair for those who can least afford it to provide through their tax dollars relief to the well-off who can afford to pay their own loans.  The law that the Biden Administration relies on is known as the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act). But it has never been used to do anything like this before. It is inconceivable that when Congress passed the HEROES Act, it thought it was authorizing the President to unilaterally decree something like the Mass Debt Cancellation, which will result in around half a trillion dollars in losses to the federal treasury.  The Mass Debt Cancellation is not remotely tailored to address the effects of the pandemic on federal student loan borrowers, as required by the HEROES Act. The Cancellation instead disregards the Act's objectives and express requirements and distorts the Act beyond recognition in the service of the Administration's political agenda on student loans. It is unlawful and arbitrary agency action, and it should be immediately set aside.  No borrower will be disadvantaged by an immediate court order delaying the loan cancellation program because loan repayments and interest accruals have been paused since March 2020.  States joining in the filing include: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina.

2,"Senator Reverend Warnock Introduces Bill to Ensure Georgia Car Buyers, Automakers Fully Benefit from Cost-Cutting Tax Credits","Senator Reverend Warnock Introduces Bill to Ensure Georgia Car Buyers, Automakers Fully Benefit from Cost-Cutting Tax Credits; Today, Senator Reverend Warnock introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act which would create a phase-in period for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-GA) News Release Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act which would create a phase-in for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act will ensure Georgians may immediately and fully benefit from the cost-cutting and job-creating provisions of the IRA, including tax credits that will lower the costs of electric vehicles.  ""I'm focused squarely on helping Georgia car buyers save money and helping car manufacturers who do business in our state thrive. The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Actwill lower costs for Georgians and provide consumers more options when purchasing an electric vehicle, while also supporting good-paying jobs across our state and bolstering Georgia automakers like Hyundai. I'm going to do everything I can to get this bill over the finish line,"" said Senator Reverend Warnock.  The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would delay the IRA's phase-in period for automakers to follow specific sourcing requirements for their EVs in order for car buyers to qualify for the federal tax credit. These requirements include: requiring the EVs to be manufactured in North America; requiring EV batteries to be made domestically; and mandating that critical minerals used in battery production are only sourced domestically or from nations with whom America has a free trade agreement. Georgia automakers need additional time to meet these new on-shoring requirements and bring planned domestic EV facilities online, including the forthcoming Hyundai EV facility scheduled to open in 2025 in Bryan County, GA.  Senator Warnock has been a vocal champion for creating green jobs and reducing America's reliance on fossil fuels. Last week, Senator Reverend Warnock pushed the Biden Administration to implement the IRA's EV tax credit provision with ""maximum flexibility"" to ensure Georgia car buyers and manufacturers can fully benefit. In February, Senator Warnock announced that he secured nearly $20 million in funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build out Georgia's EV infrastructure network across the state. Additionally, Senator Warnock has been in frequent contact with Hyundai about the auto manufacturer's footprint and future in Georgia, and has encouraged efforts on the federal level to bolster the company's presence--as well as EV and EV battery manufacturing, in general--in the state.

3,10 Markets Where Sellers Are Cutting Home Prices the Most,"Daily 10 Markets Where Sellers Are Cutting Home Prices the Most Sellers reduced their asking prices on roughly one in five U.S. home listings in September, according to data released today. The price cuts come as higher mortgage rates increase the cost of financing a home purchase, weighing on both buyers and sellers.  The share of listings with price reductions in September was 19.5%, according to Realtor.com's housing report-a 2022 high and up from 11% last September. (Barron's and the company that operates Realtor.com are both owned by News Corp.)  Some metropolitan areas in September saw more frequent reductions than others. Of the 50 largest metropolitan areas, the share of listings with price cuts was greatest in Phoenix; Austin; Las Vegas; Denver; Sacramento, Calif.; Dallas; Tampa, Fla.; Nashville, Tenn.; Portland, Ore.; and Jacksonville, Fla. The share of listings with price reductions in these markets ranged from 44% in Phoenix to 25.7% in Jacksonville.  The latest data illustrates a reset in seller expectations compared with the same month last year. With the exception of Portland, the metropolitan areas listed above also experienced the greatest year-over-year increase in the share of listings with price reductions.  Nationally, homes also took longer to sell, with the typical home spending seven more days on the market this month than during September 2021. Compared with the year prior, days on the market increased most in Raleigh, N.C.; Austin; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Charlotte N.C.; Riverside, Calif.; Denver; Nashville; Orlando, Fla.; and Sacramento.  Despite the uptick in price cuts, the median listing price in September remained higher than year-ago levels in all but two of the large metropolitan areas: Pittsburgh and New Orleans. The median listing price nationally was $427,000, representing a year-over-year increase of 13.9%, Realtor.com said.  The data is the latest to illustrate the housing market's quick shift from the early pandemic's buying frenzy to today's affordability-driven pullback as mortgage rates rise. The average 30-year fixed rate more than doubled this year as the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy to combat inflation, according to weekly Freddie Mac data.  Higher mortgage rates is one reason why the National Association of Realtors earlier this week revised down its existing-home sale and price expectations for 2023. The trade group expects sales to slump to their slowest annual rate since 2012 next year, and foresees annual price growth of 1.2%.  Amid the gloomy news is a potential bright spot for prospective buyers: the slower market could result in more wiggle room for those previously pushed to the sidelines by competition earlier in the pandemic. ""For prospective buyers grappling with affordability, you may have more bargaining power than you realize, particularly in areas where time on market is rising,"" Danielle Hale, chief economist of Realtor.com, said.

4,"Biden touts Inflation Reduction Act, critics say student loan cancellation offsets gains","Biden touts Inflation Reduction Act, critics say student loan cancellation offsets gains Missouri Western State College ; St Joseph, MO - news  By  (The Center Square) - President Joe Biden touted the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act during a speech Tuesday, but analysts point to the recent student debt cancellation as an ""offset"" of any reduced inflation and federal debt reduction.  Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, praised spending items in the bill, pointing to deficit reductions in the legislation and overall since the COVID-era spike in relief spending.  ""So I don't want to hear it anymore about big-spending Democrats,"" he said. ""We spend, but we pay.""  A recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, found that that the cost to taxpayers to cancel $10,000 to $20,000 per borrower in student debt will more than offset the debt and inflationary benefits of the IRA.  The Congressional Budget Office said that the IRA will cut the deficit by $238 billion over the next decade.  More from this section  AHA News: She Had a Stroke During a Video Call With Her Congressional Representative  How to Start Saving for Your Kids' College  Fewer Pet Neuterings in Pandemic Means Shelters Are Filling Up  But the CRFB estimates Biden's debt cancellation will cost taxpayers more than double that amount, offsetting those gains twofold.  ""The student debt cancellation and relief measures recently announced by the Biden Administration will cost roughly $500 billion over ten years under our estimates, wiping out the $238 billion of ten-year deficit reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act more than two times over,"" the group said. ""In total, we estimate the student debt proposals will cost as much as the first 16 years of IRA deficit reduction on a nominal basis and the first 21 years of deficit reduction on a present value basis.""  The group goes on to say its analysis is likely ""generous"" in the Biden administration's favor.  ""Our estimates may prove overly generous, as they are based on our central estimate, do not incorporate a likely uptick in loans as a result of the new policies, and assume smooth implementation of the IRA,"" the CRFB said. ""Under our higher-end estimate of the student loan plan, it will consume roughly 18 years of IRA savings on a nominal basis and roughly 25 years on a present value basis. If expiring Affordable Care Act subsidy expansions were extended without offsets in the IRA, the student loan plan might consume over 25 years of the savings on a nominal basis, and it is not clear whether such a plan would ever generate enough deficit reduction to finance the student debt cancellation on a present value basis.  ""In addition, as we have pointed out before, the inflationary effects of the new student debt plan will far outweigh any disinflationary effects from the IRA,"" the group added.

6,Students react to Biden's student debt relief plan,"Students react to Biden's student debt relief plan University of Mississippi ; University, MS - news  By Alyssa Conrad  Graphic by Savannah Shook.  Recently, President Joe Biden made good on his promise to forgive student loan debt. In an official statement addressing the student loan relief plan released on Aug. 24, Biden said it will allow people to ""finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt to get on top of their rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.""  Citizens with annual adjusted gross salaries less than $125,000 (or $250,000 per household) will receive $10,000 off their student loan debt. Citizens with qualifying salaries who are also eligible for a Pell Grant will receive an additional $10,000 off their student loans.  In order to qualify, the loans must be federal, not privately issued. Some current students are also eligible for student loan cancellation, based on free application for federal student aid and whether or not they filed as independent or dependent. Student loan forgiveness for independent students will be based on their own incomes, whereas parent incomes will be taken into account for those who filed as dependents.  Like citizens across the country, UM students have mixed feelings about the plan.  ""I think it's dumb because it's not fixing the underlying problem of higher education being too expensive in the first place,"" Mary-Patt Robben, a sophomore public policy major, said.  Robben believes that student loan forgiveness is not the correct way to combat the increasing cost of a college education and only provides a temporary solution for the issue.  But that isn't how everyone feels about the topic of student loan forgiveness. UM senior Jared Holly, a psychology and nursing major, wholeheartedly supports the new plan.  ""I'm all for it. I'll pay the taxes or whatever it takes. I'm not even necessarily one of those students in debt - I'm grateful to have parents who pay for my education, but I think we should cancel out more,"" Holly said.  Preston Kennedy, a sophomore international studies major also supports the plan, but he thinks that the plan does not go far enough.  ""I feel like, if we're going to spend this much, we should just forgive it all,"" Kennedy said. ""It's a step in the right direction, but if we're willing to spend billions of dollars on this, we should just go all the way.""  It is estimated that around 8 million citizens will get their expected debt forgiveness without needing to take any additional action because their current income information is on file with the U.S. Department of Education. For those without up to date income information on file, there will be an online form released where they can claim the debt forgiveness if they qualify for it. This application is expected to be released within the coming months.  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))",1,1,0
7,"A GOP attorney general says people are 'celebrating prematurely' Biden's student-loan forgiveness, suggesting lawsuits are to come","A GOP attorney general says people are 'celebrating prematurely' Biden's student-loan forgiveness, suggesting lawsuits are to come * Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told CNBC student-loan forgiveness is being lauded ""prematurely.""  * He said he is looking for ways to legally challenge Biden's debt relief.  * Other GOP lawmakers like Ted Cruz have also said they are pursuing ways to block the policy.  Another Republican politician voiced intentions to legally challenge President Joe Biden's student-loan forgiveness.  Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovichtold CNBC on Tuesday it might be too soon to bank on Biden's announcement to forgive $10,000 to $20,000 in student-loan debt for federal borrowers making under $125,000 a year. He said Biden is on ""very, very shaky legal grounds right now.""  ""I think there's a lot of people celebrating prematurely,"" Brnovich told CNBC. ""A lot of other people are very upset about this, not only because of legal arguments, but because they believe it's fundamentally unfair.""  The Biden administration said the authority to wipe out that debt is granted under the HEROES Act of 2003, which gives the Education Secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like COVID-19.  But critics of the plan have argued that is an overreach of the authority, and the legal grounds do not exist for the president to cancel that amount of student debt.  Brnovich added that a lawsuit should be filed ""sooner rather than later"" so borrowers do not become to reliant on relief, and he said he's confident he can find a plaintiff that could challenge Biden's actions.  ""If we can bring a challenge, we will bring a challenge,"" Brnovich said.  While there was legal debate prior to Biden's announcement of loan forgiveness, the conversation has only amplified since then. Biden's Education and Justice Departments both released memos concluding the Education Secretary does have the authority to enact one-time blanket relief due to pandemic-caused financial hardship, and they also rescinded a memo from former President Donald Trump saying the authority to cancel student debt broadly does not exist.  Still, Republicans and conservative groups have said they are pursuing legal routes to overturn the policy. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, toldThe Washington Post that he is ""brainstorming"" ways to block debt relief after acknowledging it could be difficult to find a plaintiff. Abby Shafroth, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, also previously told Insider that it will be difficult to prove someone has suffered a concrete injury as a result of Biden's debt cancellation.  For now, it's unclear how any legal action will progress, and the Education Department is continuing to tell federal borrowers to prepare for an application for relief to become live in early October, and they will have until the end of next year to submit their form.

The policy will mean that these deals must be offered to both new and existing customers, as well as stopping loyal customers being penalised for not switching energy suppliers. Since September last year, more than two dozen energy companies have gone bust, having relied on new customers with discounted deals and loss making prices to stay solvent.

9,Couple who bought B&Q plant for just £12 discover its leaves are worth £170 each,"Money Couple who bought B&Q plant for just £12 discover its leaves are worth £170 each Harry Langstaff and Amy Biffa couldn't believe it when they spotted the super rare monstera Aurea marmorata plant had been marked down from £24 to £12 in their local B&Q  A couple are quids in after they purchased a rare plant from B&Q for just £12 -but its leaves are worth £170 each.  Harry Langstaff and Amy Biffa spotted the plant had been marked down from £24 to £12.  The couple believe it had been reduced due to yellow colouring that had appeared on its leaves, which staff could've mistaken for a disease -but this actually means the plant is extremely rare.  Harry and Amy picked up a monstera Aurea marmorata -which can sell for anywhere between £200 for a clipping, to £2,000 for a whole plant.  The amateur botanists said they felt like they were ""winning the lottery"" when they spotted the discount.  It comes after plant collectors urged shoppers to check shops for unusual shrubs in B&Q and Lidl -again, as staff are mistakenly marking down rare species over fears they are sick.  Harry told The Sun : ""When we first saw the plant sitting there, we kind of just looked at each other and really couldn't believe what we were seeing.  ""It was reduced to £12 because it had a yellow leaf that B&Q must have assumed meant it was sick.  ""We hastily checked the stem for any colour, we then immediately just snatched it up and strapped it in the back seat with a seatbelt like it was our child.""  The couple had been searching stores for rare plants for their small business, The Plant Couple.  Harry reckons their plant is worth about £600 at the moment and says they'll sell the leaves at £170 each.  The couple say the plant would need to have elaborate multi-coloured leaves to be worth as much as £2,000.  To check whether your plant is rare or just has one yellow dry leaf, Harry recommends looking at the stem to see if this too is also yellow or white.  If the stem shows signs of striping, then it's variegated -which means showing different colours -and your plant could be worth a small fortune.  Even then, you have to wait until it has grown properly to make sure it isn't just a disease.  Harry says the chances of finding a super rare plant in a local shop can be ""extremely slim, one in a million"".  A B&Q spokesperson said: ""At B&Q we're pretty proud of the quality of our house plants so we can see why it's been reported that our plants could be worth up to £4,000.  ""Whilst we don't sell the extremely rare plants in question, we do sell top quality houseplants that our customers are more familiar with and that are more purse-friendly!""",0,0,0
10,Drivers face £35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue,"News Drivers face £35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue * Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police  * But at present drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty nor vehicle excise duty  * Government urged to have a 'conversation' with drivers on new ways to be taxed  * The report recommends 'road pricing' which would charge drivers per car trip  Drivers will have to pay new taxes to plug the £35billion shortfall created by the switch to electric cars - and ministers must spell out what they are, a report says today.  The Commons transport committee's report urges the Government to start an 'up-front conversation' with drivers about new ways they could be taxed.  At present, drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty, which nets £28billion a year, or vehicle excise duty, which brings in £7billion.  Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police.  Vehicle excise duty is spent fixing roads. To replace them, the report recommends 'road pricing', which would charge drivers per trip, based on the distance travelled, duration of the journey and vehicle type.  It also urges ministers to set up an arms-length body to recommend a new regime by the end of this year.  The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030, so millions of motorists are expected to go electric before then.  A government spokesman said it was committed to keeping the transition to electric cars 'affordable for consumers'.  Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show plug-in vehicles accounted for more than one in six new cars registered in the UK last year.  'The situation is urgent,' the report warned. 'Work must begin without delay.'  Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said the UK faces a '£35 billion black hole in finances unless the Government acts now'.  He went on: 'That's 4% of the entire tax-take. Only £7 billion of this goes back to the roads; schools and hospitals could be impacted if motorists don't continue to pay.  'We need to talk about road pricing.  'Innovative technology could deliver a national road pricing scheme which prices up a journey based on the amount of road, and type of vehicle, used.'  He added: 'Net-zero emissions should not mean zero tax revenue.'  RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the 'silver lining of zero-carbon motoring comes wrapped in a cloud of trouble for the Chancellor'.  He went on: 'Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next - particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change.  'If the Treasury is thinking it can leave this issue for another day but still recoup their losses from electric vehicles they risk a furious backlash from drivers who made the choice to go electric expecting to save money.'",1,1,0
11,Sultan ‘partner’ joins will battle,"Index Sultan 'partner' joins will battle A WOMAN stated to be the de facto partner of late property mogul Ali Sultan has been drawn into a high-profile estate battle with his eldest son.  Moe Sultan is challenging his father's will in an ongoing Supreme Court of Tasmania clash, alleging executors and trustees of his father's most recent will misused money from the estate and appointed themselves directors of Sultan Holdings.  Rola Taychouri-Smith has recently been added as a defendant in the proceedings, with Moe Sultan noting various incarnations of his father's will since November 2018 granted her annual legacies and/or a specific bequest.  Moe Sultan says his father's last true will was made in July 2018 or earlier, and that subsequent versions did not represent his father's intentions and were not valid wills ""as he did not know and approve his contents"" when he executed them.  In her defence filed with the court, Ms Taychouri-Smith says she was the second cousin of Ali Sultan as her paternal grandmother was his maternal grandmother's sister.  But she also said she had been in a romantic relationship with Ali Sultan at the time of his death as his de facto spouse. She said that while Ali Sultan was married to Christine Sultan, their relationship ended in 2014 and they were ""in the final stage of formalising their divorce at the time the deceased died"".  She denied wills made in November 2018, November 2019 and December 2020 were invalid.  Ali Sultan, a well-known businessman, died unexpectedly in January 2021 after a heart attack while walking on kunanyi/Mt Wellington.  Moe Sultan claims his father had limited English skills, particularly in comprehension of written documents, and that newer versions of the will did not reflect his intentions. A number of defendants have already denied claims of wrongdoing in the case, including Integrity Commission chief commissioner Aziz Gregory Melick, Sultan Holdings accountant Mark Saltzman and lawyer Damian Egan.  Moe Sultan's younger brother Saleh, also listed as a defendant, has previously filed a written defence with the court, although the amended statement of claim does not allege any wrongdoing by him.  Two further defendants, Mezed Eid and Mohamad Eid, have now also filed a joint defence with the court, denying claims the later versions of Ali Sultan's will were not valid.  However, they agreed with Moe Sultan's claims that the December 2020 will did not represent Ali Sultan's testamentary intentions.  Two defendants - lawyer Ian Creese and Sultan Holdings project development manager Timothy Lucas - previously rescinded their involvement and are no longer parties to the dispute.  On Wednesday, lawyers for all parties involved appeared in the Supreme Court of Tasmania via video link before Associate Justice Stephen Holt. He ordered all defendants file affidavit material within 21 days, with a further directions hearing to be held on March 9. The matter is slated for mediation, and if it does not resolve will go to trial.",0,1,1

Thousands of Tesco Bank customers will be entitled to a refund after the lender told them theirno claims bonus protectionfor motor insurance would be around £1.2 million cheaper collectively than it actually was.  In writing to 124,451 customers between April 2020 and September last year, theCompetition and Markets Authority(CMA) said that Tesco Bank misled them into thinking their policies would be £10 cheaper than reality.

""Thanks to our action, Tesco customers will now have the chance to decide whether they want to keep their current protection or get their money back.""  Top Money Stories Today  It said that Tesco Bank had failed to ""clearly, prominently and accurately"" displace the additional cost of a no claims bonus protection.  This meant that customers did not understand the value in removing the protection from their deal.  Tesco Bank reported the problems to the CMA itself.  The bank said: ""We apologise for this error, which we have now fixed.  ""All existing customers who were impacted have been contacted with the option of a refund and the removal of their no claims bonus protection.

Hickenlooper (D-CO) News Release Denver, Colo.-Today, Senator John Hickenlooper applauded Connect for Health Colorado's announcement that 198,412 Coloradans signed up for a health insurance plan by the end of the most recent Open Enrollment Period. This marks an increase of more than 18,000 enrollments, or 10 percent, above last year's end of Open Enrollment total, and is the highest end of Open Enrollment total since Connect for Health Colorado opened in 2013.  Three out of four customers who signed up for a plan qualified for health insurance savings via premium subsidies passed by Congress as part of the American Rescue Plan. Thanks to these subsidies, individuals can save an average of 52 percent on their monthly premium.  While the annual enrollment period has ended, uninsured residents who have been impacted by the recent fires in Boulder County or by COVID-19 can access a new Disaster Relief Special Enrollment Period now through March 16, 2022.  ""These numbers prove Connect for Health Colorado is a success story,"" said Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper. ""Congress needs to keep premiums low to make health care an affordable reality for every Coloradan.""  ""The record level of enrollments we're seeing tells me that people are finding plans in their budget and that our sign-up process is smoother than ever before,"" said Chief Executive Officer Kevin Patterson.  ""While the regular Open Enrollment Period is complete, we opened our doors again. We're here to make sure those who find themselves affected by the recent Marshall Fire and the pandemic can get the coverage and care they need,"" Patterson said.  ""The American Rescue Plan helped make health care more affordable and accessible for nearly 200,000 Coloradans. That is what progress looks like,"" said Colorado Senator Michael Bennet. ""As we continue to face ongoing challenges as a result of COVID-19 and the Marshall Fire, I'm grateful that the enrollment deadline has been extended to ensure more families can get covered this year.""

15,Boots announces big changes to Advantage Card club -and it means more discounts,"Money Boots announces big changes to Advantage Card club -and it means more discounts Boots' loyalty scheme is called the Advantage Card and now shoppers can get exclusive discounts on certain goods, including on brands such as No7 and L'Oréal Paris  Boots has confirmed a huge change to its Advantage Cardloyalty scheme -and it means shoppers can bag bigger discounts.  The high street health and beauty retailer has brought back its Price Advantage initiative permanently, as of this month.  Price Advantage gives exclusive discounts to Boots customers with an Advantage card in over 2,000 stores across the UK.  Shoppers have to hand over their Advantage Card at the tills to get the lower price that is advertised on the shelves.  Customers will know if an item is included in the Price Advantage as they'll be advertised with a pink sticker in stores.  The pink stickers will show the price for Advantage Card holders and the price for other shoppers.  Price Advantage isn't available on the Boots website and shoppers without an Advantage Card won't be able to get the lower prices.  Boots says shoppers will see discounts on around 150 products each month.  This month, customers can save over £8 on the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser Pure Retinol Deep Anti-Wrinkle Night Serum which costs £16.60 for Advantage Card holders, compared to £24.99 for regular customers.  Also on offer is Boots' No7 Lash Extender Fiber Mascara, down to £11.95 from £13.95, as well as Boots' Ingredients Hyaluronic Acid Serum 30ml, which is reduced to £4 from £5.  Do you think Boots' Advantage Card is worth it Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below.  However, just because something is included in Advantage Prices, that doesn't necessarily mean you won't find it cheaper at another store.  Make sure you compare prices online using websites such as Price Spy and CamelCamelCamel to check you're getting the best deal.  Always go for the lowest price to make the biggest saving.  What is an Advantage Card  It is free to sign up for an Advantage Card -you can do this on the Boots website -and the scheme allows you to accrue points as you shop.  Advantage Card holders get four points for every £1 spent -and points are worth 1p each in return.  This means if you collect 100 points, you'd have £1 to spend, while 1,000 points are worth £10.  You can also get personalised discounts sent to you by Boots by being an Advantage Card holder.  A spokesperson from Boots said: ""Helping shoppers get more out of life for less, all Boots Advantage Card holders will be given access to the Price Advantage programme meaning they'll be able to get their hands on even bigger savings by being members of the loyalty scheme.""  Boots says it will also release hundreds of half price deals this month, as well as offering everyday essentials for just £2.",0,0,0
16,Martin Lewis fan explains how he saved £400 after Virgin confirmed price hikes,"Money Martin Lewis fan explains how he saved £400 after Virgin confirmed price hikes MoneySavingExpert.com founder Martin Lewis has explained how a viewer, was able to save £400 after finding a better deal after Virgin Media confirmed it was raising prices  A Martin Lewis  fan has explained how they saved £400 after Virgin Media  announced it was hiking prices.  Virgin last week confirmed that it would raise prices by £56  a year for millions of customers.  The telecoms giant said almost all mobile, TV and broadband customers will be affected from March 1, 2022 -unless the household falls under the 'vulnerable' bracket.  After flagging the price hike on his ITV  show, Martin and his co-star Angelica Bell explained how one viewer has managed to make a huge saving by looking for a cheaper deal elsewhere.  The saver, known only as David, said: ""Thanks to watching the show, I rang Virgin.  ""They weren't able to beat a deal I had found elsewhere and so I've started the process of leaving them? for a deal that is £400 cheaper per year.  ""Plus the new deal has 2.5 times faster speeds!""  It isn't clear what type of deal David had with Virgin, or what new supplier he is switching over to.  But if you're coming out of your current broadband, phone or TV package, then it might be time to check if you can make savings too.  Have you managed to save money on your bills Let us know your story: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  How to save money on your bills  If you're out of contract, the first thing you should do is compare prices to see if you're getting the best deal.  You can compare prices using CompareTheMarket.com , Confused.com , MoneySupermarket.co.uk  or Uswitch.com .  If you do spot a better deal and you're out of contract, you should be able to switch providers for free.  But if you're still locked into a service or you don't want to leave your current provider, then you could try haggling.  Haggling is never guaranteed to always work, but if you do pull it off, you could end up making huge savings.  Start by calling up the customer service centre of your current broadband provider, and then give them details of the cheaper deal you've found -and ask if they can match it.  If they say they can't match it, you could try telling them you're thinking about disconnecting to see if that has any more sway.  Those who are still in contract and are desperate to leave should also check how much they'd have to pay to leave early, as you may still save money if the deal you've found elsewhere is massively cheaper.  For example, if you had to pay £50 to leave your current provider, but a new deal would save you £400 a year, it would be worth paying the exit fee.",0,1,1

This is because you could be deemed to be driving a car in a dangerous condition, if broken or blunt wiper blades stop you from clearing your windscreen properly.  If your wiper blades aren't working, then your visibility of the road could be affected while you're driving.  As well as risking a £2,500 fine, you could also see three points added to your driving licence, according to National Tyres and Autocare.  If the offence is committed within three years of a previous conviction for a similar offence, then you could be disqualified from driving for a minimum of six years.  Failure to have proper control of a vehicle or full view of the road and traffic ahead also carries a fine of £1,000 -or £2,500 for passenger-carrying or goods vehicles.  Section 40a of The Road Traffic Act: Using a Vehicle in a Dangerous Condition Part II, states that: ""A person is guilty of an offence if he uses, or causes or permits another to use, a motor vehicle or trailer on a road when the condition of the motor vehicle or trailer, or of its accessories or equipment is such that the use of the motor vehicle or trailer involves a danger of injury to any person.""  Michael Bourne, Group Marketing Director of National Tyres commented: ""Windscreen wipers are pivotal to safety and being able to see those around you, yet there are so many people unaware of how important it is to keep them in the best possible condition.  ""The last thing a driver wants is to realise their visibility is compromised by defective windscreen wipers when they're travelling at speed or when the weather suddenly turns bad.  ""With winter just around the corner, it's important that motorists are mindful of their own safety and the condition of their vehicle is of paramount importance to other road users.""  Have you successfully appealed a driving fine Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  How to check your wiper blades  Your car can fail its MOT if your windscreen wipers don't work properly or they don't clear your windscreen effectively.  National Tyres and Autocare has provided the following tips to check yours are in working order:  * Check your wipers don't leave streaks and smears behind when they remove rain, debris, or dirt.  * Check if the rubber on your wipers is cracked or split in any way.  * Make sure your wipers are not bouncing off your screen rather than smoothly gliding across the surface of the glass.",0,1,1

The discount applies if you buy six or more bottles of wine, champagne or prosecco and you can claim the money-off orders all week.  The deal on wine, champagne and prosecco began today and it is running until Sunday (May 2).  The store is offering the deal just in time the bank holiday weekend that falls at the beginning of May.  In the deal, a 750ml bottle of posh Moet costs £17.25 with the discount - saving you £5.75 on the full price of £23.  Of course, you'll need to buy six bottles for the deal to kick in. Normally, six bottles would set you back £138 but in the offer the booze costs £103.50.  Alternatively, if you're more of a prosecco fan you can get 750ml bottles of Freixenet Prosecco for £9 each, saving you £3 per bottle.  Normally a box of six would cost £72 but the offer brings the price down to £54.  And if you're more of a fan of wine, a 750ml bottle of Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc was £10, but now it's down to just £7.50 when you buy a crate of six.  The 25% discount excludes any bottles that are under £5 in England or £7 in Wales.  And it also doesn't apply for bottles that are 200ml and under, as well as all Sainsbury's House wine, all fortified wine, boxed wine and gift sets.  It's worth bearing in mind that the deal is only worth it if you were already planning on buy six bottles of plonk, other wise you're spending more money than you need to.  On Sainsburys' website you can browse the wine selection where the qualifying products have a little red offer indicator displayed, which will help you determine what you can get at the bargain prices.  The deal is available online and in stores although online shoppers will need to factor in the delivery costs, which start at £1.

Some suggest that workers offset benefit loss with more saving elsewhere; Evidence from state and...,"Encore News & Commentary What happens when worker benefits are cut? Some suggest that workers offset benefit loss with more saving elsewhere; Evidence from state and local workers suggests that doesn't always happen Evidence from state and local workers suggests that doesn't always happen  The economist's simple life cycle model predicts that workers will respond to a $1 decrease in their defined benefit savings by increasing their supplemental savings by $1. Whether this prediction holds in practice may turn out to be very important for state and local workers.  Read: Saving for retirement? Here are 4 key lessons  Although the common story is that these workers spend a full career in government and retire with substantial defined benefit pensions, that often is not the case - all plans are not equally generous, many plans may lack the funding to pay full benefits, and one in four public sector workers is not covered by Social Security.  Read: What's the best place for you to retire? Pick what matters most - you may be surprised  In other words, a lot of reasons exist for state and local workers to augment their pensions with outside saving, and all state workers and most local workers have access to supplemental defined-contribution plans - namely 457s, 401(k)s, 401(a)s, and 403(b)s.  To see whether public workers take advantage of these options, my colleagues estimated the relationship between participation in a supplemental defined-contribution plan, on the one hand, and low wealth accumulation in a defined-benefit plan, low plan funded levels, or lack of Social Security coverage, on the other. To do this analysis, they merged individual-level data in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) with plan-level data from the Public Plans Database (PPD).  Read: The 5 most affordable Caribbean islands to retire to - and 2 to avoid  The key results suggest that workers do respond to low contributions to their primary defined-benefit plan - the solid red bars in figure 1 below - but the magnitudes are tiny. For example, a one-percentage-point increase in the employer contribution rate is only associated with a 0.19-percentage-point decrease in the participation rate, relative to a baseline of 21%. And the striped bars in Figure 1 show that workers do not respond at all to having a very poorly funded pension plan or not having Social Security coverage.  The bottom line is that people do not always respond as theory would suggest. State and local workers may simply not be aware of how much saving is taking place through their defined benefit pension; they may not appreciate the extent to which their plan is adequately funded; and they may not understand the implications of not being covered by Social Security.  Read: This no-nonsense strategy can get you the retirement you want  Whatever the reason for the lack of response, states and localities cannot count on their workers making up for reduced pension income through supplemental savings.",1,1,0
21,"SCAM ALERT: LOAN REPAYMENT COMPANIES SCAMMING STUDENTS, CHARGING THEM FOR SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR FREE","SCAM ALERT: LOAN REPAYMENT COMPANIES SCAMMING STUDENTS, CHARGING THEM FOR SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR FREE FRANKFORT, Ky., April 16 -- Gov. Andy Beshear issued the following news release:  Today, Gov. Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority (KHEAA) warned that if Kentucky students owe money on federal student loans, they should watch out for scamming loan repayment companies.  The companies offering to help students lower their payments may be charging large fees for services available for free.  ""My administration will always put education first, and part of that means protecting Kentucky students, after they've graduated, from predatory companies trying to take advantage of them as they pay back the loans that helped them pursue their education goals,"" Gov. Beshear said.  Some third-party companies claim to offer document preparation services and act as though they can help students qualify for a loan forgiveness program, but they may want upfront fees and personal and financial information. The Federal Trade Commission says it is illegal for companies to charge upfront fees before providing debt relief services.  The Governor and KHEAA warn borrowers to be skeptical about companies that:  Ask for payment up front and for monthly fees to monitor an account; Promise immediate loan forgiveness; or Ask for a student's FSA ID password and a power of attorney. ""To avoid falling victim to a scam, start with the servicer the Department of Education has assigned your loan to,"" said Gene Hutchins, executive director of the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority. ""Your servicer can tell you what your options are and can help you with the forms you need. And unlike these scam companies, your servicer will never charge you a fee for their assistance.""  If a student doesn't know what his or her servicer is, that information can be found at https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans.  If students believe they have been contacted by a scammer, they should report it to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau here and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office here.  This is KHEAA's Money Tip of the Month.  KHEAA is the state agency that administers Kentucky's grant and scholarship programs, including the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship (KEES). The agency also provides financial literacy videos at itsmoney.kheaa.com and free copies of ""It's Money, Baby,"" a guide to financial literacy, to Kentucky schools and residents upon request at publications@kheaa.com.

23,Biden Administration continues postponement of student loan debt payments for graduates,"Biden Administration continues postponement of student loan debt payments for graduates University of Texas - Austin ; Austin, TX - news  By  Current students and alumni will not have interest accumulating on their public student loans and alumni can defer payment until at least Sept. 30 due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of Education announced on March 30.  Kyle Morgenstein, an aerospace engineering graduate student who completed his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he has about $95,000 in student loan debt. He said not having to pay payments with interest accumulating has been helpful since he started his graduate studies during the pandemic.  ""Not having to pay that for this period means I can put some money away (or) I can spend on other things,"" Morgenstein said. ""I just moved to Austin, so there's moving expenses, so it's definitely freed up a lot of other things that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise.""  When students go into graduate school right after completing undergraduate studies, they can continue to defer payments on their public loans until 6 or 9 months after graduating from their studies, depending on the type of loan, according to the federal student aid website.  Morgenstein said he planned to defer his payments until after he completed his graduate degree, but interest would have continued to accumulate without the COVID-19 relief. He said this would have caused him to pay $30,000 to $40,000 more in interest.  Angel Fletcher, radio-television-film freshman, said she plans to graduate in three years so she does not have to pay for a fourth year of college.  ""I'd love to not rush my schooling and pace myself and make better grades,"" Fletcher said. ""Instead of having $80,000 in debt, maybe I'll have $60,000 if I graduate in three years instead of four (years).""  Law professor Mechele Dickerson, who researches consumer protection and civil procedure, said there would be an economic benefit to canceling some student loan debt. She said if graduates constantly work towards paying off the student loans, they are delaying big life events such as buying a house or having children, which in the long run can have large-scale negative consequences for the economy.  According to The Hill, the Biden Administration is considering cancelling some public student debt through Congress.  Dickerson said it is hard to determine how much student loan debt forgiveness would be helpful to both the economy and the borrowers because of the disproportionate effect student loan debt has on low income students, Black students and Latinx students.  ""The reality is when you look at the average amount of student loan debt, it's about 25,000,"" Dickerson said. ""Most students don't owe 60, 70 (or) $80,000 in student loan debt.""

25,Historic level of funding available to help clinicians pay off student loan,"Historic level of funding available to help clinicians pay off student loan Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville; Edwardsville, IL - news  By  - The National Health Service Corps , a federal government program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration , within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , received a historic $800 million from the American Rescue Plan Act signed into law by President Biden to support the largest clinician workforce in the program's nearly 50-year history. The NHSC Loan Repayment Program helps medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health clinicians pay off their student loan debt in exchange for working in a Health Professional Shortage Area - or a defined geographic area with too few providers.  ""This historic program funding for NHSC means that we will provide a record number of loan repayment awards for eligible clinicians,"" says Dr. Luis Padilla, associate administrator of HRSA's Bureau of Health Workforce and director of NHSC. ""Every community has felt COVID-19's effects and this will allow NHSC applicants to serve in communities where they may not have been competitive to receive an award before due to sites with lower HPSA scores.""  The NHSC is currently taking applications for three NHSC Loan Repayment Programs until May 6, 2021. Eligible disciplines include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, behavioral/mental health clinicians, and more. Qualified clinicians may receive up to $100,000 in educational loan repayment, depending on the award.  Providers may apply for one of three NHSC loan repayment programs:  1) NHSC Loan Repayment Program  This two-year commitment program supports clinicians with up to $50,000 to pay off their student loan debt in exchange for service at an NHSC-approved site.  2) NHSC Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Program  This three-year commitment supports the recruitment and retention of health professionals with up to $75,000. Providers must be working to combat the nation's opioid crisis, expand access to evidence-based, medication-assisted treatment, and prevent overdose deaths in underserved areas. Applicants must work at an NHSC-approved SUD treatment facility located in a HPSA.  3) NHSC Rural Community Loan Repayment Program  This three-year commitment addresses the pressing need for qualified SUD providers in rural communities and awards up to $100,000 in loan repayment funds. Applicants must work at a NHSC-approved SUD treatment facility located in a rural HPSA.  Making an Impact  Currently, over 17 million people receive care from the more than 16,000-strong NHSC network of clinicians serving in urban, rural and tribal areas. Since the NHSC began, more than 63,000 primary care medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health professionals have served. By working with the NHSC, clinicians can help ensure access to health care for everyone regardless of their ability to pay, prevent disease and illness, and care for the nation's most vulnerable people.

26,Chancellor announces 50% 'Eat Out to Help Out' discount for pub and restaurant meals during August,"Chancellor announces 50% 'Eat Out to Help Out' discount for pub and restaurant meals during August People will be able to claim 50% off their meals in pubs and restaurants in August as part of plans to boost the flagging hospitality industry, Rishi Sunak has announced.  The Chancellor unveiled a range of measures to try and help the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic, including a VAT cut on ""food, accommodation and attractions"".  And will be able to save half the cost of their food if they go out to eat between Monday and Wednesday from the Government.  Delivering his summer mini-budget he told the Commons: ""I can announce today that, for the month of August, we will give everyone in the country an 'Eat Out to Help Out' discount.  ""Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50% off, up to a maximum discount of £10 per head for everyone, including children.   ""Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday.  ""Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five working days.""  Mr Sunak said he wants to see pubs, restaurants, cafes and B&Bs ""bustling again"", telling MPs: ""At the moment, VAT on hospitality and tourism is charged at 20%.  ""So I've decided, for the next six months, to cut VAT on food, accommodation and attractions.""  The Chancellor said the sales tax would be reduced to 5% from 15 July to 12 January, 2021.  ""This is a £4billion catalyst for the hospitality and tourism sectors, benefiting over 150,000 businesses, and consumers everywhere - all helping to protect 2.4 million jobs,"" he added.  The Treasury said the temporary VAT cut will apply to ""supplies of food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, pubs, bars, cafés and similar premises across the UK"" - meaning booze is excluded.  The measures were welcomed by the Food and Drink Foundation, but it called for the option of extending the furlough scheme for the hostility industry to be kept on the table.  It chief executive Ian Wright said: ""The UK's food and drink manufacturers who supply into the hospitality and catering trade have been hard hit by the crisis, as their customers disappeared overnight.   ""These 'squeezed middle' firms will enthusiastically welcome the Chancellor's announcement today to cut VAT on food and hospitality and slash the cost of eating out.   ""We hope these measures will lead to a significant boost in demand for the hundreds of manufacturers who supply into hospitality and the out of home sectors and help them to manage increased supply costs.""  He added: ""However, if demand does not return quickly, these firms will continue to struggle unless they - and the sector they supply - receive additional employment support.   ""The Chancellor must therefore keep the option of extending full furlough support to hospitality and their food and drink suppliers in his back pocket so we do not lose vital jobs and businesses.""",1,1,0

28,Workers facing a lifetime of playing pension catch-up,"News Workers facing a lifetime of playing pension catch-up WORKERS in sectors including retail, travel and hospitality could face a lifetime of ""playing catch-up"" with their retirement savings, an insurer has warned.  Scottish Widows said many workers who are now taking a hit to their finances were already finding it difficult to save adequately for retirement before the coronavirus pandemic struck.  They could now struggle with ever being able to afford to retire.  Some are in sectors where businesses are feeling severe economic impacts from Covid-19, including the prospect of widespread job losses.  Scottish Widows' annual retirement report, looking at more than 5,000 adults across the UK, found that: ¦ More than a quarter (27%) of people working in travel and the arts have not yet started saving into a pension; ¦ Two-thirds (67%) of retail workers are worried that if they ever did retire, they would quickly run out of money; ¦ Nearly two-thirds (62%) of construction workers feel they are not preparing adequately for retirement; and ¦ Less than a fifth (18%) of restaurant workers are optimistic about their retirement.  It is highly likely that these workers are now also facing new financial pressures that will make saving for the long term even more difficult, Scottish Widows said.  It said one reason workers have historically been pessimistic about retirement, even before Covid-19, is employers who only contribute the legal minimum amounts into their pension.  Pete Glancy, head of policy at Scottish Widows, said that while around three in five people generally are estimated to be saving adequately for their retirement, ""long-term prospects are still to a large degree defined by the industry in which people work"".  ""That's because while auto-enrolment has transformed the retirement prospects of millions, minimum contributions are still far below what is needed to provide a good standard of living,"" he said.  ""We recognise that the next 12-18 months is going to be about businesses getting back on their feet, but many individuals have taken a substantial hit to their finances and the fear is that the gap can't be closed, meaning they face a lifetime of work as they struggle to afford to retire.""  Scottish Widows also said hardworking ""multi-jobbers"" risk being left behind.  For example, a quarter (24%) of people in travel and tourism and in the arts have more than one job. This rises to 27% of people who work in education, the report said.  In total there are around 6.8 million ""multi-jobbers"" in the UK, Scottish Widows said.  Its report warned they could miss out on pension contributions because their income is split across different employers, so they could fall short of the minimum earnings threshold for automatic enrolment for each of those jobs.  Mr Glancy added: ""The pension system unfairly penalises those who are in low-paid work. Scrapping the minimum earnings threshold would allow millions of multi-jobbers to benefit from auto-enrolment like everyone else, and is long overdue.""",1,1,0
29,"MENENDEZ WARNS OF IMPENDING EVICTION, FORECLOSURE CRISIS DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC","MENENDEZ WARNS OF IMPENDING EVICTION, FORECLOSURE CRISIS DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC WASHINGTON, DC, July 1 -- The office of Sen. Bob Menendez issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate's housing subcommittee, today spoke on the Senate floor to warn his colleagues of a looming foreclosure and eviction crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout if Congress fails to act.  ""[A]n impending storm ... is brewing and headed our way. It will bring with it enormous financial pain. It will threaten public safety. It will make fighting the pandemic that much harder. And it will set back our nation's economic recovery,"" said Sen. Menendez. ""If the Senate fails to respond to this looming crisis, Americans will needlessly suffer, families will be displaced, personal fortunes will be wiped out, and the scars will run so deep, it could take decades to heal the wounds.""  Sen. Menendez urged his colleagues to pass four separate pieces of legislation aimed at stabilizing the housing market and ensuring residents can remain safe and secure in their homes.  This week, he introduced the Coronavirus Housing Counseling Improvement Act (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/search?q=housing+counseling&access=p&as_dt=i&as_epq=&as_eq=&as_lq=&as_occt=any&as_oq=&as_q=&as_sitesearch=&client=wyden&sntsp=0&filter=0&getfields=&lr=&num=15&numgm=3&oe=UTF8&output=xml_no_dtd&partialfields=&proxycustom=&proxyreload=0&proxystylesheet=default_frontend&requiredfields=&sitesearch=&sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&start=0&ud=1) to expand access to critical information, assistance programs and services for millions of families struggling to remain in their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout. According to research, homeowners who receive counseling have a better chance at avoiding default, protecting their credit scores, reducing debt and securing mortgage modifications.  Sen. Menendez announced that he will introduce a separate bill, the Emergency Housing Assistance for Older Adults Act, which would provide $1.2 billion for two key HUD housing assistance programs in order to ensure that federally-assisted senior housing facilities have the necessary resources to effectively protect residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The senator has cosponsored the Housing Assistance Fund (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-will-introduce-bill-to-create-new-75b-housing-assistance-fund-to-keep-nj-families-in-their-homes) to provide $75 billion in targeted assistance to keep people in their homes while they search for new employment or wait to get back to work by helping residents pay the mortgage, utilities, and support to prevent eviction, delinquency or foreclosure. He is also an original cosponsor of the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, which would provide $100 billion to help families pay rent and help property owners maintain safe and healthy housing.

The chain, which was forced to close all 128 outlets on March 18, said it will be back in business next month, with the Government's new safety gudielines in place.  New measures will include 'updated seating maps' to space viewers out while all customers will have to book and confirm via a virtual bookings system.  In a statement, the world's second largest cinema group explained: ""We are excited to announce that we are planning to reopen Cineworld Cinemas across England on 10th July 2020.  ""The opening date is subject to final clarifications and confirmation in regards to UK government restrictions, with dates to follow for our cinemas in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.""  It comes as the lockdown was eased on Monday, allowing non-essential shops to open in England.  Under latest guidelines, drive-in cinemas can now reopen -though the Government has warned that indoor cinemas should not open until July 4 at the earliest.  Cineworld, which has 787 outlets globally, said there will be social distancing when stores reopen, with hand washing stations located throughout branches.  Tickets will be booked in advance on the company website or app -and confirmation emails will be sent in advance of bookings.  New seating maps will also be in place to ""allow friends and family to sit together while ensuring a safe distance between customers from different households"".  But the measures will vary based on the capacity and layout of each screen.  Film start and end times will be staggered to reduce customer interaction, while plastic screens will be placed at the till and PPE will be provided to employees, the company added.  Chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: ""We are thrilled to be back and encouraged by recent surveys that show that many people have missed going to the movie theatre.  ""With a strong slate confirmed for the coming weeks, including among others Tenet, Mulan, A Quiet Place Part II, Wonder Women 1984, Black Widow, Bond, Soul, Top Gun Maverick and many more, the entire Cineworld team remains committed to being ""the best place to watch a movie"".""

Introduced in 2018, the mortgage stress test requires potential buyers - even those with a down payment of 20 per cent or more - to demonstrate that they can afford a mortgage (or home equity line of credit) at a rate two percentage points above the rate being offered or at the Bank of Canada's five-year benchmark rate, whichever is higher.  The stricter mortgage rules were introduced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to shore up the underwriting of banks as Canadian household debt hit record levels. The stress test also helped to cool overheated housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver.  Real estate boards representing realtors from Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver and Edmonton, as well as real estate associations in Quebec and Nova Scotia, have all signed on to Thursday's statement.  The coalition of about 92,000 realtors is also calling on parties to reinstate 30-year mortgages and replace the $750 first-time home buyers tax credit with a $2,500 non-refundable one instead.  They argue the current guideline enforces a ""one-size-fits-all solution"" that's to the detriment of many.  ""Quebec's home ownership rate continues to lag, according to the 2016 census, as it stands at 61 per cent in Quebec compared to more than 70 per cent in Canada's other provinces,"" Julie Saucier, the president of Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers, said in the statement.  ""We believe that there needs to be better support offered to buyers of residential properties, particularly first-time buyers.""  In April, CIBC World Markets deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal released a report showing at least half of the $25-billion decline in new mortgages since 2018 was due to the introduction of the stress test.  The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. has maintained in the past that mortgage stress tests are needed to prevent property price inflation. ""My job is to advise you against this reckless myopia and protect our economy from potentially tragic consequences,"" CMHC president and CEO Evan Siddall wrote in May in a letter to the Standing Committee on Finance.  Siddall said banks have supported the loosening of the regulation only because they're backed by a guarantee from the federal government.  ""I doubt they'd be as cavalier if it were their risk,"" he told the Star in late May. ""Critics of the stress test ignore the fact that high house prices are the overwhelming reason why home ownership is out of reach.""",1,1,0
35,Sharia bank Al Rayan launches a 1.6% easy access account less than a week after Marcus disappointed savers,"Saving & banking Sharia bank Al Rayan launches a 1.6% easy access account less than a week after Marcus disappointed savers * Last week Marcus cut its rate to 1.45% ending its year-long reign at the top  * Following that easy access rates fell across the board  * However Al Rayan Bank has now launched a new top easy access rate  There's a new, and unusual, name at the top of the easy access savings tables.  Just one week on from Marcus Bank cutting its market-leading 1.5 per cent rate to 1.45 per cent and other providers following suit, leading to a gloomy outlook facing easy access savers, one bank has launched a rate higher than Marcus's in its prime.  Sharia bank Al Rayan has entered the easy access savings market for the first time, launching an account that pays 1.6 per cent, considerably higher than the next best offers from Cynergy Bank and Marcus.  The account can be opened online, by phone, or in the bank's branches in Birmingham, Bradford, Glasgow, Leicester, London, Luton or Manchester.  It is worth noting that Al Rayan is a Sharia-compliant bank, which means it cannot pay a guaranteed interest rate.  Instead it pays an expected profit rate, which can change the same way a variable interest rate on an easy access account can.  While this is the bank's first foray into the easy access market, it has offered an easy access cash Isa paying 1.35 per cent since April last year.  That rate nestles among the higher-paying easy access Isas in This is Money's tables, but is hardly a best buy and did not suggest the bank would be launching a rate which blew other providers out of the water.  However, in the fixed-rate market Al Rayan and fellow Sharia bank Gatehouse have consistently offered among the best rates. Right now Al Rayan offers the best rate in our tables on one, two and three year fixed-rate deposits, paying 2.07 per cent, 2.32 per cent and 2.42 per cent, respectively.  Given how Marcus helped drag up the rates offered by easy access accounts when it launched a year ago offering 1.5 per cent, there is a possibility Al Rayan has a similar effect if this account sticks around.  Anna Bowes, co-founder of website Savings Champion, said: 'It's an interesting move from a lesser known provider which has offered competitive rates on its fixed term bonds for quite some time now.  'But this is a competitive move into a new part of the market for Al Rayan. It's an excellent rate, especially under the current conditions and will be interesting to see if it causes other providers to up their game.'  Al Rayan allows account holders to deposit up to £1million into its easy access account, but only deposits up to £85,000 will be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.",0,0,0
36,Schiff Hardin Expands Estate Planning Practice With Ex-UBS Wealth Strategist,"In Brief Schiff Hardin Expands Estate Planning Practice With Ex-UBS Wealth Strategist Schiff Hardin is growing its estate planning practice, adding three attorneys in New York and Chicago, including Stephen Liss, a former UBS strategist who advised high-net-worth families.  Liss joined Schiff Hardin's New York office as a partner in its private clients, trust and estates practice group. The firm also announced Wednesday that Lisa Lukaszewski joined the firm's practice as counsel from Neal, Gerber & Eisenberg while Anna Luna joined as an associate from Ernst & Young. Both will be based in Chicago.  The trio's move comes as Schiff Hardin's revenue has dipped in recent years, according to ALM data. The firm said earlier this year that it was leaning into its trusts and estates practice, as well as other practices that other firms are overlooking.  Liss previously worked as a senior wealth strategist at UBS Financial Services and Barclays. Before that, he was a partner at Withers Bergman.  Schiff Hardin said that during his time in financial services, Liss helped domestic and international high-net-worth clients on income and estate tax planning matters, planned charitable giving and sophisticated life insurance structures.  Liss said that experience will help him as he transitions back into private practice and that he plans to use relationships he's cultivated through his years in financial services to grow his practice.  ""It will be nice to be able to see a project from inception to completion,"" he said in an interview, explaining that while at UBS and Barclays, he was a subjectmatter expert who taught clients about what options were available to them, but did not work with them from start to finish. Now, he hopes to bring his two expertise areas of law and financial planning together at Schiff Hardin.  ""I'm excited to use my experience to integrate legal and financial planning and explore how a financial planner can help a client,"" he said.  His decision to join Schiff Hardin was also influenced by relationships he already had with attorneys there.  ""I had worked with their lawyers before, and I had a really good sense of who did quality work based on what they actually produced, compared to who [in the legal industry] just talked about doing good work,"" he said, noting that a number of Schiff Hardin partners were certified by the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel.  ""This has been an important department for [the firm] for a long time,"" he said about Schiff Hardin's private clients, trust and estates practice group. ""They have a really supportive culture. They're just good, decent people, and I knew that coming in.""  In a statement, Thomas Abendroth, leader of the firm's private clients, trusts and estates practice, complimented Liss' combined experience in private practice and working directly with clients and advisers while at UBS. He said Liss has a ""strong background with counseling private clients and handling complex tax work from his years in private practice.""",0,0,0
37,Waters Opening Statement at Hearing on Student Loan Debt Crisis; House Financial Services Committee News Release,"Waters Opening Statement at Hearing on Student Loan Debt Crisis; House Financial Services Committee News Release Today, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, gave the following opening statement at a full Committee hearing entitled, ""A $1.5 Trillion Crisis: Protecting Student Borrowers and Holding Student Loan Servicers Accountable.""  As Prepared for Delivery  Good morning. Today this Committee convenes for a hearing to examine the student loan debt crisis. It appears that this may in fact be the first ever full Committee hearing in this Committee's history focused on student lending and the many financial ramifications it has for student borrowers. Given the scale of the crisis at hand, it is long overdue. I thank Congressman Al Green, Chairman of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, for convening a Subcommittee hearing on this subject earlier this year, and look forward to building on the insights from that hearing during our conversation today.  According to the Federal Reserve, Americans collectively have over $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. That's more than credit card debt, and more than car loan debt, trailing only mortgage debt. More than 44 million people carry student debt averaging almost $33,000. Around 9 million borrowers with federal student loans are currently in default. The burden of student loan debt is preventing young people from saving for retirement, starting small businesses, starting families, and becoming homeowners. This crisis is affecting people across the country, and ultimately it negatively affects our entire economy.  Nevertheless, Trump's Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, has consistently taken actions that are harmful for those with student loans, and the Trump Administration's appointees to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have also undermined key protections. Just last month, the Trump Administration appointed as Student Loan Ombudsman a former executive of a major student loan servicer that is being investigated by several state attorneys general for illegal student loan servicing practices.  I am pleased that we are joined by an outstanding panel of witnesses today, including witnesses who have personally dealt with student loans, have used their positions to raise awareness about the student debt crisis, or who have fought on behalf of consumers against the harmful practices of student loan servicers.  The Education and Labor Committee has an important role to play in this matter, but this Committee does as well, given the need to strengthen protections for student loan borrowers and conduct oversight in the area of student loan servicing. Today we will discuss a series of bills that are designed to help student loan borrowers in a variety of ways. These bills include creating a comprehensive student borrower bill of rights, strengthening credit reporting standards, stopping private debt collectors from going after vulnerable student borrowers, protecting private student loan borrowers, and helping borrowers with student debt purchase their first home. Congress - and this Committee - have a responsibility to take action to ensure student loan borrowers are better protected.

According to Secure Retirement Institute research, just 16% of American workers believe they are saving enough for retirement. Compounding this is the fact that many workers are not saving for retirement at all: 30% of millennial workers and 21% of Generation X workers have not begun to save for retirement. Retire4Real is designed to show teens the benefits of investing for retirement and to encourage them to begin as soon as they have their first job out of school.  The project is an initiative of the LIMRA LOMA Secure Retirement Institute (SRI) was made possible with the support of the following organizations:      -- Allianz Life Insurance Company  -- Pacific Life  -- JP Morgan                       -- Raymond James  -- Lincoln Financial Group         -- Sammons Annuity Group  -- Nationwide                      -- Voya     ""Most young adults could begin putting money away for retirement in a 401(k) or Roth IRA when they get their first job, but the reality is many don't,"" said Jack E. Kosakowski, president and CEO of Junior Achievement USA. ""While there are several factors behind this, a basic lack of understanding when it comes to retirement planning is certainly one of them.

39,Landlords charge 'pet rent' to recoup losses after ban on unfair fees,"Money Landlords charge 'pet rent' to recoup losses after ban on unfair fees Practice has emerged since new law designed to save renters in England money  Landlords are charging ""pet rent"" running into hundreds of pounds a year in an attempt to recoup losses from a ban on unfair letting fees enforced by the government this summer.  The new practice means tenants with animals are being charged up to £50 a month additional rent for a single pet, adding considerably to the cost of housing at a time when more and more families are priced out of buying and rely on rented homes.  One landlord in Bicester in Oxfordshire is asking £40 per pet in monthly rent in a two-bedroom home that already costs £995 a month for the human occupants. It means a family with a dog and two cats would face a yearly animal rent of over £1,400. Another in Cheltenham is asking £50 a month for ""four-legged friends"" with exemptions for fish or hamsters. Several landlords are seeking pet rent only for ""clawed"" pets.  ""In certain letting agencies it seems to be a standard term in agreements,"" said Darren Baxter, a renter currently searching for a new home in York with his partner, two children and cocker spaniel Padfoot. ""It seems exorbitant given the potential damage a pet can cause. We went to one place where they wanted a reference for the dog. That was ridiculous.""  He said it was another example of how people who cannot afford to buy are disadvantaged in terms of being able to enjoy some of the basics of family life.  One letting agent said the new practice had only emerged since June, when landlords were banned from charging cleaning fees at the end of a tenancy or demanding an additional pet deposit as a result of total deposits being capped at five weeks' rent.  Before the Tenant Fees Act 2019, which was supposed to save renters across England £240m a year, landlords often asked for pet deposits of around £150, repayable at the end of the tenancy. Pet rents now mean they have no choice but to pay more.  ""The only way to do it is to charge higher rent,"" said Karolina Misiukiewicz, administrator at Elliot Oliver, an estate agent in Cheltenham. ""It's a new thing for us. In our experience we haven't taken extra for hamsters or gerbils and definitely not fish.""  Dozens of adverts for homes demanding pet rent can be seen on the rental websites Rightmove and Zoopla, along with many more refusing to take pets.  Half of UK adults own a pet, with 11 million owning cats and almost 9 million owning dogs, according to the veterinary charity PDSA. At the same time more and more families are having to rent. A quarter of families in England rent privately, reaching nearly 1.6m last year, more than double the number recorded in the government's English Housing Survey a decade earlier.",1,1,0
40,"Advice fees vary by 1,000 per cent","News Advice fees vary by 1,000 per cent New research highlights significant divergence in fee structures  Adviser fees for retirement advice can vary by up to 1,000 per cent, new research has found, at the same time as an expert revealed other charging models are starting to gain traction.  A survey conducted by consumer champion Which? asked 108 advisers how much they would charge for advice in three different scenarios, and the results revealed a vast degree of disparity.  In the first scenario, advisers were asked to quote costs for someone approaching retirement, and aiming to start drawing an income, with £100,000 in savings, £150,000 in a pension, and £100,000 in an investment Isa.  The maximum quote from intermediaries was £5,000, 10 times more expensive than the lowest (£500).  Other examples revealed a similar trend. Scenario three described a client with no mortgage and ""comfortable"" savings, with a £100,000 inheritance to invest. Results again were wide-ranging, with the maximum fee at £3,000, the minimum once again at £500, and the average £1,980.  Scenario two took a difference stance, as the individual expressed a need to start saving for a child's education, instead of looking for advice on lump sums. But a vast disparity in fees was still evident. The cheapest, at £300, was still £2,200 lower than the most expensive.  Advice costs have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with the Financial Conduct Authority stepping in after finding that some models present a risk to consumers in certain areas of advice.  The regulator's recent proposal to ban contingent charging for defined benefit to defined contribution transfers is a case in point.  Anecdotally at least, changes are occurring in the way intermediaries charge for advice. In an article responding to the FCA's proposed contingent charging ban, Abbie Knight, founder of Discus, said that over recent years there had been a notable increase in advisers moving towards a ""menu-forservice"" model.  This involves time-costing each piece of work and applying an appropriate profit margin. The fee can then be adjusted for cases that require additional resource due to time or complexity.  Ms Knight said: ""This menubased charging approach is built on the premise that the process and steps involved in delivering each service remains the same, irrespective of the size of the investment.  ""The menu model ensures clients only pay for the service they receive - a stark contrast to the traditional percentagebased charging model."" A further issue of relevance to advisory fees has been the number of consumers feeling priced out of advice, resulting in the much-publicised advice gap. The FCA is revisiting this area via its analysis of the Retail Distribution Review and the Financial Advice Market Review, but its assessments are not due to be published until next summer. craig.rickman@ft.com  'The menu model ensures clients only pay for the service they receive - a stark contrast to the traditional percentagebased charging model'",1,0,1
41,Super Saturday set to see £1.65billion blown on the high street before Christmas,"Money Super Saturday set to see £1.65billion blown on the high street before Christmas 10.1 million shoppers will descend on the high street to spend £1.38 billion on gifts and festive food and drink  Shoppers are expected to spend £1.65 billion on Super Saturday this weekend as they hit the high street in preparation for Christmas Day.  Some 10.1 million shoppers will visit the beleaguered high street to spend £1.38 billion on gifts and festive food and drink, while 4.8 million will spend £268 million online in the hope that their purchases can be delivered on time, according to predictions by VoucherCodes.co.uk and the Centre for Retail Research.  The anticipated rush should provide a fillip after a disappointing weekend for retailers with gales, snow and freezing rain brought by Storm Deirdre blamed for lower shopper numbers.  Combined footfall for high streets, retail parks and shopping centres was down 4.3% on the same weekend last year, according to retail intelligence experts Springboard.  Online sales are expected to peak the day before on 'Frenzied Friday' as 7.2 million shoppers spend £321 million on last-minute gifts.  Laura Ashley 40 new store closures update - what we know about the shops closing  Footfall is expected to be up 20% on the daily average on Super Saturday, while Sunday and Christmas Eve are anticipated to both be up by 5%, according to retail analysts ShopperTrak.  ShopperTrak UK director Steve Richardson said: ""As the last working day for many before Christmas, Frenzied Friday marks the start of the last-minute festive footfall rush, with footfall set to rise across the weekend.  ""Friday is also significant in that it marks the moment that shoppers move away from buying online and instead head into stores to finish off Christmas shopping.  ""In spite of retailers offering later and later fulfilment options, shoppers will head on to the high street, fuelled by the fear that online gifts may not arrive in time for the big day, as well as taking advantage of click-and-collect orders, which some retailers are promising to fulfil on Christmas Eve itself.""  Gift cards could be the worst present possible - your rights if things go wrong  The UK high street has been hit hard this year as several large companies entered administration including House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, which were both bought by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley.  Names such as Toys R Us UK, Poundworld and electronic retailer Maplin also fell into administration, while fashion chain New Look, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams all announced store closures.  Jimmy New, director of marketing at VoucherCodes, said: ""Super Saturday will be a big shopping day for both retailers and consumers alike as millions flock to stores looking to snap up last-minute gifts and other essentials before Christmas Day.  ""It'll certainly be one of the busiest shopping days on the high street so, if you do brave the shops, expect crowds.""  Christmas food and drink",1,1,0

BlackRock has inked its biggest technology partnership yet, aiming to help Americans save for retirement.  The firm is working with Microsoft to build a platform for retirement savings that will launch next year, the world's largest asset manager said Thursday. Spokespeople for Microsoft and BlackRock declined further comment.  The product, which will be offered through employers, is still under development, a source with knowledge of the platform said. It's designed to be user-friendly, with a goal of being as intuitive as ride-hailing application Uber.  The idea stemmed from a conversation earlier this year between BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which the executives discussed creative ways for companies to address America's retirement crisis. Last year, Fink called the problems associated with longevity ""one of the greatest financial challenges faced by our clients today.""  About 40% of Americans said they are not confident they will have enough money in retirement, according to a Wells Fargo survey last month.  BlackRock currently oversees about $1 trillion in defined contribution assets, out of $6.4 trillion total assets under management. The firm is eyeing growth in the space as more private and public employers move away from pricier pensions to cheaper definied contribution plans, in which employees contribute a portion of their paycheck toward retirement.  BlackRock and Microsoft's product will first be available in the US before potentially rolling out to other regions. Through the platform, BlackRock plans to offer new investment options, such as annuities, which provide a regular stream of income in retirement.  The firm's head of Americas, Mark McCombe, is leading the effort for BlackRock. A spokesman for Microsoft declined to identify the technology company's internal leader.

43,Canada pension fund investment into US detention firm larger than reported,"World news Canada pension fund investment into US detention firm larger than reported CPPIB holds $6.1m in investments in Geo Group, a firm that runs US detention facilities under Trump's immigration crackdown  A controversial investment by one of Canada's biggest pension funds in a company which operates private prisons in the United States is larger than initially thought, recent securities filings have revealed.  The Guardian and Documented  reported last month that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) - which manages $366.6bn in pension funds on behalf of some 20 million Canadian retirees - holds stock in Geo Group.  But the most recent regulatory filings show the CPPIB has added to its holdings in Geo Group by 90,000 shares since June - an increase of nearly 50% - bringing the total investment value to $6.1m. It is not known if the fund still holds the shares; the investment board did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Facilities operated by Geo Group have been used in recent months to detain families in the United States, following Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" crackdown on immigration by the American government.  Meanwhile, the CPPIB decreased its holdings of CoreCivic, another private prison company, by 5,900 shares, valuing the investment at $1.65m at the time of filing.  The CPPIB is one of the largest funds in the world, and although the investments in American private prisons companies represent a narrow slice of the overall fund, they have prompted an angry reaction from campaign groups and politicians.  ""I'm very surprised to hear that number is significantly higher than we had previously thought,"" said Emma Pullman of SumOfUs, an advocacy group that started one of two online , an advocacy group that started one of two petitions     calling on the fund to divest its holdings. Between them, the two petitions have received more than 45,000 signatures.  Selling the investment would mark a significant move for the CPPIB, which prides itself in resisting external lobbying attempts.  But public outcry appears to have rattled the board. On 14 November, the board convened a meeting with activists from two separate groups, both petitioning the investment board to divest its holdings.  ""I think the reason they're looking into these options is because the writing is on the wall,"" said Logan McIntosh, a campaigner with the Leadnow advocacy group, who attended the meeting. ""It's an unnecessary and shameful investment and it's undermining the confidence of Canadians that they can manage our retirement savings responsibly.""  Every two years, the CPPIB hosts legally mandated presentations across the country to outline its investment strategy and allow the public to ask questions.  ""I don't think Canadians are interested in profiting from the abuse of humans and the caging of children,"" said Darcie Lanthier, a former financial advisor who attended one such event in Charlottetown. ""I know, with what little savings I have, I go out of my way to ensure my investments are doing no harm.""",0,0,0

The Higher Education Act hasn't been updated in more than a decade, and many believe it's time for an overhaul. Changes are likely to affect the way students apply for financial aid and the way the federal aid system is structured. Although partisan politics exist in any policy debate, including this one, there appear to be several areas of shared concerns, including:  * The costs are too high for too many Americans.  * The federal student financial aid application is too long and complicated.  * Federal aid and repayments are confusing and don't cover job training programs and apprenticeships.  * Applicants for federal aid find out too late what they will be receiving to plan well.  --Magazine staff   Average Cost to Attend a Year of College or University, 2015                                     Public   Private nonprofit  On campus                          $23,300  $47,400 Off campus living with family      $14,100  $37,500 Off campus not living with family  $23,800  $46,900  Note: Table made from bar graph.

Dietitian reveals the cheap, often-overlooked 'superfoods' that you can pick up at your local supermarket for a fraction of what on-trend items cost * You don't need to spend a lot of money to reap the rewards of superfoods  * A dietitian has revealed the cheaper alternatives people can include in their diet  * Amelia Harray explained that there is 'no definition of a superfood'  'Superfoods' have been the buzzword in the health industry for a few years, but many simply cannot afford to splash out on kale and coconut water during their weekly shop.  Luckily for those trying to save their cash, there are plenty of fruits and vegetables that are just as good.  Today Tonight spoke with dietitian, Amelia Harray, who revealed the less expensive alternatives people can include in their diet to reap the same health benefits.  'There's no definition of a superfood, which makes it really confusing for people,' she said.  Scroll down for video  LEAFY GREENS  Kale became popular years ago, with many people palming it off as a passing fad, but it is a healthy addition to any diet.  The leafy green is high in folate and vitamin K, like iceberg lettuce, and although it has a good amount of fibre, spinach has more.  'Spinach actually contains more iron than kale does too,' Amelia explained.  Unfortunately what some people don't realise is that when you blend fruit and vegetables their fibre content decreases.  'I really encourage people to eat food rather than drink it, because when you're eating, you're chewing, and you're actually getting really full from the fibre, your gut is having to work,' Amelia said.  OLIVE OIL  Coconut oil is another item that has been deemed a 'superfood', but Amelia doesn't think it deserves that title.  'There is no benefit from coconut oil in cooking. if anything it'll just increase your bad cholesterol in your blood,' Amelia warned.  'You're far better off eating olive oil, avocado oil, canola oil and rice bran oil.  'There are lots of options that are much cheaper and much better for you.'  BANANAS  Since bananas are easily accessible in a lot of countries, they are often over-looked.  Although coconut water is rich in nutrients and is definitely good for you, studies have shown that it doesn't do any better a job of hydrating you than water.  '[It has] nutrients like magnesium, potassium and phosphate, but so do bananas, and you're paying a lot more for coconut water,' Amelia said.  AVOCADO  Two members behind Peak Body fitness, Faye Sheridan and Tony Merrick, said they believe it's good to know what you're body is lacking in.  Although they understand that health powders are popular, they like to stick with wholefoods first, such as homemade kimchi, eggs and avocado.  The pair believes that people should be mindful of the social media hype of superfoods and supplements.",1,1,0

Trading screens were a sea of red across Europe, as the FTSE 100 index dropped 86.4 points or 1.2 per cent to close at 6,952.59 - back below the 7,000 mark for the first time since November 2016.  A senior US official said today that the European Union and six other countries will be exempt from steel and aluminium tariffs announced by President Trump, at least temporarily.  But Robert Lighthizer's claim that President Trump had decided to 'pause' the import duties while further discussions took place could not assuage traders' concerns as Mr Trump prepared restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on nearly $50billion worth of Chinese imports.  According to the Press Association the move is to 'punish Beijing for stealing American technology and pressuring US companies to hand it over'.  China is already warning it will take 'all necessary measures' to defend itself, raising the prospect of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.  Aside from the EU, Mr Lighthizer said Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea would be exempted from tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium are due to come into effect on Friday.  The London market was already down when the US stock market opened sharply lower, which fed back to more selling in London.  American technology stocks slumped in the wake of Facebook's data privacy scandal, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling 87.81 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 7,257.47.  Facebook's share price continued to fall following weekend's news that Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50million Facebook users to try to sway US elections.  Today, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg broke the silence by apologising for the mistakes his company made in how it handled the data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.  'This was a major breach of trust. I'm really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data,' Zuckerberg told CNN.

Peggy Ruhlin, the chief executive of Budros Ruhlin & Roe, accepted the Alexandra Armstrong Award for Lifetime Achievement and encouraged all the women in the room to ""dream big, then make it happen.""  Ms. Ruhlin is perhaps best known for engineering the merger of the Institute of Certified Financial Planners and the International Association for Financial Planning to create what is known today as the Financial Planning Association.  She's also known as an advocate for women in finance. At Budros Ruhlin & Roe, Ms. Ruhlin has pushed the firm to hire and develop female professionals, and serve female clients.  ""Her forward-looking approach and get-it-done attitude, along with the numerous major accomplishments she has spearheaded, are among the many reasons Peggy is our Lifetime Achievement award honoree this year,"" said Suzanne Siracuse, publisher of InvestmentNews.  In accepting the award, Ms. Ruhlin thanked her colleagues and raised a toast to her family, saying she lives by the motto, ""Nothing is more important than family.""  As part of the award, InvestmentNews donated $5,000 to the Foundation for Financial Planning, a charity selected by Ms. Ruhlin.  This year's Women to Watch included a new ""Rising Star"" award to honor an emerging leader and role model for next-generation advisers: Rianka Dorsainvil, the founder of Your Greatest Contribution, a fee-only financial planning firm.  CHANGING THE IMPOSSIBLE  ""Being the first at anything is pretty scary. It means you are setting the stage and foundation for those to come after you,"" Ms. Dorsainvil said. ""To the ladies in the audience who will also be the first at something, being the first means you look at the 10-letter word 'impossible' and change it to 'I'm possible.'""  Before the luncheon, the 2017 honorees joined honorees from 2015 and 2016 for a discussion on how to improve financial literacy for women of all ages. The goal was to identify some small changes that could make a difference in the world if embraced by many, such as introducing high school students to financial planning as a career opportunity.  Caitlyn Gimler, a student at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, told the group that a personal finance class at her high school, which was created thanks to a donation from Pershing CEO Mark Tibergien, helped inspire her to pursue a career in financial planning instead of law.  Ms. Gimler said that none of the girls at her high school had named finance or even business when asked what they wanted to do in life, and she thinks programs like Women to Watch could change that.  ""Having women in this career is really important,"" she said. ""It's up to us to do something about that. We have the resources to do it.""  Twitter: @ryanwneal",0,0,0

Shortly after, I received a message from the buyer's official eBay account asking me to send the coins to a different address.  I duly sent the recorded delivery package as requested.  According to Royal Mail tracking, it arrived the next day.  Two days later, after the coins had been signed for, I received an email from PayPal stating that the buyer's account had been hacked and the money I had received was an unauthorised payment.  Once I explained that there had been a change of address, PayPal promptly refunded my money back to the buyer from my account. So I have lost the money and the gold coins.  eBay has now refunded its commission to me and PayPal has paid back half of what I lost but I am still out of pocket to the tune of £1,023.  Can you get this back for me?  JJ, Warwickshire  Initially I approached eBay, which said that because you had sent the items to a different address there was nothing more it could do.  It said it is important for sellers to send items to the address provided in their buyer's ""View Order Details"".  It said: ""Sending the item to another address is likely to mean the item isn't covered by seller protection.""  With PayPal, as usual there were promptings from me, calls not returned and wrong responses that I had to correct.  My involvement did lead to PayPal issuing you with a full refund ""as a goodwill gesture"", so the remaining £1,023 has been reimbursed.  Its response had been in a similar vein to eBay's, with it saying: ""Our Seller Protection policy can cover the cost of unauthorised payments, if the seller can provide us with proof of postage and delivery to the buyer's address as specified in the transaction confirmation. In Mr J's case he sent his goods to a different address.""  I had checked PayPal's seller protection and thought that gold anyway was not eligible. PayPal had not picked up on this and only when I queried this came back saying that PayPal's seller protection does not indeed cover payments made in respect of gold in any physical form.  Previously it admitted it had been distracted by the address issue.  The item had been delivered to a flat above a taxi service. I called the taxi service, which said the flats were rented independently.  I suggested that, armed with the crime number you acquired when you reported this matter to Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre, (0300 123 2040 and actionfraud.police.uk), you should urge the local police to pay a visit.

49,Draw up your will in a text message,"Sport Draw up your will in a text message Law Commission says 'outdated' system of inheritance must catch up with digital age  PEOPLE will be able to use voicemail and text messages to make their wills under a radical overhaul of inheritance laws proposed by the Government's legal advisers.  The Law Commission has branded the legacy system ""outdated"" and said it must keep up with the digital age.  Under laws which date back to 1839, wills need to be written and signed by the testator as well as two witnesses in order to be valid. The commission suggests those rules are unclear.  It has called for the law to be relaxed to allow notes, emails and voicemail messages to be used in place of a written will. Under its proposals, new powers would allow county and high court judges to decide ""on the balance of probabilities"" whether a recording or note is an accurate summary of a person's wishes. Deathbed changes of heart could be recorded and used to overrule an existing valid will.  The Commission has admitted that the proposals could add to family arguments. It said: ""A person who is seriously ill in hospital may have more immediate access to a tablet or smartphone than to a pen and paper, and may be more able to speak than to write. On the other hand, the potential recognition of electronic documents could provide a treasure trove for dissatisfied relatives.  ""They may be tempted to sift through a huge number of texts, emails and other records in order to find one that could be put forward as a will on the basis of a dispensing power.""  The powers already exist in Australia, Canada, South Africa and several American states.  Experts urged caution amid concerns older people could be pressured into last-minute changes. Caroline Abraham, Age UK charity director, said: ""Whilst we welcome this public consultation, any proposed changes must not create further barriers for people who wish to plan ahead, and ensure that older people are able to make their own decisions wherever possible, free from pressure and coercion.""  Elizabeth Neale, partner in the private wealth team at the law firm Bircham Dyson Bell, said that weakening the rules could have ""worrying"" implications for vulnerable people and there could be ""pressure on people to write something down or make a voicemail"".  Prof Nick Hopkins, a member of the Law Commission, said: ""Any new law would protect vulnerable testators against possible undue influence, and certainly if there was any suggestion that that had been exercised, the court isn't going to use the dispensing power. But this is a consultation, so if anyone has those concerns, they should let us know.""  The proposals also suggest changing the law about mental capacity to make it easier to assess whether someone with dementia is able to make a will and lowering the age someone can make a will from 18 to 16.  The consultation, which launches today, will run until Nov 10.",0,1,1
50,Pension fund moves into riskier investments; Venture Capital,"Financial Post Investing Pension fund moves into riskier investments; Venture Capital Frustrated by poor returns, OPTrust chief executive Hugh O'Reilly is moving into riskier investments as contributors to the retirement fund age.  ""We can't just match cash flows, we have to take risks,"" O'Reilly, whose company oversees $19.2 billion of investments for Ontario government workers, said in an interview. ""We don't want to increase contributions or reduce future benefit accruals where the active members will bear the whole risk.""  OPTrust is starting a $300-million venture-capital portfolio and is considering derivatives linked to insurance risk, O'Reilly said. The firm has allocated 1.5 per cent to these riskier assets and three per cent in hedge funds, though the latter is under review, O'Reilly said without elaborating. The fund more than doubled assets in hedge funds in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to the 2016 annual report.  ""We want to allocate relatively small amounts of capital into new and different investment areas,"" O'Reilly said. OPTrust will then ""see if they're viable, see if they make sense, see if we can incubate them and bring them back and put them where they best belong on the investment team.""  OPTrust, which manages pension assets for almost 90,000 former and current members of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, generated a return on investment of six per cent for last year. That was down from eight per cent in 2015 and was less than half the 2016 return of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country's largest pension plan.  ""Investment returns are unpredictable and can result in a wide range on any one-year basis,"" O'Reilly said. ""We know that our portfolio can deliver on our pension sustainability objectives over the long run.""  O'Reilly declined to say what OPTrust targets in returns, saying it is focused more on the amount of risk exposure it can tolerate.  The new venture-capital fund, known as the Incubation Portfolio, will target latestage startups that are mostly already profitable, O'Reilly said. Another large Canadian pension fund and a venturecapital firm, which he declined to name because the details are still being worked out, will help fund and guide some of the investments, he said. ""Venture capital is where the future is in terms of Canada, understanding risk and disruption,"" O'Reilly said. ""We're going to get active in this area.""  The strategy tweak comes as the number of workers that support the Torontobased fund is falling. Between 2007 and 2016, its retirees rose 60 per cent to more than 36,000, while its active members fell 8.7 per cent to almost 44,000, according to the pension fund.  The pension will keep outside management for most of its equity trading, some of it by RBC's PH&N Investment Services and Beutel, Goodman & Co., because of attractive pricing and the ability to learn from industry experts, O'Reilly said.",0,0,0
51,Equity release: read these top tips before you borrow against your home,"Banking Equity release: read these top tips before you borrow against your home Equity release is becoming more popular among older homeowners. It allows those aged 55 or more to borrow a lump sum against the value of their home, with interest payments normally deferred until the house is sold when the owner dies or goes into care.  There are various reasons why equity release might be attractive to homeowners: they may want cash to help a grandchild buy a home, for example, or may need to supplement their own pension income - there are versions of equity release that allow you to make regular withdrawals.  If you do withdraw a lump sum, you can choose to make interest payments so that the sum repayable does not grow; if you allow interest to roll up instead, the amount borrowed can become very large should you live a long time, although equity release plans come with a ""no negative equity"" guarantee.  There are several crucial things to consider before you choose equity release.  Nigel Waterson, chairman of the Equity Release Council, the industry body, said: ""For anyone considering taking out an equity release plan, there are a number of things to consider.  ""First and foremost, it is important that you speak with a qualified adviser who belongs to the Equity Release Council. They will be able to provide you with professional guidance and will ensure that you are able to consider all your options.""  Here are ten top tips to consider:  * Do some research. Unbiased information can be found via the Money Advice Service Guide to Retirement and at equityreleasecouncil.com .  * Consider all your options. Make sure all state benefits are claimed and think about downsizing, renting out a room or asking for help from your family.  * If you take out an equity release plan to pay off an interest-only mortgage, speak with your existing lender to discuss all the options they can offer.  * Discuss your plans with family. They may be able to help or support your decision to take equity release.  * Compile a budget planner to work out what your income requirements are and how they might change over the years.  * If equity release is needed for home improvements, check to see if the local authority offers any grants for the work required.  * Don't take for granted what others tell you about equity release but make sure you speak with a qualified adviser who is a member of the Equity Release Council.  * In addition, take independent legal advice.  * Consider the type of equity release you need. An adviser will help you understand the difference between home reversion plans (where ownership is transferred to the lender at the outset), lifetime mortgages and the different types of plan.  * Don't assume that the lowest interest rate is the best. The plans have various features, some of which may be more suitable. For instance, some allow you to make monthly repayments to avoid the interest rolling up.  Sign up to our emails",1,1,0
52,Getting a loan is all about risk,"Getting a loan is all about risk IF YOU are thinking about applying for a home loan, it's important to gain an understanding of what the banks and lenders look for in the approval process.  The lender will assess your financial position and ability to service the loan, and based on the level of risk that you impose on them, will make a decision on how much or how little they are prepared to lend you, says Loan Market.  Let's look at some of the important key measures used by lenders to help assess your risk.  Income  Your current income will be used to determine the amount of money you can borrow.  Earning a higher income could suggest that you are able to better service your home loan.  But it's not just about what you earn - the lender will also look at your employment history and tenure.  In addition, they will assess your employment status (i.e. full-time, part-time, casual, permanent) to better understand your position.  In the case of self-employed applicants, the process may require more work and further lender scrutiny as the risk is usually higher.  Credit history  Your credit history gives the lender an indication of how you conduct your debts.  Having a clean credit history can increase your chances of borrowing a higher amount because it demonstrates that you are a responsible borrower.  You can request a copy of your credit file to ensure there isn't a black mark against your name.  The last thing you want is to be knocked back by your lender because of a telco default you incurred a few years ago.  In Australia, you can obtain your credit report from VEDA for free.  Deposit amount  The larger the amount you have for a deposit, the less risk the lender is taking when lending to you.  Having regular and consistent deposits made into your bank account will show the lender your ability to save despite having other current expenses.  Debts  Having debts can also determine your borrowing eligibility.  If you have any outstanding debts such as credit cards or personal loans, it would be beneficial to have them paid off before applying for a home loan.  If you have multiple debts, combining them into one could also help to reduce your repayments, which will look more favourable to the lender.  The lender will assess how much money you have left over (after paying your debts) and determine whether you will still be able to afford paying a mortgage.  A mortgage broker plays a key role when you're looking for home loan approval.  You can speak to them about the best way to position yourself to maximise your chances of having your home loan approved.  If you're looking to roll your debts into one, a mortgage broker can talk to you about your options when it comes to a consolidation loan.  This can not only reduce your monthly repayments but can also get you a lower interest rate.",1,1,0
53,Warning on rate hikes,"Business Warning on rate hikes HOME loan borrowers face a short and sharp series of interest rate hikes which threaten to add an extra $375 to the average monthly repayment bill, a former Reserve Bank board member has warned.  Highly-respected economist John Edwards says home loan borrowers should brace for eight consecutive hikes to the nation's official cash rate over the next two years.  Mr Edwards said the cash rate is ""way below"" where it needs to be should the RBA's own economic growth and inflation forecasts pan out.  The cash rate would need to be hiked from 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent by the end of 2019 if Australia's economic growth rate return to 3 per cent in the next few years as the RBA expects, Dr Edwards said.  The average standard variable mortgage would rise from 4.44 per cent to 6.44 per cent under such a scenario, analysis from financial services firm Mozo shows.  A borrower with a $300,000 loan would need to find $375 extra per month. ""It seems to me that something like eight quarter-percentage-point tightenings over 2018 and 2019 are distinctly possible if the RBA's economic forecasts prove correct,"" Dr Edwards wrote in a paper for the Lowy Institute think tank.  ""It's possible the tightening could start earlier, or if not the tightening itself, at least the signalling which should precede it.  ""We may be seeing a little of that now."" Dr Edwards said the current cash rate was outside any historic norm given it had averaged 5.2 per cent over the past 20 years and only fell to 3 per cent in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.  While the RBA would not want to increase rates ""too abruptly or unexpectedly"", Dr Edwards cautioned the inevitable lift in borrowing costs would not necessarily be ""gentle or gradual."" Former RBA governor Ian Macfarlane hiked the cash rate 1.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent in the 10 months to August 2000 while his successor Glenn Stevens took less than two years to lift the rate from 5.5 per cent in April 2006 to 7.25 per cent in March 2008.  The Bank for International Settlements, the governing body of central banks, this week warned Australia's record levels of household debt leaves it highly vulnerable to a sharp rise in global interest rates.  AMP Capital chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said Dr Edward's forecast ""seemed extreme"" and noted the RBA had consistently over-estimated economic growth in recent years.  Dr Oliver said low wage growth and underemployment would keep inflation low for the foreseeable future.  ""I struggle to see much of any interest rate hikes in the coming years,"" he said.

GETTY  The Bank of England has expressed concern over household debts  Lenders will have to make sure that customers can manage repayments at a rate of around seven per cent - far higher than the rate they are likely to be applying for.  It means borrowers will only be able to qualify for a loan if they could afford bills at the higher rate, which is around three percentage points above the typical Standard Variable Rate ,  It comes as the Bank of England today warned in its bi-annual Financial Stability Report that credit card debt, personal loans and motor finance grew much faster than household income over the past 12 months.

Next month the the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority are to publish a report on the consumer credit market, which could impose tighter lending rules on firms, which will be supported by the Bank's Financial Policy Committee .  Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ""The Bank of England is right to take action to curb the huge growth in household borrowing we are seeing.  ""While most households can cope with this extra borrowing now, many risk finding themselves exposed to financial difficulty should their circumstances change.  ""In these uncertain economic times, the Bank's intervention to limit this risk is welcome.

55,"Online firm pairs home buyers, sellers with realtors","News Online firm pairs home buyers, sellers with realtors Lots of folks turn to online dating, using quizzes, photos and profiles to find a life partner.  So why not use that strategy for another big commitment - finding a realtor to buy or sell your home ? That ' s the rationale behind fivewalls (fivewalls. com) a new online business co-founded by a London entrepreneur that matches home buyers and sellers with a select group of experienced realtors.  The service is free to home buyers and sellers. They complete a quiz on the qualifications they want in their realtor, what kind of home they want to buy or sell, the location and price range.  Fivewalls comes back with a short list of realtor profiles, including a personal video produced by London-based Lemontree Photography. The profile lists the realtors ' recently sold homes, the number of transactions in the past year and total years of experience.  "" They can get to know an agent without taking a lot of time to meet them. They can review them at their leisure ,"" said Paul Hayman, who launched the business with a partner a year ago.  Since it was launched, fivewalls has signed up 400 realtors in London, Kitchener-Waterloo and Guelph and about 24,000 people have visited the website to search for an agent.  Fivewalls gets its revenue from member realtors by getting a slice of the commission when a home is sold.  Hayman said fivewalls is poised to jump into the Toronto-area market this spring.  Though he grew up in Belleville, Hayman has deep roots in London. His great-grandfather founded Hayman Construction.  Hayman graduated from Western University and has lived in London for 30 years. He served as entrepreneur-in-residence at Ivey Business School.  Hayman and some partners scored a success developing TFC (The Franchise Company) into a major corporation, selling out to the majority shareholder.  He later gained a background in housing, working with a Texasbased think-tank trying to deal with communities facing widespread vacancies after the housing crash in 2008.  Hayman formed fivewalls in partnership with Lee Piccoli, chief executive of Guelph-based Fusion Homes.  Home buyers and sellers often hooked up with agents by wordof-mouth or meetingthem at open houses, Hayman said.  But with the real estate market moving online, there was a need for people to research real estate agents online, along with homes, he said.  "" From the estimates we had, about 10 per cent of the market was already doing that and we thought we could build a business on that ."" More recent research shows 30 per cent of consumers are finding real estate agents online, Hayman said.  The London-St. Thomas real estate market has been hot for months and is on track to hit record sales this year.  But the downside for realtors is that competition for listings is intense.  Agents from major brokerages including ReMax, Royal LePage and Sutton Group have joined fivewalls, Hayman said.  / (See hardcopy for photo);",0,0,0
56,Maternity leave - What happens if the baby's born early,"Money Maternity leave - What happens if the baby's born early Every woman working in the UK is allowed 52 weeks' leave after they have a baby - but what happens if the baby is premature? These are your rights  For some mothers, everything is straightforward. Their baby returns home with them from hospital straight from the labour ward and their maternity leave continues for the next 52 weeks if they want.  For others, things are less simple.  That's because maternity leave automatically starts from the day you give birth, not the day your child's strong enough to come home with you.  ""An employee can choose to start her maternity leave on any day, provided that it is not longer than 11 weeks before the week the baby is due,"" explained Aye Limbin Glassey, employment law partner at Shakespeare Martineau.  ""However where a baby is born prematurely her maternity leave starts automatically on the day after the date of the birth, no matter whether born prematurely or not.""  Statutory Maternity Pay explained: How to get it, how much money you can claim and how long it lasts  ""When workers have children prematurely, they are under an enormous amount of strain dealing with the baby and even when their child is well enough to leave hospital care, they will have to face the stark reality that a significant chunk of their statutory leave and pay has been used up,"" Limbin Glassey explained.  ""This seems harsh and it is understandable that parents in this position would feel that they need more flexibility and support.  ""However, under current laws, maternity leave and pay automatically starts the day after a premature baby is born and employers are under no obligation to extend this,"" she added.  The good news is that this week an amendment to the law is being debated in Parliament that would change things if passed.  ""If the amendment ... is made law, employers could be obliged to delay the start of maternity leave and pay to begin only after the period for which the premature baby is under hospital care,"" Limbin Glassey said.  Meet the mum campaigning for more maternity leave for mothers of premature babies  While things could soon change, that's of little help to people having children before then.  So what can you do now?  ""We advise that parents facing this situation start discussions with their employer at the earliest opportunity to enable the employer to put necessary arrangements in place and limit disruption,"" Limbin Glassey said.  ""The more time an employer is given to be able to fully consider the options and plan, the more likely it is that an agreement can be reached.  ""This is understandably unlikely to be the parent's top priority, so they may want to consider nominating someone like a family member to maintain communication with their employer on their behalf.  ""This will allow for a mutually-beneficial working relationship throughout the maternity period and beyond.""  Was your baby born too soon? (JotForm)",1,1,0
57,Australia : New data highlights the flaws in failed VET FEE-HELP scheme,"Australia : New data highlights the flaws in failed VET FEE-HELP scheme New statistics released today reveal the full extent of the failure of Labors VET FEE-HELP scheme that has seen unscrupulous providers prey on vulnerable students and the cost to taxpayers blow out from $325 million in 2012 to $1.8 billion in 2014 and $2.9 billion in 2015.  Minister for Education and Training Simon Birmingham said the issues with VET FEE-HELP are why the Turnbull Government will shut it down at the end of 2016 with the new VET Student Loans program starting in January with course restrictions for providers, loan caps and student engagement requirements.  The 2015 data is littered with even more examples of rorting and shonky behaviour from some providers who continue to take advantage of students and taxpayers and tarnish the reputation of the vocational education and training sector, Minister Birmingham said.  The Turnbull Governments new VET Student Loans program will return integrity to the vocational education sector and deliver a win-win for students and taxpayers through a range of protections.  Minister Birmingham said the new data showed the number of enrolments had increased from just 5,300 in 2009 to around 321,000 in 2015, highlighting the runaway growth in the scheme before our initial reforms started to fix it in 2016.  Minister Birmingham said that the structure of VET FEE-HELP scheme meant there were too many students being signed up for courses simply to boost providers enrolment numbers or to provide lifestyle choices that dont lead to work.  Australians rightly expect that any subsidies students get are focused on areas of study most likely to improve employment outcomes, Minister Birmingham said.  Vocational education is a key feature of post-school learning in Australia and it is fundamental to our future success as we transition to a 21st century economy. But that means we also need to ensure that taxpayer support for students is targeted at skills that are in high demand and valued by employers.  These new statistics highlight that up to one in five students were doing VET FEE-HELP courses not to improve their job prospects, but to pursue lifestyle interests. While I understand some people may want to broaden their experiences, we need to ensure precious taxpayer money is used to support students doing courses with strong employment outcomes, which also increases the prospects of people paying back their government loan.  All diploma level courses were eligible under VET FEE-HELP, which meant we had a list of more than 800 courses being subsidised by taxpayers despite many being lifestyle focused with little relevance to employment outcomes.  With our new VET Student Loans program we will ensure providers go through a rigorous application process and extensive monitoring and evaluation to ensure they are delivering education that students and employers value and that taxpayers are willing to continue supporting.  VET Student Loans will only support legitimate students to undertake worthwhile and value-for-money courses at quality training providers.",1,1,0
58,Bond fund warning as sell-off fears increase,"Business Bond fund warning as sell-off fears increase BONDS Savers may find they cannot withdraw cash if the market hits trouble, says James Connington  Turmoil in bond markets and a spike in the number of investors wanting to withdraw money ""raises questions"" about the suitability of popular bond funds, leading analysts have warned.  Bond funds - where savers' cash is pooled and then invested in loans issued by governments and companies - are among the most popular holdings in savers' Isas and pensions.  Many savers view them as a supposedly lower-risk source of income.  But analysts Manuel Arrive and Alastair Sewell of Fitch, the ratings agency, this week questioned whether these funds could withstand a rush to the exit by investors alarmed by a fall in bond prices. They have suggested some funds restrict withdrawals to weekly intervals.  They argue that while these funds allow withdrawals to be made on a daily basis, their managers may struggle to sell holdings quickly enough to be able to pay out.  One outcome could be the forced sale of holdings at poor prices into an already falling market. Another could be the decision by fund managers to temporarily restrict withdrawals.  The warnings are reminiscent of the difficulties facing commercial property funds earlier this year, when a sharp increase in withdrawals forced funds to stop dealing until they could raise cash by selling buildings.  With ""open ended"" funds, such as unit trusts, investors buy units. There is no limit to the number of units that can be issued.  When withdrawals occur, the fund needs to have the cash to meet them and the units are then cancelled.  If there is little or no market to sell holdings to at the time, managers can battle to put a value on the portfolio and individual units.  With property funds, this dilemma could be seen in the ""temporary value adjustments"" that applied to many over the summer.  Mr Arrive said: ""We haven't seen the same reaction from investors in bond funds as was seen in several UK property funds following the Brexit vote. Some fund types are going to be more exposed to liquidity risk if investor sentiment turns quickly.""  According to Fitch's report, the need to meet redemption requests at all times has pushed open-ended bond fund managers to maintain higher cash balances, hindering performance.  While Fitch acknowledged that managers have ""taken steps"" to better manage the risk posed by liquidity, the report claims ""there have been few evolutions in the redemption terms and conditions for open-ended funds"".  By comparison, investment trusts, or ""closed-ended"" funds have a natural release mechanism built in.  Investors buy shares in the investment company itself from a limited issue, and the share price can swing to a premium or a discount compared to the value of the underlying holdings.  In July, Muna Abu-Habsa, an analyst at investment data firm Morningstar, suggested that unit-trust type funds should be limited in the level of illiquid holdings they contain.",0,1,1

60,MARKET MOVERS THOMAS WELLS & PAUL PARASCANDALO,"Business MARKET MOVERS THOMAS WELLS & PAUL PARASCANDALO Thomas Wells and Paul Parascandalo are co-fund managers with Aviva Investors, which has £319bn (?363bn) of assets under management.  Their responsibilities include the Multi Asset Fund (MAF) Strategic, which is open to investors with a lump sum of at least ?5,400 or those who agree to invest ?100 a month.  Philosophy The MAF Strategic invests in a selection of different asset classes including cash, bonds, equities, property and alternatives such as commodities. It's designed for investors looking for a balanced mix between investments that offer potential for growth but are more defensive in nature.  ""We're trying to create an investment solution that ensures ongoing suitability for investors,"" said Wells. ""It's not just finding a solution that is appropriate for an investor at a single point in time, but one that is an appropriate solution on an ongoing basis.""  Performance The fund is up 3.4% over a year, while over three years the fund is up an average of 7.6% a year. The fund's five-year annualised return is 7.4%.  ""Last year was a challenging period but we invest for a three-year time horizon and on that basis our performance has been very good,"" said Wells.  Buying and selling The fund classifies its holdings under three broad categories: growth assets such as equities and high yield bonds; defensive assets which include government and investment grade bonds; and uncorrelated assets such as property.  The fund has recently taken profits on some of its growth asset holdings including North American, European and emerging market equities.  ""There's been a very strong rally in the last number of months so we took some money of the table,"" said Wells. ""We will go back in at more attractive levels if there is any sort of correction.""  Wells said that over the past nine months the fund had increased its holding of global high yielding bonds as well as emerging market currency bonds of countries such as Indonesia and South Africa.  ""These positions have done particularly well,"" he said. ""Performance of emerging market local currency debt has been in double digits.""  About 7% of the fund is currently held in cash, higher than its historical average. Wells, pictured, said it was part of the fund's current strategy of ""building up its dry powder"".  Outlook Wells sees a sustained period of volatility ahead but he believes markets will stay ""range bound"".  ""None of the sources of volatility such as fears over China, American interest rate hikes, or Brexit have left us,"" he said.  ""Markets are volatile and they're going to stay volatile.""  Wells intends to use any sell-offs to build on the fund's current strategy of holding income-paying assets.  ""If there are market corrections we will be adding risk and adding to emerging market debt local currency and global high yield. Given that we see markets are being range-bound, we want to build more income into the portfolio.""",0,0,0
61,"Residential Customers Seeing Lower Electric Bills Thanks to NatGas, EIA Says","Residential Customers Seeing Lower Electric Bills Thanks to NatGas, EIA Says Besides helping to lower carbon emissions, the continued growth of cheap natural gas-fired power generation in the United States in 2016 seems to be lowering residential electric bills as well.  Based on data collected through the first half of 2016, U.S. residential electricity prices are trending down for the first time in over a decade, according to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) ""Today in Energy"" note published Thursday.  Through six months ""residential customers paid on average 12.4 cents/kWh, or 0.7% lower than the same period last year,"" EIA wrote. ""If this trend continues for the rest of 2016, annual average residential electricity prices would decline for the first time since 2002. Over the past five years, nominal residential prices have increased an average of 1.9% annually, about the same rate as overall inflation.""  Residential ratepayers ""in most areas of the country are seeing lower retail electricity prices this year compared with the same time last year,"" and the availability of cheap natural gas has been one of the main catalysts, EIA said. ""Over the first six months of 2016, the weighted average cost of natural gas delivered to electricity generators was $2.58/MMBtu, 28% lower than the first half of 2015.""  The New England region, coming off higher retail and wholesale power prices between 2013 and 2014, has seen residential prices fall by 6% through the first six months of 2016, averaging around 19.2 cents/kWh, EIA said. ""Improved supplies of natural gas into the region, along with lower natural gas prices, have contributed to the region's declining retail electricity rates so far in 2016.""  Noting a recent uptick in natural gas prices, EIA said its latest projections expect the average delivered cost of natural gas to be 27% higher in 2H2016 compared to 1H2016, with prices continuing to trend upward in 2017. Consequently, U.S. residential electricity prices are also expected to increase in 2017 by 3%, EIA said.  ""Not all recent declines in electricity prices can be attributed to developments in natural gas markets,"" EIA said. Hawaii, for example, uses petroleum in a number of its generating units, ""and the falling cost of crude oil has contributed to a 12% decline in retail electricity prices so far in 2016.""  After natural gas overtook coal's monthly share of U.S. electric generation for the first time in decades in 2015, power sector demand for gas has continued to increase in 2016 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 2).  The increased role of gas in the power stack has helped drive down greenhouse gas emissions, with U.S. carbon dioxide emissions falling below 2005 levels last year (see Daily GPI, May 9).  Even President Obama on Monday defended the role natural gas and unconventional shale development have played in addressing climate change (see Daily GPI, Oct. 4).

62,Help clients get the most from Medicare: Retirement Scan,"Help clients get the most from Medicare: Retirement Scan Our daily roundup of retirement news your clients may be thinking about.  Medicare recipients: Tips on getting what's yours  Many seniors fail to make the most of Medicare, as they don't understand how the program works, and they make the wrong decisions when choosing the coverage and timing their enrollment, according to this article in USA Today. ""People are used to employer health insurance and are surprised when they need to make all these complicated decisions for themselves when they move to Medicare. There often is no one to help them,"" says the expert. ""Medicare is so needlessly complicated that people often are paralyzed, cannot make a decision and thus do nothing."" One mistake people make is not switching their Medicare plans during the annual open enrollment period, which runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7 each year. Research shows that millions of people could find better coverage at lower cost if they took advantage of this ""terrific do over"" opportunity, an expert said.  How to defuse the tax bomb in your retirement plans  To minimize the tax bite on their savings and maximize after-tax income in retirement, clients may want to use a portion of their traditional IRA to buy a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract, according to this article on Forbes. They may also consider purchasing fixed and variable deferred annuities and investing in stocks, as dividends are taxed at a lower rate or not taxed depending on their tax bracket. Another option is to tap their home equity by applying for a reverse mortgage for tax-free income, or home equity line of credit with a tax-deductible interest.  Should you try to market-time your dollar-cost averaging strategy?  Retirement savers may want to consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy, which requires clients with a fixed amount of funds to follow a certain schedule for investing the money, according to this article on Motley Fool. ""I believe in dollar-cost averaging, rather than just waiting to have a huge lump sum and dumping it in, because what if then the market falls two weeks after that?"" says an expert. ""You've basically treated your entire savings as that one investment, rather than waiting until right after or right before and splitting it in half.""  Using 'brokerage window' to expand 401(k) options  401(k) participants who want to manage their own investments may want to use their employer's brokerage window, which allow employees to choose their investments from a broader menu of individual stocks and mutual funds, according to this article on CNBC. More employers are offering brokerage window to their workers. ""About 15 to 20% of our overall book of plans uses these, but 45 to 50% of the very large firms offer them,"" says an expert with Fidelity. ""The large plans have a level of sophistication from an administrative standpoint. They have educational programs and oversight that allows them to take that responsibility on.""",1,1,0
63,Landlords will face tougher tests from mortgage lenders,"News Landlords will face tougher tests from mortgage lenders Landlords will face tougher stress tests from mortgage lenders next year as the Bank of England attempts to bring the booming buy-to-let sector into line with the rest of the housing market.  For the first time, the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority has implemented regulations that a landlord must meet to be given a mortgage.  The rules have been introduced to ensure landlords do not get into mortgage payment difficulties if interest rates were to climb sharply or if a landlord's income fell sharply.  However, some brokers have criticised the changes, arguing that they are an attack on small landlords who may struggle to pass the affordability tests.  ""This feels like the regulator is looking to, if not prosecute, then certainly rein in the buy-to-let market very, very hard,"" Simon Collins, at the mortgage broker John Charcol, said.  Richard Donnell, research director at the property analyst Hometrack, said that the regulations would require some landlords to find as much as £35,000 more of their own money to receive a mortgage.  Mr Donnell said: ""That's a lot of money. If you take it alongside the extra stamp duty costs for buy-to-let and the tax relief changes, then buy-to-let has gone from being a no-brainer for investors to forcing people to put more money in and minimise the risk. This may mean a slowdown in the buy-to-let market.""  The sector has enjoyed a boom in the past ten years. Some two million people are now private landlords, together renting out five million properties, according to Paragon, a mortgage lender.  Yet the Bank of England has been concerned for some time that the unregulated lending boom was a threat to the economy, arguing that a sudden sell-off of landlords' properties in an economic downturn would have a drastic effect on the housing market.  Landlords have already faced a tough year from regulators. In April, the government introduced an additional 3 per cent stamp duty surcharge on second homes and buy-to-let properties. George Osborne, the former chancellor, also reduced the tax relief landlords will be able to claim on mortgage payments from 2017.  Under the changes from the Bank of England, banks and specialist buy-to-let lenders will also be required to make sure that a landlord could still afford to meet their mortgage repayments if interest rates were to rise to 5.5 per cent over a minimum of five years.  The Bank's financial regulator will also ask lenders to assess whether a borrower's monthly rental income from a property is enough to cover their mortgage payments, or whether the landlord has enough of their own money to be able to keep paying the mortgage. This ratio will be 125 per cent so if a landlord's monthly mortgage costs are £1,000, then the rent they must receive is £1,250 a month.",1,1,0
64,Long-term care delay post-fire frustrates seniors,"News Long-term care delay post-fire frustrates seniors The leadership of Fort McMurray's leading seniors' advocacy group says further delaying a planned longterm care facility during the rebuild ""goes beyond common sense.""  During a Monday meeting of the municipality's Land Planning and Transportation Committee, it was announced development of the long-term care facility was stalled.  Council is willing to commit $10.5 million to the project as soon as the province reaches out to the advisory committee on aging. The municipality is still awaiting a response, and administration says the delay is an example of the wildfire's fallout slowing bureaucracy.  Joan Furber, president of the Golden Years Society, said in May she hoped the project would not be forgotten during the rebuilding process. Now, she says many seniors are back to wondering when any progress on the project will be made.  ""When I read what happened, my mouth jus t dropped,"" she said. ""Is the message that people have to work here for decades then leave town when they're old?  How much of a priority do we have to be?"" Last November, the province announced the long-term care facility planned for Parsons Creek would be moved to Willow Square, the site seniors had said they preferred. Consultation would be held over the next year to influence the design phase.  At the time, the province estimated a four-year wait for a Willow Square facility to open, factoring in time for consultation, design and construction.  ""This is the year they should have been consulting overtime with our community,""  says Tany Yao, Wildrose MLA for Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo. ""We know they have the money for it in the provincial budget, there's no reason why they can't still be doing those meetings with us right now.""  Shortly after the city reopened, Furber says the message from municipal and provincial officials would be that development of Willow Square could be delayed up to a year. She says few seniors had an issue with that and understood the circumstances. Yet, there was still an expectation that consultation would continue in some form.  ""So much has happened in the last few months, we get that things are going to be a little late,"" she says. ""It's just there seems to be an excuse for everything. When I was told things would be slower, and again I understood that, we were also told not to worry.""  The bureaucratic fallout of the wildfire has also delayed construction and consultation for several other capital projects, the committee was told.

65,Keys to keeping lid on spending,"Money Keys to keeping lid on spending Her Money  Each week Fairfax personal finance editor Sally Patten will point out the steps women can take to secure their financial future.  If you are not across your household's financial statements, you should be.  That is the advice of Claire Mackay, an adviser at Quantum Financial.  The reason is simple. ""If you don't know where you spend money, you won't know where you can save."" And why is this so important?  You might think that being wealthy, or at least comfortably off, depends on what you earn, but in fact, argues this financial adviser, there is more to it. Being wealthy depends on how much you spend.  ""My wealthiest clients know exactly where all their money goes,"" Mackay says. She adds that invariably clients can find ways to reduce their spending if they need to, even if it is changing to a cheaper mobile phone plan or reviewing their electricity, gas or insurance arrangements.  There are two things you need to understand about your finances. The first is the so-called balance sheet, which shows what investments you own and how much debt, or borrowings, you have.  The investments might be an investment property, shares, money in a bank account or superannuation savings. The debt you owe might be a mortgage, any debt on your credit cards or other car or personal loans.  The balance sheet part is important when it comes to retirement because you will need to rely on these investments to support you when you are no longer earning a salary.  The other area of your finances that you should be on top of is the day-to-day stuff; in other words, your monthly or annual income and your expenses.  When you think of your salary, don't think about it in gross terms, but the amount you receive after tax and super contributions have been deducted - your net salary.  When calculating your expenses, you should include everything from groceries and your daily coffee bill to your expenditure on rates, entertainment, clothing, car insurance and your telecommunications.  Longer term, the idea is to arrange your income and expenses in such a way to allow you to shift the money you receive via your salary to the investments that appear on the household balance sheet - although in the shorter term the money may be shifted to separate holiday or school fee accounts.  Once you are retired, you won't want to have much debt hanging around, so the idea is to gradually pay down borrowings.  The bottom line is you need to understand your financial position - what is going on in terms of your assets and borrowings, income and expenses. Ultimately you need to know if you are converting income into assets.The information in this article should not be taken as financial advice.

66,How Much Retirement Income Will You Need? Maybe Less Than You Think; New research calls the venerable 80% income-replacement rule into...,"Life How Much Retirement Income Will You Need? Maybe Less Than You Think; New research calls the venerable 80% income-replacement rule into question New research indicates that retirees-especially in higher income brackets-might need to replace less of their pre-retirement income than they think.  Financial planners have long suggested that individuals replace 80% of their income in retirement from various sources to maintain the same standard of living they had while working.  But in a recent article in Research magazine, Michael Finke, a professor at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, notes that the rule doesn't necessarily reflect how a person's income grows while he or she is working-nor how expenses change and even decline in retirement. What's more, the guideline focuses on gross income rather than take-home pay.  Consider: In retirement, you likely no longer contribute to Social Security, Medicare and your retirement account. That means your replacement rate is down to no more than 77% of your final year's salary-or 60% or less if you use average lifetime income, Prof. Finke says.  If you subtract other expenses-commuting and a lower federal income-tax bill (assuming you're in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you were in your working years)-the replacement rate falls lower still.  ""The 80% rule is wrong because it's too simplistic,"" Prof. Finke says. ""Most of us don't want to replace our gross income. We want to replace our paycheck.""  The guideline, he adds, is especially distorted for high-income Americans.  ""The highest 20% of earners aren't even spending half of their gross income,"" he says. ""So if you think they need 80% of their gross income, then they'd have to spend more in retirement than they'd ever spent during their working years-and this doesn't sound like a good life plan.""  So, what's a better way to figure out how much income you need?  First, if you're at, or very near, retirement, you can use your actual target consumption, says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chicago-based fund-research company Morningstar Inc. For those still several years or more from leaving the office, the key is pinpointing what specific expenses will change at retirement and adjusting one's replacement rate accordingly. ""A household that is saving 20% of their pay, for example, in a 401(k) needs to replace a lower percentage of their final pay than one saving only 5% because they are used to living off less,"" Mr. Blanchett says.  Prof. Finke adds: ""Most of the wealthiest retirees don't spend down their money at all. This means that if they didn't want to give it to their kids they could have had a lot more fun when they were younger.""  Mr. Powell is the editor of Retirement Weekly, a service of MarketWatch.com.

67,Health Care on a Budget,"UpFront Health Care on a Budget The impact medical costs will have in retirement.  ""We talk about all aspects of what participants will need in retirement,"" says Michael Woomer, senior vice president of institutional and retirement plan services at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""People basically understand they will be facing health care costs, but they don't understand how big the impact will be, so we tell participants how important it is to save as much as they can.""  A recent report from the National Association of Government Defined Contribution (DC) Administrators estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring today should expect to spend $220,000 on health care over the course of a 20-year retirement. Woomer says the costs could range from $150,000 to $400,000.  It is far more important for plan advisers to discuss health care costs in retirement than it is to talk about lifestyle goals, says Mary McDougall, a Merrill Lynch financial adviser in St. Paul, Minnesota. The premiums and out-of-pocket expenses will range from $10,000 to $20,000 a year, she says. ""The expenses are a lot more than they expect.""  ""I would hope that advisers are not refraining from having this conversation,"" says Scott Laue, a financial adviser with Savant Capital Management in Rockford, Illinois. ""As a certified financial planner [CFP], we are required to disclose both the good and the bad.""  The trend toward high-deductible health care plans paired with health savings accounts (HSAs) is bringing the subject of health care costs-pre- and post-retirement-to the fore, says Shelby George, vice president, adviser services, at Manning & Napier in Rochester, New York. Just like the movement from pensions to defined contribution plans, employers are moving toward high-deductible plans, which put more of the onus on participants, and ""are encouraging advisers to talk about [those coming expenses] more in their education materials.""  Advisers are also increasingly encouraging participants to invest in HSAs. ""This is one area that participants can use to save above and beyond the retirement plan,"" Woomer says.  Even for participants with more than $5 million in liquid assets-the market advised by Frank Migliazzo, managing director, private wealth advisers at Merrill Lynch in Troy, Michigan-health care costs are a concern. Migliazzo notes that Merrill Lynch research has found that, over the last 30 years, health care costs have risen an average of 6 percentage points above inflation each year.  Merrill Lynch has also found that many people will end up in a nursing home, he adds. For 65-year-olds, there is a 15% chance they will need to be placed in a care facility. At age 85, that possibility rises to 55%, and at age 90, it increases to 70%. Migliazzo's clients are also worried about dementia. As a result, many are buying long-term-care insurance.  The report found that Medicare covers 62% of health care costs, but the individual is responsible for the remaining 38%.",1,1,0
68,I'm a first-time buyer confused by mortgage options,"Money I'm a first-time buyer confused by mortgage options I've been offered a few interest rates and wonder how fixing the rates would affect my mortgage  Q I'm currently looking for a mortgage to buy my first house and I'm very confused as there are so many options.  I have a few mortgage advisers offering me interest rates of between 4.8% and 5.2% for a five-year fixed rate. Are these good?  Is it better to fix it for shorter period and pay a lower interest rate? If I fix it for two years, will the interest rate go up? AP  A On the face of it, those interest rates seem pretty high especially given the fact that we've been enjoying several months of record low fixed interest rates.  Even if you got a mortgage of 90% of the value of a property, financial firm Moneyfacts says you could get a five-year fixed rate of 3.39% from Yorkshire Bank and a slightly higher 3.79% from Post Office Money. These are both a lot lower than the rates that you have been quoted.  However, if the figures of 4.8% and 5.2% that you have given are annual percentage rates (APR), they don't seem so bad. The APR gives you a way of comparing mortgage deals which takes into account all the costs of the mortgage including fees as well as the mortgage interest rate and the rate that the mortgage will revert to once the fixed rate is over. The APR for the Yorkshire Bank deal - which has an arrangement fee of £999 - is 4.5% while the APR on the Post Office Money offering - which has no fee - is 4.3%.  You are right in thinking that you'll be charged a lower rate of interest if you fix for a shorter amount of time. Again with a 90% mortgage, if you fixed for just two years, you would pay 2.39% with the Yorkshire Bank and 2.49% at the Loughborough building society.  The APRs are higher at 4.6% and 4.7% respectively, and if you only fix for two years you may have to pay a fee for a new deal afterwards, so the overall cost could be cheaper on a five-year deal.  Going for the shorter fix doesn't make it more likely that the interest rate will go up. Interest rates will go up or down whether you fix for two years or five. The question you need to ask yourself is whether you want the certainty of knowing that your mortgage payments won't change for five years or whether you are happy to take a gamble that interest rates generally won't have risen - as they are generally predicted to do - by too much in two years' time.

69,Second Cup outlines 3-year turnaround plan amid $26.2M loss,"Investing Second Cup outlines 3-year turnaround plan amid $26.2M loss TORONTO - Second Cup Ltd. had a $26.2 million loss in the third quarter, as the embattled specialty coffee company booked provisions for cafe closures and the impairment of its asset values.  The loss amounted to $2.65 per share, mostly due to a $25.7-million item that reflects the reduced value of Second Cup's trademarks.  On an adjusted basis, Second Cup's operations had a reduced profit of four cents per share - down about 64% from last year's third quarter when adjusted earnings were 11 cents per share.  Second Cup also announced Monday that it plans to raise up to $5 million this month through a private placement of its stock, as part of a three-year plan to revitalize the Canadian specialty retailer's network of cafes and its brand.  At the end of the third quarter there were 349 Second Cup cafes, two less than a year earlier and eight fewer than at the beginning of the quarter.  Systemwide sales for the 13 weeks ended Sept. 27 fell about $1.3 million from a year earlier, dropping to $43.6 million from $44.9 million, but Second Cup's own revenue increased to nearly $6.7 million from just under $6.3 million.  Second Cup has been faced with increased competition in recent years from high-end coffee retailers such as Seattle-based Starbucks and major restaurant chains such as Tim Hortons and McDonald's.  The Mississauga-based franchise company has been working for months to recover its position in the Canadian market, hiring Alix Box - who has held senior positions at Holt Renfrew and Starbucks - as its chief executive in February.  ""Fiscal 2014 has been a year of transition,"" Box said in a statement Monday. ""While much remains to be done, we are now fully engaged in the process of transformation to restore Second Cup to a place of leadership and greater profitability.""  Following the end of the quarter, Second Cup announced its intention to acquire 16 cafes in Toronto locations from Debbie and Bob Riche, two long-time franchisees.  The company says it plans to open a new ""cafe of the future"" in Toronto and a flagship cafe in Montreal in the coming weeks.  In a related announcement Monday, the company said it's aiming to grow annualized system sales by about $50 million to $234 million in 2017, turn same-store sales positive by late 2015, and have earnings exceeding 50 to 60 cents per share by 2017.  ""Our plan for the future is ambitious,"" said Michael Bregman, Second Cup's chairman. ""While there are no assurances, our Board of Directors is highly confident that Second Cup will be restored to a position of leadership with significant potential for value creation.""  All the directors intend to participate in a stock issue, and collectively acquire between 40 and 60% of the $5 million worth of equity that Second Cup plans to offer.",0,0,0

71,Will apathy risks family losing their inheritance,"Will apathy risks family losing their inheritance TWO-THIRDS of adults have not made enough provision for their legacy to be left to whom they choose, according to a wills and probate specialist.  One in four over-65s are still to make a will [GETTY/ picture posed by model]  Research from the Co-operative Legal Services also found one in four over-65s are still to make a will.   These individuals risk losing control of their estate and their final wishes for savings, assets and investments not being met.   These findings come as the rules of intestacy, which decree what happens to a person's estate if they die with no valid will in place, today change for the first time since 1925.  Experts say the new rules should simplify how an estate is distributed in the event someone dies without having the right paperwork in place but they also serve as a timely reminder of the importance of drawing up and maintaining a will.   The key differences include changes for couples who are married or in a civil partnership. They will now inherit the entire estate if a partner dies without a will and they have no children or other descendants.   However, this change does not apply to unmarried couples who will not automatically have rights to an estate if a partner dies without a will.   Other moves include changes to the inheritance of an estate for married couples of civil partners with children and protection for children adopted after the death of a parent. Under old rules there was a risk children in this situation would lose their inheritance but under the new rules, a child of the deceased can inherit on intestacy even if they're subsequently adopted.   ""It's pleasing that rule changes have simplified matters but if a person dies without a valid will in place, they still have no control over what happens to their estate,"" warns James Antoniou, head of wills for the CLS.   ""To ensure your estate goes to those you want, it's crucial you have a will."" Andrew Caplen of the Law Society agrees that the rule changes serve as a reminder of the importance of a will.   ""If you have no will it means your final wishes may go unheeded and a financial and emotional mess is left for your loved ones to sort out,"" he said.   If you want to make a will it is worth noting that anyone can set themselves up as a will-writer.   ""It is important that people are able to distinguish between those who are unregulated, uninsured and untrained and trained solicitors who specialise in this area,"" added Caplen.   To find a registered solicitor that specialises in wills and probate visit Solicitors.LawSociety.org.uk.

72,New report reveals older worker hotspots and the vast differences in employment prospects for over 50s around the country,"News New report reveals older worker hotspots and the vast differences in employment prospects for over 50s around the country Watford, Dorset and the Shetland Islands are leading the charge against 'outdated' older worker stereotypes, a Government report revealed today.  According the figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions, Watford has the highest rate of employment among older workers, with nine out of 10 people aged 50-64 in work.  In the Shetlands this rate is 88 per cent while in north Dorset it's 87 per cent, closely followed by Stroud in Gloucestershire and Horsham in Sussex.  DWP minister Steve Webb said: 'The business case for ignoring outdated and inaccurate stereotypes and giving older workers a chance to thrive is absolutely compelling, and these figures  show that in some parts of the country that message is being received loud and clear.  'What we must do now is extend the positive record we're seeing in counties like Hertfordshire across the whole of the UK.'  But the report also highlighted a number of employment blackspots for older workers.  Almost half of people aged 50-64 were unemployed in Hyndburn and Rossendale in Lancashire, 50 per cent in London's Tower Hamlets, and 51 per cent in Barrow-in-Furness.  'JOB PROSPECTS FOR YOUNG ARE IMPROVING'  Two-thirds of employers have hired a young person in the past year, according to a survey of 600 employers.  The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said this positive outlook is set to continue for the rest of the year, with employers focussing more on candidate's attitude rather than exam results.  Rec chief executive Kevin Green said: 'It's the best time in six years to be a young person coming into the jobs market.'  This resonates with data released by the Office for National Statistics last week suggesting that ageism in the workplace is still rife.  Unemployment as a whole fell to 6.4 per cent last quarter and the number of unemployed people aged 16-49 fell 18.8 per cent since May 2010, compared to just 5.3 per cent for those aged 50-64.  Dr Ros Altmann, the former director general of Saga, who was appointed last month as the Government's Business Champion for Older Workers, said more needed to be done to help people in this age group, such as offering apprentice schemes.  'It does seem there remains latent ageism in the labour market,' she said. 'Not enough is being done to help these people back to work and overcome ageist attitudes.'  And with retirement at the age of 65 looking increasingly unfeasible for most workers, employment equality is essential if they're to top up their dwindling pension pot.  Steve Webb added: 'Another crucial point is that a person dropping out of the workforce early can have a devastating effect on their retirement income. We owe it to people to do everything possible to ensure they can benefit from a full working life.'",1,1,0
73,Drive a hard bargain; HAVE PASSPORT WILL TRAVEL Jeremy Gates rounds up all the latest travel news,"Features Drive a hard bargain; HAVE PASSPORT WILL TRAVEL Jeremy Gates rounds up all the latest travel news TEMPERATURES are already falling in the Alps and if you want the price of your 2013/14 season ski holiday to fall too, driving to the slopes could be one easy solution.  With airlines ever-keen to slap hefty charges on extra baggage (something that is inevitable with a ski holiday) travelling by car could save families hundreds of pounds. Stuart McLeod of Zenith Holidays, an operator catering for 'savvy' skiers, explains: ""This winter, we are seeing a significant increase in the number of people driving families to the slopes to cut costs. If we include free Channel ferry crossings, driving down to the Alps saves about £450 for a family of four, as opposed to flying and paying extra on baggage at check-in.""  At lesser-known French resorts like St Jean Montclar and Les 7 Laux, for example, a family of four could enjoy a self-catering apartment with Channel crossings and lift pass from around a total £920 per week - or about £1,290 if they chose a four-star apartment with access to a pool (about £324 each).  McLeod says many skiers will also catch trains to the ski resorts this winter - some on Eurostar, and some catching trains direct to the Alps. These trains leave Paris at 10pm on Friday nights and arrive on the slopes next morning, allowing skiers to sleep on the train then grab an extra day's skiing on the Saturday, a day which would otherwise be lost waiting around at airports.  Of course, not everyone can face the long car or rail trek across France, especially if you live further north, and for this reason Monarch Airlines has flights of barely two hours from Manchester, Gatwick and various regional airports into Italy, Spain, Germany and Austria. Monarch one-way flights into Munich, from Leeds Bradford, Luton and Manchester start at £39.99 (£83.98 return) with transfers to the resort of Kitzbuhel taking 90 minutes. Fares to Grenoble, from Birmingham, Leeds Bradford, Gatwick and Manchester start at £44.99 one way (£91.98 return) with transfers of two hours and 45 minutes to Val d'Isere. There is more good news from the big operators too, keen to secure early sales at discounted prices to avoid the risk of bigger discounts nearer departure date. For example, Crystal Ski, which covers 136 ski resorts in Europe, North America, Japan and Russia with regional departures from all major UK airports, offers a 'buy one and get one half price' deal on lift passes - saving up to £177. It applies on bookings by October 21 for departures between January 4 and February 9.  Driving to your ski holiday can save you money.  At Ski Solutions, deals include savings on accommodation in Whistler, free lift passes and discounts in Verbier and four-night all-inclusive breaks at Isola 2000, from £575 includes return flights ex-Gatwick December 12.",0,0,0
74,A brighter future is now within reach; Workplace pensions Advertising Feature,"Features A brighter future is now within reach; Workplace pensions Advertising Feature LIFE is full of surprises, and here's one - you can improve your financial future without doing a thing!  Millions of working people are discovering the benefits of a workplace pension. This could include you if you're employed, aged 22 or over, and earn at least £9,440 a year.  The law has changed so your boss has to enrol you into a pension scheme automatically, without you doing a thing!  It's great news if you don't have a head for figures or worry about making the wrong choices with your money.  If you've never thought about having a workplace pension before, it might sound complicated.  But it's really a simple save-as-you-go system. Here's how it works: Your employer will write to you, so look out for this letter, which will give you more details about your workplace pension scheme and what it means for you.  Your boss will then automatically enrol you into the scheme. Once you've been enrolled, a small percentage of your salary will go straight into your pension pot.  Your boss will pay in as well - that's EXTRA money that you wouldn't otherwise get. The government will give you tax relief, too.  All three contributors - you, your employer and the government - will continue to pay into your pension pot regularly.  Your pot will grow over time and when you retire, you will be able to use it to buy a regular income for the rest of your life.  You will have the chance to opt out of your workplace pension, but, before you do, here are some things to think about: The current State Pension is £110.15 per week for a single person. It's a great foundation, but saving through a workplace pension will give you more money to spend in retirement.  Unlike other types of saving, you won't be the only person paying in. Your employer and the government will contribute too - that's not something you get with your ISA or savings account.  This isn't just happening to you - more than a million people have already been enrolled into a workplace pension in the past year. Don''t be the one to miss out!  This change started with the biggest companies first but will affect all businesses over the next few years.  Staying in a workplace pension could be the best decision you ever make. ?

75,Charge Cards vs. Debit Cards,"Charge Cards vs. Debit Cards Not all plastic cards are created equal.  When discussing the kind of credit that comes with a plastic card, the first distinction to make is between charge cards and credit cards. American Express Green Card and Gold Card and Diners Club Charge Card are charge cards that require you to pay your bill in full each billing cycle. Most credit cards (including some offered by companies that also issue charge cards) don't necessarily encourage you to pay your bill in full because they profit by charging interest -- lots of interest -- on the unpaid balance.  Charge cards. Travel and entertainment cards, such as American Express and Diners Club, are charge cards, not credit cards. You are expected to pay their bills in full within a specified time period. If you don't, you'll be penalized.  Membership fees for charge cards are higher than for bank-issued cards, and the kinds of service they offer -- an annual accounting of charges, traveler's checks, cash in an emergency -- are commonly available with credit cards, too, especially gold or platinum cards.  You may be able to get a bigger credit line with a charge card, but they're not as widely accepted as Visa or MasterCard.  Debit cards. A debit card appears to work the same way as a credit card: The merchant runs it through a little machine and off you go without any cash actually changing hands. But that's where the similarity ends. When you use a debit card, the amount of your purchase is deducted from your checking account or some other account you have designated. It's useful to think of a debit card as a paperless check that clears immediately, with no grace period, or ""float.""  If you're not paying close attention, you may find yourself carrying a debit card from your bank that you think is a credit card. That mistake usually lasts no longer than the arrival of your first bank statement showing your depleted balance.  The main use for debit cards used to be to get cash from automated teller machines, but devices known as point of sale terminals have been installed in an increasing number of retail outlets. Beginning in August (July for new accounts), your bank will ask if you want to opt-in for overdraft protection. If you don't, your transaction will be declined. This will also occur at the ATM.  Two key facts to remember about debit cards:  Although they look like credit cards, they aren't.  Safeguards against loss or theft and unauthorized use of your card aren't as strict as they are with credit cards. By law, you're liable for the same $50 as with a credit card, but only if you report an unauthorized transaction within two business days of discovering it. Miss that deadline and you're legally responsible for up to $500. But MasterCard and Visa will waive it entirely in many cases.  Copyright 2013 The Kiplinger Washington Editors",1,0,1
76,New house sales build,"Property New house sales build Signs of growth in new housing sales have emerged in NSW and Western Australia, the states with the biggest house price gains.  Nationally, new housing sales rose 3.4 per cent after a 4.7 per cent decrease in July, the Housing Industry Association's seasonally adjusted figures, released on Tuesday, show.  However, new apartment sales fell 11.2 per cent across the country after new units sales eased in NSW and Victoria.  ""It is no coincidence that the states where we've seen rises in new detached house sales are where we've seen the most price growth,"" HIA chief economist Harley Dale said.  New home sales were up 10.2 per cent in August for Western Australia and 7.4 per cent in NSW. South Australia also performed strongly, recording an 8.2 per cent increase.  Dr Dale said recovery was under way in those two states but overall sales were trending sideways when Sydney and Perth were not included in the figures.  In Queensland, where new house sales inched up at 3.6 per cent, a housing recovery will not be as rapid.  ""It will be challenging and take time to gather momentum; it will be a grinding recovery in Queensland,"" he said.  In Victoria, new house sales fell 2.4 per cent.  Dr Dale said he expected further declines this financial year, as the state was still coming off peak growth in new home and apartment sales in 2010.  Improvements in Sydney have been seen in the housing and apartment market. However, there were fewer new unit sales in August.  Across the industry, builders and developers have noted an overall improvement in sentiment and inquiry levels.  Home builder Metricon chief executive Mario Biasin said sales had improved in NSW, Queensland and South Australia but off very low bases.High demand expected to continue  He said regional Victoria was performing well but metropolitan Melbourne remained quiet.  ""We're seeing more investors than first-home buyers at the moment, and people wanting to upgrade. More people are building now that they feel confident in selling their existing home,"" he said.  Years of under-supply in Sydney's land market, coupled with strong population growth and low interest rates, are fuelling the market.  Cameron Holt, chief executive of Investa's house and land arm, said the biggest challenge was maintaining the supply to the hungry Sydney market.  The unlisted land development arm of Investa Property Group has reported an increase in demand, particularly on Sydney's fringe.  Mr Holt said demand had been high over the past six months, and he expected that to continue.  Medium and high-density projects continue to sell strongly in Sydney, such as Australand's Metro project at Wolli Creek, where 55 of the 70 apartments sold at the September launch.  CBA economists said while low interest rates are not showing up in retail trade data, the housing figures suggest lower rates are having a significant effect on the housing market.",0,1,1
77,Bonds Gain As Shutdown Intensifies Debt-Ceiling Fears -- Barron's Blog,"Bonds Gain As Shutdown Intensifies Debt-Ceiling Fears -- Barron's Blog (This story has been posted on Barron's Online's Income Investing blog at http://blogs.barrons.com/incomeinvesting/)  By Michael Aneiro  Financial markets seemed cool with the whole government-shutdown thing yesterday but they're not so happy about it today, and that's pushing bonds higher. The ten-year Treasury note is up 14/32 in price to yield 2.594%, per Tradeweb data, and the 30-year bond is up 26/32 to yield 3.674%.  Of course, what everyone's really worried about is the upcoming debt-ceiling negotiations, and whether the government can patch up its current, comparatively minor problems in time to address this much bigger potential problem of causing the U.S. to default on its debt. Here's Deutsche Bank today:  On balance we expect moderate risk-off dynamics until resolution of both the budget impasse and the debt ceiling. The probability of even a technical default is extremely low, but the potential costs are very high. But in either event we expect the uncertainty to provide a short term tailwind to a consolidation of the summer's sell-off. We remain comfortable with our year end forecast for 2.5% Treasuries, but a more acute scare in the budget and debt ceiling process could push yields still lower in the short run.  And here's Peter Tchir of TF Market Advisors, underscoring what a calamity the debt-ceiling debacle would become if it led to a U.S. default by saying that it ain't gonna happen:  There will NOT be a default on U.S. Treasury debt. It won't happen because it has the potential to spin out of control. Even something that is ""technical"" and ""temporary"" could have ramifications for the market that no one will be willing to risk....  No matter what, we will pay our debts. Whether congress roles it weekly for a period of time, or we get a bigger solution, or the Treasury finds a way to pay people what is owed, the debt will be paid.  The potential consequences of not paying it are too great. It isn't simple and at some point the majority of politicians will listen to people like Bill Gross and understand that the dangers of not paying are just too stupid to take. The system is too complex and at its heart is the understanding that treasuries are highly rated and always pay. Breaking that taboo opens too many possible scenarios for no good reason. This is after all debt and payment obligations that we have encumbered ourselves with through law, and should be paid.  I would never bet against the incompetence of Congress, but I am willing to bet against them being completely idiotic and acting with gross negligence, which is what it would take to trigger default on Treasury bonds.

78,"Why divorce is bad for a man's health: Separation increases the risk of early death, substance abuse, suicide and depression","Health Why divorce is bad for a man's health: Separation increases the risk of early death, substance abuse, suicide and depression * The impact of divorce on men's health 'needs urgent investigation'  * Divorced men are more likely to have heart disease, high blood pressure and strokes than married ones - are also 39% more likely to commit suicide  * They are more likely to take part in risky activities which also increases their mortality rate  Divorce might leave some with a broken heart but it also causes real health problems for men, according to researchers.  Those whose marriages end have higher rates of mortality, substance abuse and depression and often lack social support, a study found.  It called for doctors to refer more male divorcees to therapists and said more work is 'urgently needed' to investigate the damaging effects of relationship break-ups on their health.  American researchers say that divorced and single men have a 39 per cent higher suicide rate than their married counterparts - perhaps in part because they are more likely to engage in risky behaviour.  The study, published in the Journal of Men's Health, calls for doctors to refer more men to therapists.  A case study by Dr Daniel Felix, of the University of Nebraska, said health professionals must recognise 'divorce related health problems' in men.  His research centred on a 45-year-old white man who 'endured a difficult divorce'.  He visited his family doctor for the first time in ten years complaining of bad sleep and persistent abdominal pain.  The man revealed he drank 'about a six-pack of beer a day,' had recently begun hating his job in middle management at a local bank and had become irritated with his colleagues and boss.  He eventually reported having limited access to his children and paying a 'significant amount of child support'.  The man also said his ex-wife 'took all our friends with her after the divorce'.  The researchers reported the man's physical condition as 'unremarkable' apart from having a slightly enlarged liver and being somewhat overweight.  They instead attributed his mild physical ailments and seemingly mild depressive state to continued anxiety and stress associated with his divorce.  As a result, the researchers warn doctors about treating ailments that have a psychological basis in divorce.  Instead, they recommend nutrition, exercise and sleep education.  They also urge medical professionals to refer men to alcohol and substance abuse treatment programmes, counsellors or other mental health professionals or divorce support groups.  Professor Ridwan Shabsigh, of Cornell University in the U.S. and president of the International Society of Men's Health, said: 'Popular perception, and many cultures as well as the media, present men as tough, resilient, and less vulnerable to psychological trauma than women.  'The fact is men get affected substantially by psychological trauma and negative life events such as divorce, bankruptcy, war and bereavement.

A report by Bristol University and the International Longevity Centre (ILC-UK) found that about two-fifths (40%) of people aged 75 and over and who still have a mortgage to pay off have an interest only mortgage with no linked investment with which to pay their loan back. This figure dropped to just 6% for people aged between 50 and 54 who still have a mortgage.  Interest-only mortgages, which allow borrowers to pay off the capital only when the mortgage term ends, have become much more thin on the ground since the boom years amid concerns about people not being able to pay back their debt.  Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that home owners have been failing to put enough money aside on up to half of the 2.6 million interest-only mortgages which are due for repayment over the next 30 years.  Mortgage lenders recently agreed to alert their most at-risk customers to help them avoid ""payment shocks''. Some borrowers could end up having to sell their home to pay the loan back if they do not take stronger control of their repayment planning.  The Bristol University/ILC-UK research found that nearly one in 10 (9%) households headed by someone aged in their late 60s still had a mortgage to pay off, as did one in 50 (2%) of people aged over 80.  Among everyone aged over 50 with an outstanding mortgage, the average amount still owed was £62,200. Among the over 75s, the average amount outstanding was £30,900.  At least 14% of older mortgaged households had taken on a new home loan or extended their mortgage in the last couple of years, the report found.  The research was based on the Office for National Statistics' Wealth and Assets Survey, which looked at the economic wellbeing of households.  Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange Debt Charity, said: ""Today's report further highlights the potentially serious problems faced by older people with interest only mortgages.  ""It is now essential that lenders show forbearance and work with customers to establish suitable options to prevent people from losing their homes in retirement.""  Andrea Finney of Bristol University's Personal Finance Research Centre, said: ""These new findings highlight a core of households whose mortgages have persisted into older age.""  She said the report raises important questions about the financial security of these households as they approach later life.  David Sinclair, assistant director of policy and communications at ILC-UK said: ""We are seeing a worrying picture emerge of older people with unlinked interest only mortgages.  ""As the FCA and industry communicates with people with unlinked interest only mortgages, it should evaluate whether any specific targeting of information and advice is necessary for older people.""  ends",1,1,0
80,Don't be afraid to ask the difficult questions that come with retirement planning,"News Don't be afraid to ask the difficult questions that come with retirement planning Planning for retirement can be overwhelming. It requires thinking about long-term goals and it forces consideration of a more sensitive subject -- one's own mortality.  An RBC study reports that only 52% of Canadian boomers actually put a plan on paper despite understanding its importance. However, they worry about it. According to a recent Investors Group survey, financial concerns affect 32% of Canadian couples and 60% of them put retirement savings worries at the top of the list.  For many Canadians, a sense of futility comes from thinking ""I'll never be able to save enough money."" They might be influenced by the old rule of thumb that suggests 70% of pre-retirement income is needed to maintain a current standard of living.  However, some experts like Fred Vettese, the chief actuary of Morneau Shepell, believe that figure is far too high.  Determining the right figure starts with analysis. Cash flow models should be performed, accounting for such factors as lump sum cash needs for special events, future inflation and debt reduction.  To help with that process, the government of Canada has created an excellent Canadian Retirement Income Calculator that takes into account such things as CPP, pensions, RRSPs and other sources of income like annuities.  Once income goals have been set, an analysis should be done to determine the income sources. For most people, a substantial portion will be drawn from investment portfolios. As retirement nears, these portfolios should be prepared for the transition and structured to replace employment income. This generally translates into a more significant weighting in fixed income as well as other investments that provide a regular income stream, such as high quality dividend-paying investments.  Good retirement income plans will also make use of guaranteed income sources that guard against volatile markets and inflation erosion. These include government benefits, available pension income and annuities.  Proper retirement planning goes beyond the management of the retirement portfolio. Estate planning also enters the picture, both from the perspective of how the money will be distributed to heirs but also to more sensitive personal issues. Often there is concern over the future management of the estate by the heirs who may not be competent with finances or are simply not ready to handle a large inheritance.  Canadians want to retire with sufficient income to carry them through and, hopefully, with enough to leave something for their children. However, if they allow themselves to be overwhelmed in angst over an unattainable figure that is both too high and inaccurate, they will never be motivated to begin saving. Determining the right number takes time, but the time is well spent.  -Kim Inglis, CIM, PFP, FCSI, AIFP is an Investment Adviser and Portfolio Manager with Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, a division of Canaccord Genuity Corp., Member -Canadian Investor Protection Fund. www.reynoldsinglis.ca.

81,A fund of one,"A fund of one How one US pension plan is revising the definition of a 'commingled' fund to speed up investment  Finding ways of investing faster appears to be rife among US pension plans at the minute. Note last month's procedural shift by the Nebraska Investment Council, which removed the need for board approval for certain repeat commitments. The reasoning for the expedited process was to better enable the pension system to invest in vehicles prior to the first close, when better fees and terms are sometimes offered. If you ever wanted an indicator of how hot the US real estate market has become, measures likes these are surely one.  In addition, since the Nebraska case came to light, another one has cropped up. As PERE reported this week, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) has made a $100 million commitment to CityView Bay Area II.  This might seem like a run-of-the-mill commitment to a commingled fund. Indeed, that is what LACERA calls it. However, upon closer inspection, it much more closely resembles a separate account. There is only one limited partner, LACERA, and the pension plan has complete control over areas such as general partner termination, fund extensions and cessation of investment period. It also has retained the right to own the projects outright upon completion as long-term core assets and already has drawn up a true separate account management agreement with CityView to be used if and when it acquires full interests.  So, why hasn't LACERA just committed to a separate account rather than what it technically defines as commingled fund? The answer is the need for speed.  If LACERA had made this commitment as a separate account, it would first have had to go through a time-consuming request for proposal (RFP) process that typically requires six to nine months to complete. However, it doesn't want to miss out on opportunities now.  Still, there is no 'legal' definition for what constitutes a commingled fund. In addition, unlike some investors, LACERA does not have a limit on the percentage of a commingled fund that its investment can represent.  It's also important to note that not all state pension plans are subject to RFP processes for separate account managers or other real estate hires One large public pension that PERE spoke with has made its multiple separate account manager hires without putting mandates out for public bid. For LACERA, the need to engage in an RFP process becomes an additional hurdle and potentially puts it at a competitive disadvantage. This unique fund structure is one way for the pension plan to level the playing field without breaking the rules.  Of course, not all pension funds in the US will be following suit in finding ways to expedite the investment process. However, with the US market appearing so hot right now and investors not wishing to be too late to opportunities, one can expect more pension plans to find ways to be more nimble.",0,0,0
82,Compulsory pension for West workers,"News Compulsory pension for West workers Around 677,000 workers in the South West will automatically pay into a company pension under Government plans to avert mass hardship in retirement.  From October 1, staff working for large firms and not currently in a workplace scheme will see pay reduced by 1%, with the cash placed into savings and matched by the employer.  The move will affect people earning more than the income tax threshold, which is currently £8,105. Small firms will not be involved until June 2015 at the earliest.  In the greater South West, just 41% of private sector workers, or 471,000 people, make payments into a workplace pension scheme. The figure has fallen sharply since 2002, when 57% paid into a company scheme.  The number of private sector workers paying into pension schemes has plummeted to its lowest level since records began in 1953.  Around nine-in-ten public sector workers have a staterun scheme, meaning the reform will largely affect the private sector.  The automatic enrolment scheme, which has been described as the biggest pensions shake-up in more than a century, aims to tackle concerns about a growing old age poverty crisis, as people are living for longer but failing to put away enough for their later years.  Workers can choose to opt out of the scheme once they have been enrolled under ""soft compulsion"". The Government believes less than onethird will opt-out. Employers will eventually contribute 3% of earnings, individuals 4% of earnings, and there will also be 1% from the Government to make up a total contribution of 8%.  Pensions Minister Steve Webb told the Western Morning News: ""We've got millions and millions of people who don't have a pension, so when they retire they will get a pension from the state and not much else. They will be on a very low standard of living in retirement. ""If we do nothing, fewer and fewer people will have a workbased pensions and will retire into poverty. We can't really think of any other way of enabling these millions of workers to retire with a decent standard of living. We could force them to save, which reduces the freedom of choice. We could tax everybody and have a much higher state pension.  This seems to us the right balance.""  Asked whether the timing was inconvenient as Britain remains in recession and households are struggling to pay bills, he said: ""There's never a great time to do this. It's already been delayed quite significantly. It's been talked about for years and years.""  Anne Marie Morris, Conservative MP for Newton Abbot, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Micro Businesses, said she was pleased so many South West workers would be paying into a pension. But she added: ""It is important that our small and micro businesses receive the help they will need to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits auto-enrolment will bring.""",1,1,0
83,Three Tips For Building A Lasting Retirement,"Three Tips For Building A Lasting Retirement MILWAUKEE, Sept. 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Retirement planning is constantly changing making it necessary to have a solid retirement strategy. In the past, many could rely on pension plans and social security benefits, but pension plans are increasingly rare(1) and Social Security benefits should not be used as a sole source of retirement.  Many Americans are at risk of running out of money in retirement. According to a recent Employee Benefit Research Institute study (EBRI), nearly 47 percent of early baby boomers (ages 56 to 62) are at risk of outliving their retirement savings. ""To develop a sustainable strategy that meets your specific needs, some important considerations would be your age at retirement, life expectancy, living expenses and the rate of return you expect from your investments,"" said Dean Urbanski, Vice President, BMO Harris Financial Advisors, Inc., a part of BMO Financial Group.  Here are a few tips from Urbanksi on planning for retirement.      -- Withdrawal Strategy: Knowing how much money should be withdrawn from your        retirement savings each year is a critical factor in building a        retirement plan. Withdraw too much and you are likely to outlive your        assets; take too little and you may unnecessarily sacrifice your standard        of living, especially in the early years of retirement.       -- Asset Allocation: As individuals seek increased income upon entering        retirement, they often shift their holdings more toward bonds and cash.        This may or may not be a good move, as there are other key investment        considerations beyond having a need for income. Confer with your        financial advisor to determine the appropriate allocation for your needs,        investment objective, risk profile and timeframe.       -- A core of guaranteed income: In retirement your focus will need to shift        to using your savings to generate income to meet your ongoing expenses.        One possible option is to allocate a portion of your savings to an        annuity. Annuities are an investment tool that can provide guaranteed        income for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live.   Said Urbanksi, ""Whatever your specific plans, it's crucial that you enter retirement with a strategy for turning your savings into a retirement 'paycheck' that will allow you to live retirement on your own terms.""

Awarded Contract with State of North Carolina OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Sept. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- After a transparent and highly competitive bid process, the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees awarded benefits administration contracts to five companies, including Kansas City-based COBRAGuard. The state provides benefits for approximately 664,000 people. With this decision, it expects to save $22.4 million, roughly 19 percent, compared to last year.  COBRAGuard will take over as the state's new COBRA administration partner effective July 1, 2013, and will serve for a contracted term of three and a half years. The company will provide a full range of COBRA administration and direct billing services. The contract is valued at approximately $1.2 million annually.  ""We are delighted to be chosen as North Carolina's COBRA administration partner,"" COBRAGuard President Robert Meyers said. ""Our goal is to help the state save time and operate efficiently, while delivering exceptional service and secure online account access for COBRA participants. The state was able to drive down costs by splitting the administration contract between several highly efficient, niche-focused companies. Other public entities should consider North Carolina's innovative strategy.""  COBRAGuard has a long history of successfully serving public entities. The company serves more than 1,000 cities, counties, municipalities, school districts and universities across the nation, with the addition of North Carolina. In 2011, the company announced the formation of a public entity division. Meyers serves as a councilman for the city of Roeland Park, Kan., so he has firsthand understanding of public entity challenges and a unique desire to help them thrive. ""At COBRAGuard, we don't see ourselves as vendors,"" Meyers said. ""We are highly engaged and adaptable problem solvers who extend the capabilities of the organizations we serve.""  Outsourcing benefit management is becoming more common, said Jan White, president of the Society for Human Resource Management of Greater Kansas City. White also is HR director for the Visiting Nurse Association of Kansas City. ""COBRA is just one of those regulations that a lot of people find cumbersome to manage, and if you can outsource it, that frees you up for other tasks,"" White said in the September 7 edition of the Kansas City Business Journal.  ""Public and private organizations understand that it's inefficient to continuously invest in the training, legal review and documentation needed to properly administer COBRA,"" Meyers said.

85,"California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform","News; News California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a hotly contested pension reform bill whose impact on public employees may signal a new era in DB and health care coverage nationwide.  Reuters notes that Brown's new legislation will raise the minimum retirement ages for many public employees as well as reducing pension benefits for all new workers.  ""Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system,"" Brown said, in a statement. The law, he adds, is the ""biggest rollback to public pensions in the history of California pensions.""  California's new rules come admit tremendous economic and political pressure to curtail the escalating costs of DB plans and post-retirement benefits for public employees, both in that state and across the U.S.  But California's pressures have been stronger, with several major cities claiming or teetering on the verge of bankrupcy as they find it impossible to meet their pension obligations, in part due to long-term national economic issues.  The state's two biggest pension funds, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, are at least $165 million underfunded.  And normally left-leaning, worker-friendly cities including San Jose and San Diego have also joined the fray, with voters supporting measures to limit pension benefits for existing workers and retirees and drastically reduce services to new hires - votes which are being contested in court by public safety employee unions.  Under Brown's new legistlation, new hires will evenly split payments to their pension accounts with their employers, and other government employers will have more leverage to ask the same of current employees, upping their required contributions. Park rangers, game wardens and firefighters will now have to pay more of their own benefits.  The legislation also launches new formulas for calculating future pension benefits for new employees.  As a spin-off to the pension legislation, Moody's Investors Service said the action will go far to increasing California's overall credit rating, currently listed as A1.  The Associated Press notes that the bill did not include a hybrid-styled system Brown had championed which would add a 401(k)-style system so public employees would bear some of the investment risk, as private-sector workers do.  As well, nothing was done to contain the health care costs promised to retiring workers, and there are still no indendent members with financial experties on the board of the state's main pension fund.  ""Yes, it's not everything. It's not perfection,"" Brown told reporters in Los Angeles. ""But in politics we don't deal with perfection. These are hard fought. These aren't that easy.""  California's public employees' system estimates the changes will save between $42 billion and $50 billion over 30 years, while the teachers' system estimated its savings at $22.7 billion over 30 years.",1,0,1
86,"Banking, Financial Services; Prudential reports higher rate taxpayers reject (GBP)438 million in tax relief","Banking, Financial Services; Prudential reports higher rate taxpayers reject (GBP)438 million in tax relief 2012 SEP 8 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News -- One in four higher rate taxpayers do not contribute to pension schemes despite the attraction of tax relief to help boost their retirement savings, according to independent research from Prudential*. Nationally, this equates to around 216,000 employees missing out on up to (GBP)438 million a year in pension tax relief.  The nationwide study of those earning between (GBP)42,275 and (GBP)149,999 found 21 per cent claiming they cannot afford to contribute to a pension scheme. One in eight (13 per cent) say they do not see the point of saving for retirement, despite the tax benefits of pensions, while 17 per cent don't know why they fail to save into a pension scheme.  An average higher rate taxpayer contributing (GBP)425 a month into a pension fund receives basic rate tax relief of (GBP)85 a month or (GBP)1,020 a year, directly into their pension fund. Up to an additional (GBP)1,020 a year in higher rate tax relief can be claimed, which could also be used for pension saving.  Figures from HMRC show that around 58 per cent of the estimated 900,000 higher rate taxpayers in the UK contribute to defined contribution pension schemes, while another 15 per cent are members of either non-contributory or defined benefit schemes.  But despite earning average salaries of (GBP)58,541, the rest do not save into pension schemes at all. Around 43 per cent of those who don't save into a pension scheme claim to have made alternative retirement arrangements, 4 per cent have existing Self-Invested Personal Pension schemes and another 2 per cent claim they will not retire.  Matthew Stephens, Prudential's tax expert, said: ""Pension saving offers valuable tax reliefs to all workers and particularly to higher rate taxpayers. Basic rate 20 per cent tax relief is available at source plus up to an extra 20 per cent from HMRC for higher rate taxpayers. Turning down what is effectively free money simply does not make sense.  ""It is worrying that so many higher rate taxpayers say they cannot afford to save into a pension despite earning healthy salaries. The good news is that it is never too late to take action on saving for retirement and we urge all workers to seek advice on long-term retirement planning""  The Prudential research shows that recent changes limiting annual tax-free pension contributions to (GBP)50,000 a year have not significantly dented pension saving among higher earners. Just 8 per cent said the change had put them off pension saving while 25 per cent were unaware of the change.

87,Grown-Up Spring Break Spots,"Spending Grown-Up Spring Break Spots Plane tickets might cost more this year, but if you're flexible on days (and not too picky about destinations), there are both spring break hotel bargains to be had - and strategies to avoid partying college students.  Airfare for between Feb. 28 and March 31 is up 9% this spring, to an average of $349, while hotels are down 15%, reports Bing Travel, Microsoft's travel search site. What does that mean for you? Think: travel jujitsu. ""College students tend to go to the same places every year -- Cancun, Palm Springs, South Beach,"" says Erik Torkells, the editor of travel review site TripAdvisor.com. ""They like to stay where all the action is."" For grown-ups, that might mean considering the Big Apple, where vacancies have brought down the prices on three and four star properties. Or a more family-oriented area, like Orlando. If you're really set on the beach, you could have to shell out for a high-end resort students can't afford, or head for hotels and vacation rentals at smaller towns nearby.  Here are three destinations for a bargain Spring Break:  1) Hawaii  Putting aside the recent tsunami scare, Hawaii is still a budget-buster for most college students because of the long-haul flight. But with peak travel season extending through April, there will be bargains - and crowds, says Barbara Messing, the vice president for deal-tracking site Travel-Ticker.com. Outrigger and Ohana resorts, which operate 23 properties on four islands, have dropped rates by up to 65% for travel through April 30. Prices for a standard room at the Ohana Waikiki West start at $79 per night. East Coast residents may be priced out, though: Round-trip flights from Los Angeles start at about $500.  2) Orlando  College students take over many of Florida's beaches, but the theme parks remain the domain of families, says Ian Ford, the founder of travel deal site UndercoverTourist.com. If you can avoid traveling in late March, early April over Easter weekend, there are deals on park properties, too. Disneycut room prices by 25% to 40% through March 27, and then starting up again April 11. You'll pay as little as $79 for a standard room. Round-trip flights from New York start at $175.  3) New York  New York came in third on student travel site StudentUniverse.com's tally of top spring break destinations, based on the number of flights booked. Tourists are unlikely to notice the influx, however, Torkells says. ""If students come to New York, the city absorbs them,"" he says. ""There isn't critical mass."" Expedia.com currently has discounts ranging from 20% to 40% on three- and four-star New York properties. A deluxe king room at The Alex costs as little as $209 per night instead of $349 (a 40% discount), while a superior king room at the Park Central New York Hotel is $179 instead of $239 (25%).",0,0,0
88,Should I use lump sum to pay off mortgage or save for children's studies?,"Should I use lump sum to pay off mortgage or save for children's studies? Ask the experts: Should I use my inheritance to pay off my mortgage or save for my children's university years?  Q I am in my 50s, semi-retired, with £70,000 outstanding on my repayment mortgage which will be paid off by 2017 at the latest (I am currently overpaying). I also have two children of 15 and 13 who will be hoping to go to university.  I am in the fortunate position of being about to inherit £60k later this year and wondered if I should repay my mortgage with the lump sum and use what would have been mortgage repayment money to save for university fees or would it be better to simply invest £30k each for the children now in a trust fund for their education? Or maybe half and half? If I did pay off the mortgage, what kind of product should I invest in? All the ISAs I currently have for them have nearly halved in value and I am reluctant to use them.  My husband and I will be earning (hopefully) for the next four years at least to pay the mortgage off but after that we will go onto pensions which, while relatively generous (half salary), will not allow us to subsidise our children's university education at that time. We need to save now. AT  A Because you are likely to be paying a higher rate of interest on your mortgage than on your savings, I would be tempted to use the £60,000 to help clear the loan and start building up a fund for your children.  Given the time scale involved, it is probably best to stick to low-risk investments where the value of the money you save will not fluctuate. So that means some form of cash savings. If you can commit to regular saving - which you should be able to do - you can earn pretty good rates of interest with the regular savings accounts from Nottingham, Principality, Stroud & Swindon and Buckinghamshire building societies. They pay 5%, 4.5%, 4.5% and 4.12% respectively. Alternatively, you could save in a cash ISA and/or the range of cash savings from National Savings & Investments.  It is also worth bearing in mind that when your children to go to university, paying their fees up front for them may not be the best thing to do. The fact that students can get heavily subsidised loans to pay their fees can mean that it is better to take the cheap loan to pay for fees. In addition, if you and your husband will be living on a much-reduced income by that children, the means test of parental income may mean that they qualify for a non-repayable grant.

Cut Your Tax in 2010 (ISBN 978-1-9355470-5-1) provides the straight talk on how poor tax and retirement planning can cost your family dearly. The book is written by Chicago-area tax and estate planning attorneys Anthony R. Perrelli and Dean R. Hedeker.  ""Cut Your Tax in 2010 isn't about cheating the system,"" explains Perrelli. ""It's about avoiding mistakes on big taxes like estate and capital gains. Legacies are being lost by the second or third generation for no good reason.""  Cut Your Tax in 2010 covers how:  Personal and business assets can be protected in four smart steps. Capital gains taxes can ruin a family's legacy. An estate plan can save your family more than taxes.  ""Those working towards retirement have the most to gain with these insights,"" explains Hedeker. ""The book offers a way to start a dialogue between your own parents, spouse, and children - so that you can begin to work together to secure your family's financial future.""  The book tackles the current estate tax debacle in Congress as a major hot button for 2010. Hedeker and Perrelli point out that those with a decent amount of assets built up need to understand that:  The estate tax is currently scheduled to reappear in 2011, at only a $1 million exemption. Estates that escape a federal estate tax in 2010 may cause inheritors other tax headaches, particularly in capital gains taxes. Most states have their own estate or inheritance taxes. Illinois' estate tax kicks in at $2 million and that won't be changing anytime soon.  ""People thought that no estate tax in 2010 would make this the 'year to die,'"" says Perrelli. ""But it can be a nightmare because estates less than $3.5 million are now subjected to capital gains taxes instead.""  Cut Your Tax in 2010 is available atAmazon.comand other major booksellers.

91,Cloud of debt lifted through financial coaching program,"Cloud of debt lifted through financial coaching program Maggie San Miguel spent years living in fear.  The 47-year-old Austin woman couldn't answer the telephone. She refused to open her mailbox. She couldn't deal with the debt collectors constantly hounding her for the tens of thousands of dollars in debt she had accumulated. So she just ignored them.  She couldn't sleep. She drank to forget everything, she said.  ""Eventually you're just frozen,"" San Miguel said. ""It gets worse and worse and worse. You're just running all the time.""  Then 18 months ago , San Miguel connected with Foundation Communities. She learned how to get her finances under control.  ""It's so freeing,"" she said. ""I've never experience such empowerment. It's amazing.""  Foundation Communities is an Austin-based nonprofit well known for renting affordable apartments and duplexes across the city. Its community tax centers, which provide tax preparation services for low-income people and facilitated $25 million in tax refunds last year, also gets the spotlight. The tax center program is available to individuals making less than $25,000 annually and families earning less than $50,000 per year. Those centers are currently open, and more information is available at www.foundcom.org .  What's less known is the nonprofit's financial coaching programs, which teach people how to set a budget, save money, reduce debt and repair credit. For some people, that coaching is the first time they've ever been taught how to manage their finances, said Katie Hazekamp , a community outreach associate for Foundation Communities.  ""We don't have any financial information incorporated into our education and then we're just supposed to know how to do it,"" she said.  San Miguel did know how to do it. She'd worked in accounting and business for years, she said. But after a five divorces and a bout with breast cancer, San Miguel, who has one son, found herself deeply in debt.  Even though she was working, she couldn't pay off her bills, she said. She didn't know that she could negotiate with creditors or that she should scour her credit report for possible mistakes.  Instead, overwhelmed, she ignored everything. She avoided her mailbox for weeks to avoid the threatening letters.  ""Sometimes, the mailman would leave notes in my mailbox saying, 'You know. . . ,' "" San Miguel said.  In 2008 , while looking for a new place to live, she stumbled across several South Austin duplexes owned by Foundation Communities. She got financial coaching and learned how to attack her debt. And she realized that fear had been her biggest barrier to financial recovery.  Now, San Miguel said, she is paying her bills on time and working with her creditors to pay off her bills. She's learning about financial programs that could allow her to eventually buy her own home.  She answers her phone. She opens her mailbox.  ""It's monumental,"" she said.

92,"Labor helps union, nonunion jobless","Editorial Labor helps union, nonunion jobless By Mark Gaffney  Today's unions are changing to be more relevant to working families. While workers need unions for all of the same reasons they have always needed them - family-supporting jobs, living wages, access to health care and secure retirement plans - they also need help overcoming unemployment.  The economic situation in Michigan and across our nation is crushing some struggling families. When individuals lose their jobs, not only is their usual source of income gone, but also their personal work relationships, daily structures and an important sense of self-purpose.  Unemployment can be, and often is, a shock to the whole system, leading to the same feelings and stresses experienced with other major losses. That's why the Michigan AFL-CIO has created critically needed job clubs across the state, which we call a Labor, Education, Action and Referral Network or LEARN. Labor liaisons from the United Way and representatives of Michigan State AFL-CIO Human Resources Development Inc. meet with unemployed workers, union and nonunion alike, every day somewhere in Michigan to offer support through a difficult transition.  The unemployed are finding information and referrals a necessary way of life. The job clubs provide directions and access to family counseling, credit advice and food banks. In meeting places across the state, including union halls, members are helping each other cope with the economic situation, making suggestions for job searches and sharing valuable information on good job prospects.  LEARN also connects workers, union and nonunion, with services provided by economic development and work force development partners. We link workers to high-quality training and give them the encouragement to start new careers through reschooling and other means.  According to the latest jobs report, the average weeks that individuals are unemployed rose to 29.1 weeks across America - the highest since the government started tracking. That means it takes almost seven months to find a job in America.  In Michigan it is worse. More than 800,000 workers are counted as jobless with over 100,000 unemployed for more than 105 weeks as of December. These 100,000 workers who have been unemployed for more than two years have run out of unemployment benefits.  As Michigan's hard-working people continue to lose their jobs, their benefits and sometimes use up their pensions, they are turning to unions for assistance. And we are not letting them down.

93,8. Pay down debt,"Guardian Money Pages 8. Pay down debt This, claims Jill Insley, is going to be the year when I practise what I invariably preach and actually do something about paying off all my unsecured debt.  I was good at keeping my bank account in the black until I had a baby - then it all went pear-shaped. Even before she was born, my daughter was good at getting me to spend money on her . . . and it's never really stopped.  Two years on, I became a single parent, and like many people who split up with their partners, I didn't cut back enough on our lifestyle-spending to fit my new budget. I gradually built up debt on a credit card, then on a second one, and my bank account has been constantly overdrawn.  Last year I paid off one credit card. But I have another to go, plus the overdraft. By the start of 2011 I want to have just one credit card that I can pay off in full every month (if I have used it), and no overdraft.  * Action plan  Switch cards to make sure you pay little or no interest on credit balances. According to the credit card tables on www.guardian.co.uk/money, the best balance transfer deal is now offered by Virgin: it charges 2.98% for transferring your balance, then 0% for 16 months. Just be aware that the card is run by MBNA and your application will be rejected if you already have a card with that company - as well as leaving a footprint on your credit record.  With interest rates so low on mortgage debt, now is a good time to use any surplus to pay down more costly unsecured debt. Overdrafts are obviously more expensive than 0% credit cards, so it makes more sense paying the minimum on the credit card until the overdraft has gone.  Close down any dormant savings accounts with odd bits of money in and pay the cash into the overdrawn current account.  Likewise, liquidate any non-performing investments. Better that they save you the interest you would otherwise be paying than sit in the hands of a hapless investment manager doing nothing.  Sell unwanted toys/books/bikes/coffee makers on eBay or at your local car boot sale.  Look for other savings by: switching broadband and landline suppliers (www.guardiandigitalcomparison.co.uk suggests a bundle provided by Orange for pounds 10 a month, with 20Mb broadband, unlimited download and free evening and weekend calls); switch gas and electricity deals (www.energyhelpline.com says Npower's Sign On-Line could take pounds 172 a year off my British Gas tariff, while Ovo New Energy, a newish utility provider, will only save pounds 144 but may be a better bet service-wise).  Leave the plastic perisher at home, ask for your credit limit to be reduced each time you pay back pounds 1,000 to eliminate the temptation of spending - and cut it up once it's paid off.",1,1,0

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 3 points at 10549. The S&P 500 climbed fractionally to finish the day at 1126, and the Nasdaq edged up 3 to 2291.The stagnation occurred despite a pop in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which rose to 60 this month, up from 56.1 in November. Expectations were for a nudge down to 55.1. A reading over 50 indicates growth.  In Washington, the government appears close to giving GMAC Financial Services another $3.5 billion in aid, in addition to the $12.5 its already put in since December 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing an anonymous source.  Meanwhile, airlines and stocks overseas were hit hard early on concerns that Japanese Airlines' restructuring will involve bankruptcy.  The airline sector also faced more security worries, as President Obama said Wednesday that a ""systemic failure"" had occurred in the handling of information that could have prevented a Christmas Day terrorism attempt on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. OSI Systems, which makes security equipment for airlines, jumped more than 9%.  Most of the airlines rallied in afternoon trading and finished in the black.  Stocks overseas were higher.

95,Don't be too late,"Don't be too late FINANCIAL security is the most common factor when it comes to deciding about when to retire, according to research released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the current financial year.  ``But the problem is, without professional retirement planning advice, it's near impossible for most people to know if they're financially secure enough to provide for the retirement they  want,'' says John Newcomb, from RetireInvest Robina.  While their retirement lump sum is likely to be the biggest sum of money they've ever had, and may seem like a fortune, when the impact of tax and inflation is considered - and the fact the money might have to last for a retirement of up to 20 years plus - the amount might not end up stretching far at all.  ``It's important to think in advance about what sort of lifestyle you're expecting in retirement and consider the costs.''  While the government age pension may offer some support, and should be maximised through every reasonable way, it's not something to aspire to of itself.  In the quarter to September, 2007, the cost of living increased to $48,000 a year for retired couples with a lifestyle that included a broad range of leisure activities, private health insurance, a reasonable car, good clothes, and occasional international travel, according to Westpac/Association of Superannuation Funds research.  For those leading a more modest retirement lifestyle, better than the age pension but still fairly basic, the yearly cost was $26,300.  ``With life expectance increasing, it's even more important to ensure your retirement finances are well-planned so you don't outlive your money,'' says John.  When it comes to retiring, there are complex rules around tax, social security, investments and superannuation and  so many ways to structure finances.  ``If Australians only seek financial advice once in their life, planning for retirement is the time to do it and the earlier they seek advice, the more options they'll have,'' says John.  Professional financial advisers can help people identify what sort of retirement lifestyle they want and how to structure their resources to make the most of tax and social security rules and ensure they have a reliable income.  They can provide advice about how and where retirement savings should be put, how to get the most from superannuation and when to retire, as well as how to plan your estate so it's distributed to who you want in the most effective manner.  ``You only have one life so make the most of your retirement with help from a financial adviser,'' says John.  To find out more about how to retire successfully, or to attend one of this month's seminars, phone RetireInvest Robina on 5593 0000.  l John Newcomb is an authorised representative of RetireInvest Pty Limited (ABN 23 001 774 125), Australian Financial Services Licence 238429.

96,Consolidation loans - not the easy way out,"Consolidation loans - not the easy way out Debt consolidation can seem like an easy way out when the bills get too much. What could be simpler, after all, than rolling all those fiddly direct debits and standing orders into one handy payment each month, so you know exactly how much is going out and on what date?  Debt consolidation can help people to cope with their bills and even avoid going bankrupt. And if repayments on the loan are made promptly each month, a consolidation loan can be used to re-establish a good credit record.  However, debt consolidation loans can be a dangerous. Before you take out a consolidation loan you should understand the difference between secured and unsecured lending and the effect of compound interest  A secured loan, the type usually used for debt consolidation, is one that is linked to your house. The house is the security for the loan so, if you don't make all the repayments, the lender might be able to make you sell your home to pay them back.  This means that a secured loan is riskier for the borrower than an unsecured loan, which is not linked to anything. The worst penalty you face for defaulting on an unsecured loan is to be taken to court. But you should be aware that this might mean in the future you could have trouble getting such things as a credit card, a mortgage or other loan.  Compound interest is interest which is charged on interest that has already been added to a loan. If you do not make your monthly payments in full, you end up paying interest on interest.  How much you pay for a loan in total will be governed by the interest rate and the length of the loan. If you extend the length of your loan, even if the interest rate remains the same as on your previous loans, you will end up paying more back to your lender in the long run.  Debt consolidation loans usually work by bringing your monthly payments down to a level that you feel you can more comfortably afford. But they do this by extending the period of the loan, and making you pay more over the period.  Secured loans are usually offered on a variable rate basis so you could find your repayments soaring if interest rates rise.  So, before you take out a secured loan you should look at other options, including selling valuable items you no longer require, or moving your credit card and store card debt to a card with a lower interest rate.  If you have equity in your home, you could consider remortgaging to release capital as the interest rate on a mortgage tends to be lower than on secured loans.  Remortgaging your house in order to pay off debts does mean that you are securing those debts against your home and as such carries the same risk if you do not keep up the repayments as with a secured loan.",1,1,0
97,Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals,"Guardian Financial Pages Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals Abbey today become the first major high street lender to clamp down on low-cost ""interest-only"" mortgages by reducing the maximum loan for such deals to as little as 50% of the property's value.  Growing numbers of borrowers have turned to interest-only loans as a way of affording high property prices. Customers pay interest but none of the capital debt.  In late 2006 the Financial Services Authority warned that thousands of homebuyers taking out these mortgages could be putting themselves at risk of repossession because they have little or no idea how they will pay back the loan.  Abbey said interest-only borrowers with ""a proven repayment vehicle in place"" would be able to borrow up to 75% of a property's value, down from 85%. Those who cannot produce evidence of a repayment vehicle will be limited to 50%. ""This reduces the risk to both the customer and to Abbey, and is prudent given ongoing market conditions,"" a bank spokesman said.  Nationwide yesterday increased the minimum deposit it demands from new borrowers to 10% on all but two of its mortgage products. Britain's biggest building society also halved its maximum loan to pounds 500,000, little more than two weeks after reducing it to pounds 1m.  Nationwide is the latest in a line of banks and building societies to rein in lending in response to the credit crunch. On Saturday Halifax increased some of its fixed and tracker mortgage rates by up to 0.6 of a percentage point.  Nationwide is reducing its maximum loan-to-value ratio from 95% to 90% on all products for new borrowers except its three-year fixed-rate mortgage and three- year tracker, both available to people looking to borrow 95% of a property's value.  Its move will fuel concern that 95% mortgages are under threat; Cheltenham & Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester and Britannia are among other lenders to have capped their maximum loans at 90%.  Halifax is one of the few lenders that still offers mortgages up to 95%, though it charges a higher rate for such loans.  Nationwide also said new customers wanting to take out its standard variable-rate deal, which it calls its ""base mortgage rate"", will need a deposit of at least 25%, and that this deal will be available only to customers dealing directly with it. It described the moves, which take effect from May 1, as ""part of its ongoing approach of managing business in a prudent and sustainable way"".  Sean Gardner, at personal finance website MoneyExpert.com, said the biggest struggle for buyers now was not being able to afford a mortgage but getting one. ""If you've not got a substantial deposit or equity in your house, then your choices are now severely limited. On average, if you are remortgaging you now need a deposit of 15.5% if you take out a fixed or variable mortgage.""",0,1,1

G. writes: My wife and I had to cancel our holiday as I fell ill just before we were due to go. Our travel insurer refuses to pay compensation as I cannot provide a doctor's note. Is there anything we can do?  P. D. replies: All travel insurance policies require you to provide satisfactory evidence in support of a claim. In cases such as yours, a doctor's note confirming you are too ill to travel is usually needed.  But it is not strictly necessary for this letter to be issued at the time you were ill. If your doctor was aware of the illness - perhaps you visited for medication or advice - you could ask the surgery to write a note today. This should refer to the original illness and state that you were unfit to travel.  Most insurers will consider your claim, even if the letter is written after the event.  But in the absence of a doctor's note, I am afraid you will not be able to claim.  T. K. writes: My mortgage deal ends next month and I will still owe £18,000, which I want to pay off as soon as possible.  The new mortgage deals from my existing provider look uncompetitive. Should I look elsewhere?  R. C. replies: Yes. Even though you want only an £18,000 mortgage, most lenders will consider this.  But if you do switch to a new lender, watch out for stinging legal fees and valuation costs and make sure to avoid deals with early repayment penalties.  As the loan amount is small and you plan to repay the debt as fast as you can, you might find your existing lender's standard variable rate - usually fee-free and penalty-free - works out cheapest, but there is no harm in shopping around.  When comparing deals, think about how quickly you intend to reduce your mortgage. Some lenders offer more flexible provisions for monthly overpayments or lump sum repayments.",0,1,1
99,No margin for error...,"No margin for error... OPES Prime investors appear to have a we problem.  Thats the stockbroking firm that went bust recently, owing more than $1 billion.  According to Sunday Times financial columnist Noel Whittaker, Opes clients took out an Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement (AMSLA).  It appears most thought they had regular margin loans, whereby the money borrowed to invest in assets was secured by the underlying investments. If their investments fell below a certain level in value, they would expect a margin call. This would signal they needed to top up their investment, which would remain their property.  But in the case of Opes, ultimately the lender actually owned the shares in this transaction. The purchase confirmation letters to clients, according to Whittaker, read We have bought for you...  In other words, we bought, we own. Or at least the ANZ bank did.  AMSLAs aside, Whittaker still has faith in margin lending, which he calls one of the best wealth-building strategies available.  But the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Australias corporate, markets and financial services regulator, does not share his enthusiasm, noting:  Borrowing money to invest in shares and managed funds using a margin loan is one of the riskiest ways of financing your investments. It can succeed, but understand the risks.  The far shakier Opes with the de rigueur financier running funds in the Caymans and British Virgin Islands still had its champions, including WAs Olympic legend Herb Elliott, who appears to have lost more than $20 million.  The Fortescue Metals Group director was never beaten over a mile, and would probably like to have run a mile from Opes before the wee hit the fan.  We can sympathise to some extent, as human nature dictates that many of us will chase bigger than usual returns, even if they appear unrealistic.  But as Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens has noted of mortgage stress the logic can also be applied to other forms of investing particularly among the wealthier.  As you get more affluent, some of the necessities take up a smaller share of income and some of the things you really want take up a larger share, he said.  For those opting for a more expensive home: That is not stress, per se; that is a choice.  For the western suburbs, the messages are mixed. According to ABN Amro economist Kieran Davies, the prestige end of the property market the $5 million to $20 million bracket is thriving.  But property research group RP Data notes that the top end is likely to come under greater pressure if luxury homes cant be sold, particularly when the owner has a hefty share portfolio coupled with a frightening margin call or two.  It comes back to fundamentals, doesnt it? Allow a margin for error. Perhaps have another look at the fine print in your investment contracts. And if you are going to cut investment corners, look out for increasingly big financial vehicles coming rather rapidly in the opposite direction. Oui?  CWS-20080415-002-102065",0,0,0
100,Women still lack financial self esteem,"BUSINESS Women still lack financial self esteem       A NEW report about what Australian women think about money shows a reluctance and low confidence to make investments.        The report, launched by the Financial Literacy Foundation, includes a comprehensive survey of how women describe their abilities, attitudes and behaviour on money issues, such as budgeting, saving, investing and protecting their money.        ``Women are more likely to have time outside the paid workforce and lower incomes, which in the end means less superannuation,'' foundation chairman Paul Clitheroe said.        ``Not only that, women's savings need to go further because they tend to live longer,'' Mr Clitheroe said.        Generally, many women already have good budgeting and saving habits. However, when it comes to investing, planning for the future and retirement -- all things that allow people to take long-term control of their money -- women say they're not confident.        Overall, the survey found:        * More than 70 per cent of women say they're confident with managing money, except for investing (63 per cent), understanding financial language (60 per cent) and ensuring enough money for retirement (60 per cent).        * Women and men have similar day-to-day money habits but women are more likely to regularly budget for day-to-day finances (women 53 per cent, men 44 per cent).        * Women are also more likely to invest in their own home (women 64 per cent, men 60 per cent) but less likely to have other investments.        * More men then women say they understand financial language (women 60 per cent, men 68 per cent) and more men say they can plan for their long-term future than women (women 77 per cent, men 84 per cent).        Importantly, the report found that women want to learn more about managing their money better.        ``I'm pleased to see that investing, planning for the future and retirement are all areas where women are interested in learning more,'' said Mr Clitheroe.        ``And it's not just important for women, I'd encourage everyone to take control of their long-term financial plans, as well as putting themselves in charge of their money day to day,'' he said.

101,BORROWERS TOLD TO ACT FAST OVER MORTGAGES,"City BORROWERS TOLD TO ACT FAST OVER MORTGAGES       Mortgage brokers were today urging homeowners to grab new loan deals now before they are scrapped.        As the flood of mortgages being pulled extended today to competitively priced products from a range of building societies, advisers said customers were having to move quickly before the most attractive deals disappear.        Brokers said they were encouraging customers to buy their products sometimes several months in advance.        Richard Morea of London & Country mortgages said: 'Until recently, the companies would tell us with plenty of notice if they were planning to withdraw a product so we could ring up the client and warn them. Now we don't even get told in advance. It's just gone.'        As many mortgages are guaranteed for up to six months, customers who think rates are going up can reserve a deal now even if their current mortgage deal does not expire until late summer.        Morea said: 'What we're saying is, if you like this offer, grab it now even if you don't need it for a few months.'        In the past two days, more than 570 mortgages have been withdrawn.        Last night saw Nottingham Building Society pull its buy-to-let two and three-year tracker, while the West Bromwich withdrew all its mainstream and buy-to-let mortgages, replacing them with more expensive options.        Darlington Building Society also withdrew its fixed products while Skipton announced plans for a £799 fee to its standard variable rate.        First Direct, the internet and telephone bank owned by    HSBC, this week closed its doors on new mortgages, while Nationwide has jacked up rates for many borrowers, particularly first-time buyers.        Rob Clifford, of broker Mortgage-force, cautioned: 'Can you rely upon a quote from a lender? The answer is no.        'Lenders are not obliged to honour quotes and could elect to reject all applications or offer less attractive deals.        'Consumers haven't got a cast-iron deal unless they have received a formal mortgage offer from the lender.'        The Bank of England yesterday warned that almost half of all lenders will ration mortgages over the next three months.        It recently conceded that two interest rate cuts since December, from 5.75% 5.25%, had done nothing to reduce mortgage costs as banks and building societies put up their own rates. The Bank is under growing pressure to cut rates to 5% next week.        The squeeze on credit by mortgage suppliers - and the prospect of job cuts in the City - is already hitting the housing market. The International Monetary Fund warned British house prices are overvalued by almost 30%.        Default rates on mortgages are expected to rise sharply this year.        Philip Shaw of Investec said: 'The situation has deteriorated further and that's consistent with the news over the past few days that mortgage lenders have been raising their rates and withdrawing products.        'Overall we feel there is a very strong case for rates coming down next week.'",1,1,0
102,Dividing the spoils,"BUSINESS Dividing the spoils       Q&A with accountant Phil Gostin        Q. How do you give your kids money without having to die first?        A. Assuming the parents have assets, and do not have any pension or concessions that could be affected in any way, it is as simple as realising the asset, paying the tax, (if applicable), and straight through to the keeper. But each situation is different.        Q. What are the consequences of giving your kids a deposit for their home or pay their kids school fees?        A. It depends. Firstly, do the parents have the ability to give? Will it impinge on their lifestyle? Will they cope in the event of failing health? The main consequences are effect on pension and tax. But if the parents have a super fund, no Centrelink issues, are retired and aged over 60 their ``drawings'' from funds are tax-free from July 1, 2007. However, if there is a Centrelink consequence, it needs to be looked at to ensure the best outcome.        Q. Is it better to withdraw lump sums from your super?        A. Because the goal posts have shifted, once you are retired and over 60 it's tax free -- whether it's taken as a lump or on the drip, is not the issue. The issue is to make it last, be able to give something to the kids if you can, or leave what remains to them.        Q. What about transferring assets into children's names?        A. The problem is the potential tax implications. Assuming assets were in the parents' name and post 1985, subject to capital gains tax, and if the parents still have significant income in their names, it might not be a good idea. But if the income is a pension from a super fund (self-managed or otherwise), then the tax may not be as significant.        Q. What are tax implications?        A. Tax is tax. Really the cashflow situation is the relevant one. For example, if we do this how much are we going to get? Again, it depends on what assessable income the parents are earning and from where -- ie. Centrelink.        Q. What are the limits or implications of gifting?        A. Gifting is only an issue if you have some aged pension benefit. You can only give $10,000 a year. It is important to note that you can give as much as you want but Centrelink will deem your asset base as dropping only by $10,000 a year. So you can give $100,000 but $90,000 is still included in the asset test when calculating the pension.        Q. Is it wiser to set up a family trust and make distributions that way?        A. The trust arrangement, first and foremost is about asset protection. It can be used for estate planning, but this ought to be done at set-up. What parents sometimes want to do is give the benefit of the investment without losing control of it.        DHS-20080331-1-030-597646",1,1,0
103,SECOND-CHANCE INVESTING,"Smart Money SECOND-CHANCE INVESTING For the $3.4 billion Argo Investments fund, the latest stockmarket pullback is something to be taken in its stride.  The fund is the epitome of the long-term investor: it has been around for 60 years and makes many of its more recent competitors look like traders.  What is interesting about the market reaction to the reversal, says managing director Rob Patterson, who has been with the listed fund for more than 30 years, is the gloom and doom and confusion it appears to have created.  For Argo, the reversal, which has stripped three months of out-performance from the market, has presented the fund with an opportunity to top up its holdings of resources shares.  Patterson says investors need to remember that the correction has only taken the market back to the levels of March this year.  The rally and retreat since then, which has attracted a lot of noise, is something that could be history when company reporting begins in August.  Argo is a value investor, says Patterson, choosing shares on the basis of their scope to deliver higher profits and dividends.  It also emphasises diversification with a 180-stock portfolio, although Patterson says he'd like to reduce it to 150 holdings.  ""But it is not easy with the many new floats we've seen in recent times,"" he says.  Argo is a very long-term holder and rarely sells. Its biggest holding is an investment in Macquarie Bank that evolved from an interest in the unlisted Hill Samuel merchant bank that evolved into Macquarie. The holding represents about 7 per cent of the fund and is a legacy of not selling any investments just because they have made a profit.  Its other long-term investments are in BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, along with the major banks and industrials such as Wesfarmers, Orica, AMP, Foster's and Westfield.  From an investor perspective, an attraction of Argo is its tiny annual fee of 0.25 per cent.  Patterson says Argo's value- focused approach made it a challenge to find new investments in the surging market.  Other commentators offered the following ideas to explore.  Stock Doctor's Elio D'Amato considers health-care company Ansell a good proposition based on its discounted price to earnings ratio, compared with its peers.  Services provider Count Financial gets a mention because it should benefit from the recent budget superannuation changes, plus the baby-boomer generation hitting 60 and needing more tax and investment advice.  Fat Prophets' Jason McIntosh says Lihir Gold is worth considering for those who missed the first gold-price surge.  The correction, he says, has given investors a second chance to get involved in an exciting gold play.  He also considers the correction to have provided a second chance to invest in top-tier miners and energy companies such as BHP Billiton and Woodside.  Commonwealth Securities strategist Charles Hyde says there is also value in BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto in the pullback.",0,0,0
104,COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes,"COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes     Until lenders offer get out clauses so clients can switch out of 10- year fixed mortgages, longer term deals will remain a tough sell in terms of best advice, says Sally Laker      A couple of decades ago I would have given my right arm to have been able to fix my mortgage at 8%, let alone 5%. If it had been a 10-year deal even better. Why? Because interest rates were at 14%.      Luckily Bank of Scotland came to the rescue with what was called a stabiliser mortgage and this helped many a borrower survive. With this deal, the client agreed with the lender what rate they would pay. If interest rates went down they owed less and if they went up they owed more. An adjustment was then made to the loan after three years.      So what has all this got to do with fixed rates in today's marketplace? Well, it's a sign of the times. As I have mentioned, back in the late 1980s we would have done anything for a fixed rate and 8% would have been a steal but now things have changed so much that even a 10-year fixed rate at 4.99% will not necessarily fly out the door.      It seems crazy but we have become a nation of short-term fixers. We want two or three-year deals because we are ever optimistic that after two or three years the rates will be even lower. In reality this is unlikely to happen nowadays, but there will be a rate there or thereabouts.      So why not fix for longer and save switching every two years in hope of a better deal? In the case of best advice, it is a tough call to recommend a 10-year deal and effectively be sure that fix will be good for 10 years as well as proving that the client wouldn't be better off checking and switching every two years. Who can predict for certain that interest rates won't change much in 10 years, up or down?      Unless lenders can offer the equivalent of break clauses or get out clauses that allow borrowers to switch out of their fixes to other products during that 10-year period, longer term deals will be difficult to sell.      Nobody will want to pay hefty redemption penalties to switch even if it is to a more attractive product. Again, it is possible that many won't switch, but not having the option is a deterrent to even considering it.      We have become a nation of switchers. We switch credit cards, car insurance, house insurance - and now mortgages are seen as an extension of that.      This is all great news for brokers as it is their business to look after their clients and check their mortgages fit their requirements. And we know that those requirements can change in a two-year period - you only have to ask Tony Blair about that.",0,1,1
105,Offshore bonds better onshore counterparts bob goulding | Clerical Medical,"Supplement Offshore bonds better onshore counterparts bob goulding | Clerical Medical     Offshore bonds are beneficial for investors who have more than £250,000 to invest or are considered a non-domicile or non-resident for UK tax purposes.      According to Bob Golding, international planning manager at Clerical Medical, offshore bonds can outperform onshore on long-term investments of £250,000 or more, due to the compounding effect of gross roll up. However, he said it was necessary for clients to have a bond for at least 20 years to benefit from this.      For example, if a client invested £250,000 in an offshore bond and the same amount was put into an onshore bond, the offshore product would outperform the UK-domiciled bond after 20 years, if an 8% growth rate was assumed. After 30 years the offshore product would have grown to £1,100,000 compared to the onshore product with £1,000,000.      This takes into account both taxes and charges for the bonds. The onshore bond has been taxed 20% within the fund, while the offshore bond has had a 40% charge applied to the gains. However, Golding stressed that high-income earners could be taxed a further 20% on gains in an onshore bond.      As charges are also generally higher on offshore bonds, the final net return on smaller investments for shorter time scales does not make it worthwhile as the compounding effect of gross roll up does not have time to take effect, Golding explained.      However, he argued offshore bonds were beneficial for non-domiciles, non-UK residents and those absent for more than 182 days in one tax year.      He said gains on an offshore life policy could be reduced directly in proportion to the time the policyholder spent as a non-UK resident. For a non-domicile or a person not born in the UK, an offshore bond would be considered outside the scope of UK inheritance tax. According to Golding, there are around 60,000 non-domiciles in the UK, with this number steadily rising.      Offshore bonds also provide investors with a greater fund choice compared to onshore bonds, Golding pointed out. He explained: ""Permissible funds can include hedge funds as well as offshore deposit accounts. Also, if a client wanted to use discretionary management services this would also be allowed.""      The advantages of an onshore bond, Golding explained, included capital gains tax indexation and lower management charges which can be deducted from a fund's income for tax purposes.      Taxpayers who are on a low income when encashing the bond pay no further tax liability, while higher rate tax payers pay 36% once the initial 20% tax has been taken from within the fund. This compares to 40% tax on an offshore bond (see diagram above).      key points      Offshore bonds outperform onshore for investments other than £250,000 held for more than 20 years      Onshore bonds outperform offshore for smaller sums and shorter time scales      Offshore bonds beneficial for a non-resident and a non-domicile",0,1,1
106,Money Management: Keeping it in the family.,"Money Management: Keeping it in the family.     It was uncertain how many providers would launch family pension products after Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in the Budget that these plans would still attract a tax charge when passing pension assets from generation to generation.      But Origen, the IFA business owned by Aegon, has clearly decided that the product still has its attractions with the launch of its first family self-invested personal pension.      The pension is established under a separate sub-trust within a SIPP and brings spouses, children, family members or friends into the SIPP prior to death as additional members.      Up to age 75, pension members use drawdown to provide an income; if they die during this time, a dependant's pension may be paid or money may be taken out of the pension to be paid to a beneficiary, less a 35% tax charge.      From age 75, an alternatively secured pension (ASP) is used to provide income; if a member dies during this time any dependant's pension would be paid with the balance of the fund going to the recipients' pension schemes, minus any IHT liabilities.      Charges vary by type of member: founder members and additional members who contribute more than AGBP3,600 pa pay an establishment fee of AGBP300, an annual fee of AGBP500 and AGBP150 pa for drawing an income.      Additional members who contribute AGBP3,600 pa or less pay a set-up charge of AGBP250 and AGBP200 pa. Non-contributing members pay a set-up fee of AGBP250 then AGBP100 pa. IFA commission is available, but must be paid out of the client's funds.      www.origenfs.co.uk   MM view - In abolishing the requirement that everyone must buy an annuity by age 75, the Chancellor opened up the possibility of passing on pension assets after death. Until he clarified their tax position in the Budget, it had been hoped that they could be passed to the next generation intact, with no IHT liability.      However, Brown stated in the Budget that assets held in an ASP would be considered part of a pensioner's estate and therefore could be subject to IHT before being passed to heirs' pension funds.      Many people prefer passing on 60% of leftover pension assets to their heirs rather than nothing. But news has emerged that a loophole in the Finance Act 2005 makes it possible for pension assets to be passed to other scheme members without paying any IHT through a small self-administered scheme (SSAS).      SSASs are no longer required to purchase a pension from an insurance company and can instead pay out directly from the scheme itself, reallocating money to other scheme members when one member dies.      This type of pension is not an option for all, but for those that can set up SSASs, (eg, small family businesses), this loophole makes it a more attractive alternative than the family SIPP proposition. Any IFAs also wishing to market this SIPP should contact Origen direct.      monica.woodley@ft.com      49045288",1,1,0
107,Some banks offer reward points for debit card use,"MONEY Some banks offer reward points for debit card use     Credit card users have long enjoyed rewards for charging purchases, staying at certain hotels or flying on designated airlines. Now, as debit cards claim a rising share of electronic sales, more banks are offering points for debit card use, too.      Increasingly, debit card users are gaining points redeemable for plane tickets, merchandise or cash.      Last week, MasterCard joined with Upromise, an educational services company, to let banks deposit money into customers' college savings plans when they pay grocery, gas or restaurant bills with a debit card. This year, Washington Mutual introduced a debit card that gives customers 3 cents back for each purchase, up to $250 a year in rebates.      Citibank now awards customers points for using its bank products and services, including debit cards.      Bank of America offers to round up debit card users' purchases to the nearest dollar, then transfer that amount to a savings account.      Be aware, though: Debit card rewards tend to be leaner than credit card rewards. For example, banks generally offer one point for every $2 spent with a debit card, compared with one point for every $1 spent with a credit card, says Chris Allen of Dove Consulting.      If you're trying to earn a plasma TV or a vacation trip through debit card use, it'll generally take twice as long with a debit card as with a credit card. ""Banks are not going to be able to offer the same wham-bam experiential type of thing"" because they're not getting the finance or penalty charges they do from credit cards, says David Robertson of Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter.      Still, more banks are rolling out debit card rewards. In 2005, more than one-third of financial institutions gave rewards for debit card use, up from a fourth in 2003, Dove says. About a third of banks that don't offer such a program are considering it, the firm says.      The rewards are being offered as debit card use is rising. One third of retail purchases were made by debit cards in 2005, up from 26% in 2001, according to the American Bankers Association and Dove Consulting. During the same period, the percentage of retail purchases charged to credit cards fell slightly.      ""It's an evolution in the marketplace,"" says Stacey Pinkerd of Visa USA. ""Consumers are using (debit) cards like mad.""      Banks encourage customers to sign rather than enter personal identification numbers on debit card purchases because banks get higher fees for signature sales. If you sign for a $100 debit card purchase, the store will have to pay banks an average fee of $1.39, compared with 61 cents if you enter a PIN, the Nilson Report says.      These costs, though, are typically being passed on to people in the form of higher prices for products, notes J. Craig Shearman of the National Retail Federation.

108,"Personal Business: OK, if I Just Pay the Card Minimum. . .Ouch","Personal Business: OK, if I Just Pay the Card Minimum. . .Ouch     You know that making only the minimum required payments on a credit card can be extremely costly over time. Several lawmakers want to make sure you see exactly how steep the tab can be -- by requiring personalized disclosures of the time and total interest payments it could take to retire your debt.      In the meantime, you can also find those scary numbers yourself, using online tools such as one at Bankrate.com.      Consider a consumer with a $7,000 balance on a card with a 12% interest rate. If the person paid the minimum due, typically 1% of the balance plus interest each month, it would take nearly 28 years -- yes, you read that correctly, 28 years -- to pay the balance down. The payment would start at $139.30 a month and get smaller as the balance fell. The total interest, $6,762.18, would nearly equal the original debt, according to Bankrate.com.      But if the consumer continued to pay a steady $139.30 every month, the debt would be paid off in less than six years and interest would amount to about $2,775, the online calculator shows. Pay $200 a month, and you'd be done in less than four years. At Bankrate.com, click on the ""Credit Cards"" tab and then, under ""Calculators,"" go to ""Paying the minimum.""      Five bills that would mandate customized disclosures are pending in Congress. Supporters hope to get some momentum from a recent study by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, on whether such disclosures might lead cardholders to make more-informed financial decisions. In a survey of cardholders, GAO found that people with credit-card debt wanted customized disclosures and found them very useful.      In the future, under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, card issuers will be required to include on statements a general disclosure about the consequences of making only minimum payments, as well as a toll-free phone number for obtaining individualized information. The Federal Reserve is working on regulations to implement that law, which it expects to finish by the end of next year.      The GAO found that some lawmakers, consumer groups and educators believe that customized disclosures would be more noticeable and cause consumers to make larger payments or change how they use their cards. But card issuers told the GAO the proposed change wouldn't have much impact. They said the number of cardholders who routinely make only minimum payments is small, and that those who do pay the minimum probably can't afford to do otherwise.      The GAO study, released last month, was requested by Sens. Paul Sarbanes, (D., Md.) and Daniel K. Akaka, (D., Hawaii). Sen. Akaka introduced one of the credit-card disclosure bills and he ""hopes that the GAO report will boost support for his efforts in passing his legislation,"" says his press secretary.

109,Wealth: What you can learn from the big-money investors,"Wealth: What you can learn from the big-money investors     Big institutional investors are different from you and me. But that doesn't mean we can't learn from the way they handle money.      True, pension funds and other large players have more investment expertise and more access to investment talent. But here's a secret: In hiring independent investment firms to manage U.S.- and foreign-stock holdings, institutions stick to a methodical approach that anyone can follow.      How? When choosing a mutual fund or hiring any investment professional, pay attention to these criteria that institutions use in manager searches.      -- Process: Look for a Strategy      ""The first thing we look for is the business strategy: What is the firm as an organization trying to do?"" says Mary Cottrill, a senior portfolio manager for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, who oversees the pension fund's U.S. and international stock managers.      Every money manager Calpers hires must face a rigorous grilling, starting with a long questionnaire probing the firm's investment philosophy and how it aims to deliver solid long-term results. ""There's got to be some edge,"" Ms. Cottrill says. ""We always ask `What's the unique characteristic that your firm brings? What differentiates you from your competitors?'""      -- People: Incentives and Pay      A money manager's most valuable assets go home each night. So it's crucial that a firm has proper incentives to retain personnel, says Roger Fenningdorf, head of global manager research at Rocaton Investment Advisors LLC, a pension-plan consultant in Norwalk, Connecticut.      It's also important that the people overseeing the business be separate from those who oversee clients' money, and that succession plans exist so departures don't disrupt the investment process. ""We focus on firms that have a stable investment team and business team, and have a strong philosophy on [regulatory] compliance,"" Mr. Fenningdorf says.      -- Focus: Straight and Narrow      Discipline and consistency are among the qualities institutions value most. They are specific about dividing holdings across asset classes. Managers generally are hired for a certain expertise -- small stocks, foreign stocks, growth or value -- and are expected to stick to their knitting. ""We want to make sure they do what they say,"" Mr. Fenningdorf notes. Otherwise, there's a risk a slumping manager could switch to a hot sector, upsetting a carefully built portfolio. Discipline keeps managers on track until the tide turns in favor of their style.      -- Passion: What It Means      ""We're looking for talented, tenured, experienced teams that are passionate about investing,"" said Joe Brennan, head of portfolio review at Vanguard Group, the mutual-fund giant.      ""We see hundreds of potential managers a year,"" he says. Some managers gush about the number of new accounts or revenue their firms reeled in lately. Those aren't the priorities that Vanguard supports, Mr. Brennan says. ""Most great managers, you can't shut them up about stocks -- that's all they want to talk about,"" he says.",1,1,0
110,"Planner: Turn portfolio to more conservative path ; Without a secure job, it's important to tone down risk","MONEY Planner: Turn portfolio to more conservative path ; Without a secure job, it's important to tone down risk  Stacy Kopper has done two things very well, says Janet Briaud, a financial planner in Bryan, Texas.   ""She has developed a really nice portfolio for her age and kept her spending way down in this uncertain time,"" Briaud says.   The main thing Kopper needs to do, she says, is tone down the risk in her portfolio. ""If you don't have a secure job, then you want your portfolio to be more secure and safe.""   Given that Kopper plans to continue working into retirement age, as long as her investment assets grow a little bit, she doesn't need to take a lot of risk. Another reason to err on the side of caution is that stock valuations are high now.   ""It's just a time for Stacy especially to be pretty conservative,"" Briaud says.   To accomplish that, Briaud suggests that Kopper:   * Invest the IRA accounts in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). ""They are very safe and secure investments that I think are underutilized,"" Briaud says. ""They are tax inefficient, so you want them in a retirement account.""   * Divide the roughly 30% of her assets now in the non-retirement portfolio among three mutual funds. Because the market is overvalued, Briaud recommends a mix of value-oriented funds and funds with a hedging strategy to help protect against volatility.   Specifically, she recommends a small-cap value fund, such as Oakmark Small Cap, and an international value fund, such as Tweedy Browne Global Value or Longleaf Partners International.   Briaud's third stock fund recommendation is Hussman Strategic Growth, which invests in U.S. stocks with the goal of preserving capital during unfavorable market conditions.   * Maintain her current cash position. ""She's got about 20% in cash, and I think that's appropriate,"" Briaud says.   * Put about 20% of her portfolio in a laddered portfolio of short- term Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from one to three years.

""I think eventually the dollar will come down, and another 10% in an international bond fund would help in that environment,"" she says.   Kopper should focus on getting the job she wants and making her portfolio more conservative. Once she's done those two things, she can begin to think about buying a home.   For the moment, she is lucky not to own a home, Briaud says. Home prices are high, and not owning a home gives her more flexibility in her job hunt.   The fact that Kopper's expenses are low and she has accumulated sizable savings gives her unusual freedom to make major changes. ""Her biggest asset is ability to earn,"" Briaud says.

111,Portman: Hasn't Received Any Takeover Approaches,"Portman: Hasn't Received Any Takeover Approaches     PERTH (Dow Jones)--Portman Ltd. (PMM.AU) said Monday that it hasn't had any approaches from Hong Kong's Mega Harvest Resources, despite media speculation that the iron ore miner is in the sights of Hong Kong businessman Lee Ming Tee.      ""There have been no discussions and no approaches at this point,"" Portman Managing Director Barry Eldridge told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.      His comments follows confirmation earlier Monday that Mega Harvest Resources Ltd. has increased its stake in Portman to 7.48% from 6.65%.      Eldridge said that he does not know whether Lee Ming Tee is associated with Mega Harvest, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.      ""We're in the process of trying to determine who the beneficial owners of Mega Harvest are and hopefully we'll get that in the next day or so,"" Eldridge said. [ 10-05-04 0451GMT ]      Portman hasn't appointed a corporate adviser, but is ""looking at our options"", Eldridge added.      A takeover offer from Mega Harvest is ""one possibility"", although Portman is not ruling out that the company may be a ""passive investor"", he said.      ""I don't know what their intentions are as I haven't spoken to them,"" he added.      An Australian newspaper report Monday said interests associated with Lee Ming Tee are planning a takeover move after becoming Portman's biggest stakeholder through recent share purchases.      Shares in Portman have risen by around 13% since mid-April, in defiance of downward pressure on mining shares caused by fears of an economic slowdown in China.      Portman is currently ramping up an expansion of its Koolyanobbing mine in Western Australia following long delays due to environmental restrictions.      The company is Australia's third biggest iron ore producer, but is much smaller than industry heavyweights Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP).      Portman sells around three quarters of its annual production in China and expects to produce more than five million metric tons of iron ore in 2004.      Late last month, Eldridge said he was comfortable the company will meet market profit forecasts for 2004.      Predictions from analysts are broadly between A$26 million and A$30 million, he noted. ""I'm comfortable with that range,"" he said.      Portman's marketing office in Beijing doesn't expect efforts in China to slow the local economy to have ""any impact on the demand for our iron ore,"" he added at the time.      At about 0500 GMT, Portman's shares were up two cents at A$1.63, off its intraday high of A$1.65. The company has a market capitalization of about A$280 million.      The substantial shareholder notice filed by Mega Harvest Resources said it now owned 12.82 million Portman shares, up from 11.40 million shares when the last notice was filed.

112,Harsco Had Expected To Contribute $24M To Pension In '04,"Harsco Had Expected To Contribute $24M To Pension In '04                WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Harsco Corp. (HSC) currently has about 36,600  asbestos personal injury claims pending, according to its quarterly report  filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.          Included in the total, 26,650 cases were pending in the New York  Supreme Court for various counties in New York state, and 9,350 cases were  pending in state courts of various counties in Mississippi, the filing said.          The remaining claims are filed in various counties in several state  courts and in U.S. Federal District Court for the Eastern District of  Pennsylvania, the filing said. Those complaints assert lesser amounts of  damages than the New York cases, or they don't state any amount claimed,  according to the filing.          As of March 31, Harsco said, the company had obtained summary  judgment before trial or dismissal by stipulation in all cases that proceeded  to trial.          In addition, the company reached agreement with one plaintiff's  counsel in Mississippi to dismiss it from 2,900 cases in that state, the  filing said. Harso said it is awaiting entry by the Mississippi courts of the  appropriate orders of dismissal of those cases.          As reported, the court in New York County in December 2002 issued an  order creating a ""deferred docket"" for all pending and future asbestos claims  of plaintiffs that don't meet minimum criteria for discernible physical  impairment and an ""active docket"" for plaintiffs that are able to show such  medical conditions.          Harsco said the court made significant progress toward finalizing the  deferred docket for 1997 and 1998 cases.          As of March 31, the court has designated a total of 460 cases to the  active docket and assigned to trial groups scheduled for trial for the period  of February 2004 through February 2005, with the company named in only 164 of  those cases, the filing said.          Harsco also said that it was dismissed from all 14 cases that it was  named in the February 2004 trial group and is working to obtain dismissals  for all 28 of the cases that it was named in the May 2004 trial group.          The company said the lawsuits filed in the state courts of  counties in Mississippi were filed in the fourth quarter of 2002 before the  more restrictive ""deferred docket"" legislation took effect.           Also in the filing, Harsco said it expects to contribute a total of  about $19.8 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2004, down from  its original estimate of $24 million.          In the first quarter ended March 31, the company said it contributed  $200,000 to its U.S. plans and $4.1 million to its international plans.          Harsco currently anticipates contributing an additional $1.2 million  for its U.S. plans and $14.3 million for international plans during the  remainder of 2004, the filing said.          Harsco is an industrial service and products company.    -By Chad Clinton; Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1349;  chad.clinton@dowjones.com       [ 05-10-04 1336ET ]",0,0,0
113,Mail Money - MONEY BOX.,"Mail Money - MONEY BOX.     Lesley Collins, head of Independent Women Financial Advisers in Edinburgh and Glasgow, answers your queries      IAM in my early thirties and have never been good with money. My friends all have their own flats and seem to save each month. I don't have any real debt but seem to live from month to month. How can I get my finances in order?      MAKE an appointment with an IFA ask your friends to recommend someone or there are details on the internet of many in your area. Ask if they can help you complete a monthly income and expenditure plan and assess how you spend on basics each month and how much you can save, for short, medium and long term goals. MY husband and I are in the final stages of divorce. I have agreed to a lump sum of £40,000. As I have brought up our children, I've never paid into a pension. Is it too late to start? I don't actually need the money and I am aged 44.      IT depends on whether you are working and your income. If your total earnings are under £30,000, then you can pay £2808 net each year to your own stakeholder pension plan. As you get older, the amount you can pay may increase and you should ask your adviser to calculate the maximum each year. Until then, I would suggest you pay the £2808 now, also maximise your ISA allowance and with the remainder consider an investment that will allow you to withdraw £2808 each year to fund pension contributions. IAM due to get ill health retirement next month on a pension of £12,000 each year and lump sum of £35,000. I have an endowment mortgage of £12,000 with eight years to run. My policy appears to be on target to repay the loan but should I use my lump sum to pay off my mortgage? I could also overpay £150 to my mortgage each month. My husband earns a good salary but his pension will be lower when he retires in seven years.      I WOULD suggest you keep paying your mortgage and as your endowment is on target I see no reason to stop this now. If you can save £150 maybe an ISA would be better. This way, you will accrue a further lump sum which could be used once your husband stops work. You should also invest your lump sum wisely so you still have your capital to fall back on. IHAVE been with the same mortgage lender for almost 10 years. A lot of my friends seem to remortgage all the time. Can I do this without incurring a lot of extra cost? nIF you are not tied to your current lender you can remortgage without penalty. Shop around for the lender who offers the best rate and this will save you on monthly repayments. Some firms also offer to pay legal and valuation costs.",1,1,0
114,"Street Smart: Economy Watch -- Inflation Is Worse Than You Thought --- If the CPI does not reflect the true cost of living, your retirement...","Street Smart: Economy Watch -- Inflation Is Worse Than You Thought --- If the CPI does not reflect the true cost of living, your retirement plans could suffer     ECONOMISTS watch the consumer price index very carefully. And when it's released in the middle of each month, the response is nearly universal - they tell you it's wrong.      Foremost among the complaints: The CPI doesn't accurately measure how inflation hits the Average Joe. Many economists believe it sometimes lowballs inflation, which can reduce your comfort level in retirement.      In calculating CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at changes in the price of consumer goods and services. The bureau tracks thousands of prices, from the cost of a doctor's visit to the price of houses and cars. But critics say the measure misses some quickly climbing costs, such as health care premiums and property taxes. That might explain why CPI was up 2.3 percent in 2003 but real life felt more expensive.      Where does the measure come off the tracks? First off, when figuring changes in housing costs, the bureau, oddly enough, doesn't use real estate prices. Instead, it calculates the value of a house based on what it would cost to rent. ""Housing has really mucked it up,"" says Dan Fuss, manager of the top-performing Loomis Sayles Bond fund. ""When you look at real estate ads, you see the housing prices going way up, but the rental costs are not. It's a distorted view.""      Another snag: The index is tweaked to account for product improvements, which offset rising prices. So while the cost of a car increases, the difference might be revised downward if the car now has airbags and a navigation system. But if you can't buy a car without airbags, it's still a rising cost. Plus, there are no revisions for deteriorating services. Have to wait hours in the doctor's office, despite rising health care costs? Too bad.      There are advantages to the government that result from keeping CPI low: Increases in Social Security benefits are linked to the index, so increases are lower (and pensioners are poorer). Additionally, it allows the Federal Reserve to keep rates low, making it easier for the government and consumers to manage debt. ""We wonder if things haven't gone overboard to keep the federal debt down and the deficit down and the cost of debt down,"" says Jim Floyd, a senior analyst with The Leuthold Group.      A lowball CPI is bad news if you own Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. TIPS have been popular in recent years as insurance against rising inflation because the yield is pegged to the CPI. But if the increases lag the real cost of living, retirees can't rely on the yield to pay for ever-more-costly staples. So what can you do about it? There's no easy answer. Save more, spend less, and when that CPI number is released, take it with a grain of salt.",1,1,0
115,Teachers blasts Caisse loophole,"Business Teachers blasts Caisse loophole     The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board said Monday that the exclusion of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec from Ottawa's recently proposed cap on pension funds' ability to invest in business trusts is ""unfair and discriminatory.""      Thanks to a tax-based loophole, Caisse - the largest pension fund manager in Canada with about $140-billion in assets - and the Quebec pension plans managed by it, are not subject to the investment limits announced by the federal government in the March budget. Pension funds can only place 1 per cent of their assets into a business income trust, and own no more than 5 per cent of any one trust.      Lee Fullerton, spokeswoman for the Teachers pension plan, Canada's second-largest pension fund, said that the proposed rules will put them at a competitive disadvantage by ""severely limiting our ability to make money for teachers. Caisse does not have that restriction placed on them.""      The new rules from Ottawa will have a significant impact on Teacher's holdings, which are above the newly-permitted limit, and will prevent the pension fund from fully participating in events such as income trust IPO's, Ms. Fullerton said.      ""We will be eliminated from many markets,"" she said. If this legislation goes through, Caisse and other pooled investments will have a ""tremendous competitive advantage competing for investments with all other Canadian pension plans.""      Teachers said it is talking with other pension plans to make sure they are aware of the inequality. It said it has also voiced its objections to the federal and provincial governments.      The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board (OMERS) told globeandmail.com last week that Caisse's exemption is ""unfair"" and said it is also discussing the issue with other pension plans.      The Caisse did not immediately return phone calls Monday.      Harry Adams, a spokesman for the federal government's Finance Department, said the Caisse is an ""agent of the Crown"" in Quebec, which makes it exempt from taxation and as wells as the proposed restrictions.      The only way the Caisse could be forced to comply with the new rules would be if the province of Quebec ""decided it wanted to do so itself,"" Mr. Adams said.      Income trusts, quickly approaching $90-billion in market capitalization, have become increasingly popular because of the steady stream of income they pay to investors and the advantages provided by their largely tax-free structure.      ""The proposed legislation is discriminatory against teachers and other members of Canadian pension plans,"" Ms. Fullerton said. Teachers, which invests $75-billion to cover pensions for 248,000 current and retired teachers, is an active player in the income trust sector.      The Caisse manages assets for more than 20 Quebec insurance and pension funds, including the Quebec Pension Plan and the Quebec Automobile Insurance Society. By exempting the Caisse from restrictions placed on the rest of Canada's pension funds, it allows billions of dollars to fall outside of the new rules.      Globe and Mail Update",0,1,1
116,"SL venture capital firm creates list of top tech, biotech leaders","SL venture capital firm creates list of top tech, biotech leaders     Salt Lake-based vSpring Capital last week unveiled the inaugural v|100, a peer-selected community of elite entrepreneurs based in Utah (or with significant ties to the state) deemed most likely to play an active role in building and growing successful technology or biotechnology companies in the next five to seven years.      Officially known as the vSpring Capital Top 100 Venture Entrepreneurs, the v|100 was conceived by vSpring as a tool to recognize the region's outstanding entrepreneurs and to support and promote collaborative partnering and mentoring among top entrepreneurs in the region. Although vSpring took initial steps to organize the v|100, the ongoing direction of the community will be determined by its members, as they have the opportunity to share their insights and opinions in shaping this unique community.      Organization of the v|100, began in late 2003 when leading members of the Utah business community were asked by vSpring to nominate the top 100 venture entrepreneurs based upon the following criteria:      * Individuals most likely to lead a successful venture in the next five to seven years in the information technology or biotech industries;      * Individuals who could be the CEO/CTO of a new venture; and      * Individuals with ties to the region (but not required to be Utah residents).      Entrepreneurs nominated then were contacted by vSpring and asked to participate in a confidential online survey to vote for the top 10 individuals each nominee felt would be the most likely to meet the same criteria, with the final tally generating the v|100.      Based on initial discussions with selected members of the v|100, vSpring has decided to build a private Web community accessible only to the v|100, that will allow and foster individual and group dialog between members and vSpring partners. Additionally, the v|100, will be invited to participate in a vSpringsponsored recognition lunch and golf tournament designed to kick off the group's inauguration and to further promote collaboration among v|100, members. They will also be invited to participate in ongoing, executive-level roundtables and will continue to help identify and recognize Utah's often overlooked populous of successful executives and managers.      Not surprisingly, more than 90 percent of the members of the inaugural v|100, live in Utah. Additionally, these individuals have raised more than $1.8 billion in capital and formed companies leading to the creation of more than 7,000 jobs. The vast majority (more than 70 percent) has founded Utah-based businesses during the past 10 years.      A complete list of the v|100, can be found at    www.vspring.com.      vSpring is an early-stage venture capital fund focusing on investment opportunities in information technology and life sciences. vSpring capitalizes on the managerial skills and operating experience of its principals to successfully invest in and mentor early-stage companies. vSpring has offices in Salt Lake City and Los Alamos, N.M.

(HPC) expects capital  expenditures in 2005 to be $70 million to $75 million, according to its  annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.            As reported, the maker of chemical specialties said 2004 capital  expenditures are seen at $65 million to $70 million.            In the 10-K from late Monday, Hercules said capital expenditures are  expected to be about $60 million in the years 2006 through 2008.         [ 03-16-04 0859ET ]                 According to the 10-K, Hercules projects asbestos settlement payments  of $40 million to $45 million in 2004 before consideration of any insurance  coverage or reimbursement.            Net of insurance, Hercules spent $40 million during 2003, the filing  said.            Hercules said it expects severance payments of $10 million in 2004.  Restructuring and severance payments were $21 million in 2003 versus $39  million in 2002, according to the 10-K.            Hercules also said it expects remaining tax payments from its  BetzDearborn divestiture to be between $11 million and $21 million, and  expects to pay them in 2005.            In April 2002, Hercules completed the sale of its BetzDearborn water  treatment business for $1.8 billion in cash, resulting in net after-tax  proceeds of $1.7 billion.            In 2003, Hercules paid $15 million in taxes related to the  divestiture.         [ 03-16-04 0926ET ]                 Hercules said in the filing that it expects pension and  postretirement benefit plan expenses of $58 million for 2004, $73 million for  2005 and $63 million for 2006.            The company said it made contributions of $55 million to its defined  benefits pensions plans in 2003.            Hercules said the projected increase in pension expense in 2004, 2005  and 2006 is because of the decline in interest rates and the unfavorable  performance of the company's pension investment portfolio from 2000 to 2002.            Hercules said a projected decrease in pension expense in 2006 versus  2005 results from favorable investment performance in 2003.            As previously disclosed, Hercules said it expects making voluntary  cash contributions of $40 million a year to its benefit plan over the next  few years.            Hercules said in the 10-K it contributed $40 million to its U.S.  benefit plan in January and $7 million to its non-U.S. pension plans in the  fourth quarter of 2003.

118,Mad Cow Disease Risk Sparks Call For Wider Import Ban,"News And Features   Mad Cow Disease Risk Sparks Call For Wider Import Ban   Australia should immediately ban imports of cattle, beef and beef products    from countries at risk of developing cases of mad cow disease, including Asia, a University of New England academic has warned.    Professor John Nolan also said a database of cattle semen and embryos should be established with the capability of tracing progeny, as the lethal Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) continues its spread through Europe.    The calls, to be made tomorrow at the biennial University of New England conference on recent advances in animal nutrition, come as the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) finalises its new certification process aimed at blocking any imported beef or beef products not scientifically proven to be BSE-free.    In the meantime, Australia continues to import beef products from Asia. This    is despite a ban since January on beef and beef products from 30 European countries, and the four-year ban on anything containing British beef.    Potentially BSE-infected meat-and-bonemeal protein supplements have been exported from Britain and Europe to Asia and elsewhere over the past decade. An ANZFA spokeswoman said beef imports from overseas ``total about 2 per cent of our total consumption''.    ``Certification, when it is announced later this month, will have a number of    categories and will place a worldwide ban on beef imports to Australia unless exporters can provide absolute proof of no BSE infection,'' she said.    The new categories will range from the BSE-free status given to Australia, New Zealand and nine other countries, through Asian and other countries which are at risk but have no known cases, to the other extreme    the countries including Britain and France with active BSE cases.    Already well established in western Europe, the first case of BSE in the Czech Republic was detected last month, and another, two weeks ago, became the first detected case in Greece.    After years of claiming to be a BSE oasis in Europe, Germany has detected more than 40 cases since late last year and is exporting beef to North Korea. BSE has an incubation period of up to five years.    Professor Nolan, from the animal science group of the UNE's school of rural science and natural resources, will argue that last year's decision by Australian quarantine authorities to relax importation restrictions on embryos and semen from cattle and sheep    some from countries that have had cases of BSE and its sheep equivalent, scrapie should be closely monitored.    And if the potential risk is deemed sufficient to warrant it, Professor Nolan    also suggests implementing random sampling and testing of the 23 million general cattle population.    Australia excludes live animal imports from all countries except the United States, Canada and New Caledonia, but cannot trace 24 of about 400 cattle and buffalo imported from Europe before 1989. Professor Nolan will also suggest at the conference an on-going review of the feeding of animal protein to non-ruminant livestock (pigs, chickens, even fish).",0,0,0

Q My husband died last year and I want to know if there are any ways to make sure that as much of my estate passes to my children as possible.    FD Four Oaks    A YOU are quite right to organise your affairs so that needless Inheritance Tax is not paid, and there are a variety of ways to do this. The first stage is to make sure your will is up to date, and that you have nominated who you want to benefit. At the moment, Inheritance Tax will be payable at 40 per cent on the value of your estate over #242,000. This can mean that many people who don't consider themselves at all wealthy, but have a large property, will be caught.    If you make outright gifts and survive for seven years then these will not count as part of the estate, and you can also use your annual gift allowances to give away up to #3,000pa tax free. The rules for this are quite straightforward and it is an area that many people never consider.    Assets such as cash, stocks and shares, unit trust etc, are often thought to be difficult to deal with because if you give lumps of cash to your children as 'lifetime' gifts, then you lose control of the capital, and many people don't have enough money to do this as they may require an income to live on.    There are however, methods where you can still get an income from these assets and ensure that any growth on the money will fall outside your estate. A plan that could be used might be a 'Gift and Loan' scheme which is set up under a special trust. This could be ideal in your situation. A factsheet on Inheritance Trusts can be obtained by ringing 0800 544644.    Q I am interested in putting some money into an ethical investment. Can you tell me if the charges are any different to normal funds and are they good value for money? GR Great Barr    A The charges will vary according to which company you choose and some are better than others. Having said this, as with any investments, the charging structure is only one part of the equation to be considered. The most important part is how well they are likely to perform with your money. All funds can fluctuate in their performance. However, it is not difficult to find an ethical fund with longer term performance better than the average of non-ethical funds in the same investment sector.    Certainly over the past few years we have seen a lot more investment companies launching these types of funds to meet increased demand. Many of these ethical funds are available as an Individual Savings Account (ISA), so you can benefit from tax efficient savings as well as the green issue.

120,Personal Finance - Drop in the ocean of with-profit policies.,"Personal Finance - Drop in the ocean of with-profit policies.   Wesleyan's actuary David Rutter has spoken out in defence of with-profit life policies after a report that the French owned colossus Axa had cut terminal bonuses on some of its policies by up to 70 per cent.    Like others, the Birmingham company, have had to cut the pay-outs on its maturing with-profit policies this year after the stock market fell by 11 per cent during 2000.    But the #9,568 paid on a ten-year Wesleyan policy costing a 29-year-old at the outset #50 a month, still represents a return of 9 per cent a year tax-free, in a decade when inflation averaged 2.5 per cent a year.    The #107,772 paid out on a similar 25-year policy represented a sharper drop - 5.4 per cent - because 1975 was one of the best years in the history of the stock exchange and it dropped out of the 25-year reckoning.    But the return of 13.5 per cent a year still handsomely outstripped inflation, averaging 4.4 per cent a year.    Mr Rutter explained that this 5.4 per cent cut in the pay-out was achieved by lowering the terminal bonus by 8 per cent.    The original sum assured under the policy and subsequent bonuses added to it each year cannot be taken away from the value. So, when a life company wishes to alter the pay-out in either direction, it can do so only by changing the terminal bonus.    'It depends how active a policy offices have got,' Mr Rutter said. 'We try to smooth it from year to year.    'Our funds had an excellent return in 2000 compared to markets as a whole because we were significantly under-weight in technology and telecoms stocks.    'In 1999, we were left out of the boom, but we were left out of the bust last year. We are buying into some selected technology companies now that we feel market values are more reasonable.'    A spokesman for Axa, which owns both Sun Alliance and Equity & Law, said the 70 per cent cut reported last week-end was an exceptional case.    It arose because a customer wanted to transfer a ten-year-old pension policy to another company when it still had more than five years to run.    At this stage, the terminal bonus accounts for only a small part of the total value of #130,000. The value of the policy had been cut by 6.5 per cent year-on-year, but this all had to come out of the terminal bonus, which was indeed reduced by 70 per cent.    'If he had kept it the proportion of the terminal bonus would have gone up,' the spokesman said.    'Terminal bonuses are calculated case by case. The issue will be how long a policy has been in force and whether it is being cashed in or transferred early.'.",1,0,1
121,Rate cut may remind some homeowners to refinance.,"Rate cut may remind some homeowners to refinance.   NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Wednesday's surprise rate cut by the U.S. central bank likely will not bring about a spike in home loan refinancings to kick up prepayments within mortgage securities, market participants said.    In fact, the cut in borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.50 percent may only serve as a reminder for home owners to save on borrowing costs by refinancing their loans.    While the surprise cut lowered short-term U.S. Treasury rates and mortgage bond spreads narrowed in the wake of the announcement, market watchers said a one day rally in U.S. government bonds probably won't fire up a protracted wave of prepayments.    Prepayments, ""depend on the extent of the rally,"" said Art Frank, head of mortgage research at Nomura Securities International Inc.    Most observers said it was too soon to say what prepayments will do, but all agreed that they are watching the slope of the U.S. yield curve and dollar prices of mortgage debt.    Investors are watching dollar prices of mortgage securities, particularly current coupon mortgage bonds, to see if dollar prices jump above par, or $100.    When the current coupon mortgage bonds hit par, then consumers have a greater incentive to refinance their loans, resulting in a prepayment. The prepayment of a mortgage security forces bond holders to reinvest their cash in a less advantageous, lower yield environment.    At midday, current coupon Fannie Mae mortgage securities were up 15/32 at 99 16/32.    ""6-1/2s are close to being par. If they remain near par, we'll continue to be in a refinance environment,"" said David Montano, director of mortgage strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. With 6-1/2s close to being par, ""we are back to a very negatively convex mortgage market.""    ""If they go back to the vicinity of par, then you get a pickup in refinancings,"" said Frank. ""If we get to around par, we get a fresh group of people refinancing.""    Also, the steepening in the Treasury curve this morning promises to kick up demand for mortgage bonds because a steeper curve implies there may be a pickup in demand for pass-throughs used in the creation of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).    Meanwhile, the possibility of a prolonged period of refinancings has prompted calls for caution by at least one market player.    ""We are clearly still in a refinance environment. Mortgage performance has been overly exuberant. They (mortgage securities) are too rich given prepayment risk and you're not getting compensated for this,"" said Montano.    Wednesday's surprise move by the Fed is sure to jolt some consumers into action, said market participants.    ""Maybe a part of the Fed easing wakes people up to fact that rates are low,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae.    ""The rates may not go down, but this news might spur people"" to refinance, said Dr. Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo.",1,0,1
122,Jobs & Money - Women stand to get a better deal.,"Jobs & Money - Women stand to get a better deal.   Stakeholder pensions are good news for female workers, many of whom have been unable to join company pension schemes, says the TUC.    It has just published a free leaflet explaining why stakeholders will be ideal for millions of women.    ""For too long, women have missed out on decent pension rights in the past. And with so many in part-time work and taking career breaks, they are still losing out,"" says TUC general secretary John Monks. ""The flexibility of the new stakeholder pension scheme, due to go online next month, will be invaluable to these women. That's why we're making every effort to ensure they know all they need to about how the schemes will work.""    For several reasons, women retire with pensions worth, on average, 85% of men's, says the TUC.    To start with, women generally earn less than men, so have less cash to put aside into a pension. Women also tend to take more time out of the labour market than men, perhaps to care for children or elderly relatives, and so have less time to build up a good pension.    Only 39% of women, compared with 52% of men, belong to company pension schemes and women are more likely to work for employers that do not offer a company scheme. Many women work part-time and in the past many pension schemes refused entry to part time or temporary workers. Also, until recently, women lost out on pensions if they divorced.    The flexibility of stakeholder plans means that many women will find them a useful way of saving for a pension for the first time:    You can stop and start contributions to a stakeholder as you wish, without incurring any financial penalty, making them ideal for women who work only during school term time, for example.    You don't have to be working to contribute to a stakeholder pension. People who are not working can pay up to #3,600 a year tax free into a plan, or get someone else to pay into a scheme on their behalf - ideal for women taking a career break to bring up a family.    Starting contributions to stakeholder pensions are low - payments can be made from as little as #20 a month, putting them more within the reach of many women on low incomes.    Stakeholder pensions offer an easy way for newly divorced women to start a pension. Under new legislation, women can take a share from their ex-husband's pension to kickstart their own.    Stakeholders can be used to top up an occupational pension scheme to make up for missing years when no contributions were made. This is useful to women who were late to join schemes or who spent time outside the labour market.    Copies of the new TUC leaflet 'Stakeholder pensions for women' are available free from TUC Publications on 020 7467 1294. There's more information at www.tuc.org.uk/stakeholder.",1,1,0
123,Pension off AVC rules; The Last Word,"Pension off AVC rules; The Last Word     THE Government must review the rules governing top-up occupational pension schemes without delay.      Additional voluntary contributions, or AVCs, look hopelessly out-of-date when compared with the brash new stakeholder pensions being launched next week.      AVCs are used by millions to increase their occupational pensions. They have served their purpose well, especially where employers have subsidised the charges.      But their weakness has been exposed in recent months. They are too inflexible because savers are often restricted in their choice of investment, and it is very difficult to move money once it is committed to a particular fund.      And the tax rules are too restrictive. It is quite simply unacceptable that savers who choose stakeholder pensions can take a quarter of their fund as a tax-free lump sum while most of those who have started AVCs since April 1987 cannot take a single penny tax-free.      If AVCs are to survive, then their rules must be brought into line with stakeholder. This means allowing savers to take a tax-free lump sum. It also means providing more flexible access to pensions and breaking the link between the mainstream company scheme and AVCs.      People should be allowed to draw their AVC pension separately from their mainstream occupational pension, making phased retirement simpler. Currently the only way to do this is by using income drawdown, which is too risky for all but the wealthiest people.      They should also be allowed to move their AVC savings independently if they are not happy with the investment performance of the fund. Until now AVCs have had a clear playing field, with expensive free-standing AVCs as their main opposition.      But the world has moved on, and the Government must make it possible for AVC schemes to compete. Otherwise they will look increasingly unattractive and their days could be numbered.      * SAVERS using with-profits schemes are being bludgeoned again. This time, some insurance companies are using obscure penalties called market value adjusters (MVAs) to reduce payments to people forced to cash in their savings policies or bonds early.      Money Mail has warned about MVAs for many years, but the insurance industry has consistently played down the threat of them being used.      With-profits are supposed to smooth returns, keeping money in reserve through good years so payments won't have to be cut in bad ones.      Well, it appears that this rule no longer applies, at least for those who need to cash in early or wish to transfer their savings.      Insurance companies will argue that the stock market falls mean savers cashing in early could be taking an unfair slice of the investment cake.      But if with-profits policies can no longer smooth returns then investors would be better off with unit trusts and similar investment funds where they can see what their savings are worth on a daily basis, rather than having their returns decided on the whim of an actuary.      t.hazell@dailymail.co.uk      943259710",0,1,1
124,"Gold Stocks Favoured As Telecom, Bank Shares Fall","Business; Money Market And Share Market Gold Stocks Favoured As Telecom, Bank Shares Fall Investors sought the safety of gold stocks and bonds yesterday, as concerns about the economy weighed on investor sentiment.  The All Ordinaries index fell 12.5 points to 3276.9, hurt by sharp falls in the influential telecom and the banking sectors.  Even the diversified resources sector, strong during the week due to the dollar's slump and offshore buying, dropped back as investors took profits.  Gold performed well on the day, boosted by a strong performance in overseas stocks and strength in the gold spot price.  Leading the ASX200 higher in percentage terms was Lihir Gold, up 4c to 68c, after a number of analysts returned from a mine site visit earlier in the week and updated recommendations.  Bullish research from UBS Warburg said the investment bank retained the view that Lihir was a world-class gold asset which was improving operational efficiency and benefiting from the improving price of gold.  Other strong gold stocksincluded Goldfields, up 7c to $1.55, Anglogold, $2.70 to $65.50, and Delta, up 5c to $1.32.  Werrie Gold was suspended as speculation continued that an extraordinary meeting will be called to seek approval for a share placement at 50c a share, followed by an acquisition. There was also talk, dealers said, of a deal with AOL Time Warner and a further capital raising at $1 a share.  Telstra led the drop in the telecom sector as investors banked profits amid political uncertainty and dealers described busy options activity. Telstra shed 11c to $6.59 with 15 million shares traded. Optus was off 7c at $3.80, Macquarie Telecom was down 5c to 40c and Open Telecommunications shed 6c to $1.06.  Advertising group Singleton slipped 1c to $3.86 after market sources said the company was raising about $25 million via a placement through Wilson HTM at about $3.50 a share. The funds will be used partly as working capital and partly to cover the partial selldown of shares by managing director Mr Russell Tate.  Media stocks were weaker amid fears the slowdown would weigh on advertising revenue. Fairfax fell 18c to $3.74 and PBL 39c to $11.81. News Corp gained 25c to $17.42 after Wall Street's strong run. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 128.6 points to 10,858.25.  FACT FILE  Telstra leads telecoms and the All Ords lower as extent of the economic downturn weighs on sentiment.

125,Wall of silence over 'flexible' Abbey fund,"Wall of silence over 'flexible' Abbey fund     HOW would you feel if you had saved for retirement in a personal pension, but then faced paying a penalty of up to half the fund's value for moving it elsewhere?      That is what happened to Ahmad Salam, an investment banker, who took out a personal pension with Abbey Life.      He was sold the policy by an Abbey salesman in 1994, but had to stop contributing to it two and-a-half years later when he started a new job with a company that offered an in-house pension scheme.      Ahmad, 40, from Putney, south-west London, thought there would be no problem stopping contributions and leaving the money with Abbey Life, or transferring it elsewhere. He recalls: 'When I took out my pension, I told the salesman that I changed jobs every couple of years and needed a flexible pension just in case I moved again.' The salesman seemed to have found him the perfect solution.      In a letter to Ahmad, he said the pension would remain 'very flexible to contributions as you and I will review [it] at least once a year to take account of changing circumstances'.      But when Ahmad moved jobs and wanted to stop payments, Abbey said it would charge him 3.5 per cent of the fund value a year on top of existing plan charges to leave the money where it was, or a hefty penalty that would reduce the fund value from Pounds 18,500 to a transfer value of Pounds 9,500 if he wanted to move it.      In desperation, Ahmad contacted an independent financial adviser, Peter French of London-based Troy French and Partners, who negotiated a 'substantial reduction' in charges if the money stayed with Abbey.      But last year, Ahmad's work circumstances changed once more and he thought again about transferring his pension elsewhere.      About the same time, Abbey wrote saying its funds had become 'closed' to new business and it would not be taking on new clients. So he could not get advice from its salesforce.      Allied Dunbar was taking over the salesforce, but it, too, could not advise him. Instead, Abbey recommended on the phone that he consult an independent adviser at his own expense.      Ahmad is angry. He says: 'I have been left high and dry. No one is interested in me. Abbey has my money and that is all it's bothered about.'      French believes Abbey has let down its pension policyholders. He says: 'These customers have already paid for ongoing advice in the form of up-front commissions on their pensions, but they are not getting it. They are left between a rock and a hard place over whether to pay a large penalty to move elsewhere, or a smaller one annually by leaving the money in a closed fund.'      Abbey Life spokesman Robin Giles says the company has no plans to review charges on its policies, but says that Scottish Widows now runs its funds.      943767724",0,1,1
126,Million-dollar Partners,"Money Million-dollar Partners ""You do need the support of a spouse that is like-minded,"" confides Leonard Barnes, the author of Property Power, who made his first million in eight years. ""Two minds are better than one. Not only do you need the judgment of two individuals, but the back-up of research.""  Mr Barnes set out to make a million dollars in 12 years by investing in property, mainly in Brisbane and Sydney. He achieved his target four years earlier than scheduled. So what's his secret?  A supportive partner comes top of his list. He also did a lot of research into property and its cycles, a medium he feels comfortable with.  ""It wasn't really that hard. You need to work, study books, scan the newspapers - if it's something you enjoy, it's not a burden.  ""You need to be a calculated risk taker - do your research and be confident it will pay off.""  Mr Barnes favors the old-fashioned value of frugality. ""I still drive a  10-year-old car worth about $10,000,"" he says. He loves his old Ford Capri convertible and thinks it is just as much fun, but a lot cheaper, than a new Saab convertible.  ""There are two sorts of affluence: income affluence and asset affluence. The income affluent burn their money on holidays, restaurants, cars etc. They're really consumers - they don't accumulate assets.""  Mr Barnes admits one of the downsides of making money through property was moving house so regularly. ""My daughter had, at the age of seven, lived in six different houses. It was tough on her.""  And now that he's a millionaire, what next? ""A million bucks is not enough to stop at,"" Mr Barnes says. ""I'd like to put another million together.""  ""At my age, I'm too young to retire,"" says the 45-year-old entrepreneur, who still holds down a part-time day job. He plans to devote more time to writing. In the current cycle, Mr Barnes believes there is nothing further to be gained from property and he has diversified into shares and bought part of a hotel.  He also admits to loosening the purse strings a little now. He, his wife and daughter took a trip around the world last year and had a stint on board the QE II. ""We are starting to reward ourselves . . . but you can spend it pretty quickly.""  He has always had a fondness for sailboats. He owns a boat that costs less than the average family car but is big enough to spend weekends on. It was during his honeymoon on the boat that he and his wife made a pact to make their fortune. They were inspired by the wealthy people they met on the high seas.  Mr Barnes says his philosophy is to achieve and have fun but not to do it at premium prices. How long will it take to make that next million?",1,1,0
