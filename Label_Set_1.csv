palliative in the process of dying people with post operative infections and others with diabetic wounds She says it is profoundly draining Her home in a mature neighbourhood with cottonwoods and hazelnut trees is a refuge but only for a few hours at a time At the end of her working day she takes care of her year old mother who lives nearby in a nursing home She is understandably exhausted I enjoy the job in that I can help people but the toll of sicker patients and the amount of paperwork has got to me she says I am thinking I could retire at and still work part time Julia explains The trouble is that there is no guarantee that I may get enough work My problem is that I didn t contribute as much to my pension plan as I now wish I had Yet she is not quite ready to quit Her problem is that her means for retirement which are her financial assets a little over plus a work pension of a month at age which reduces to at CPP and OAS will only provide about to a month before tax whether she ends full time work at which she would like or which she would accept if necessary Family Finance asked Derek Moran head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with Julia She seems solid and sensible and just needs help with compiling her figures and a boost to her confidence he explains It is true that her work pension is less than it might have been had she maxed out her contributions but we can work with that problem Building retirement income With planning Julia can retire at age She should top up her RRSPs She has of space She can take the money from her cash balance of She would get a refund of approximately or which she can add to her TFSA over two subsequent years pushing its present balance to Her RRSP would rise to Mr Moran estimates In retirement Julia can have the full Canada Pension Plan benefit of CPP will be her largest fully indexed pension She could take it at age with a reduction but that would mean giving up a lot of her CPP indexation To match the age CPP at age she could withdraw a year from her RRSP She will be able to draw Old Age Security benefits at age at the full present rate of a year The plan is simple She would add a month as she does now to her RRSP to age then take a year from her RRSP from to The balance left would be She will have preserved her CPP in full and get full indexation and spread the income from her RRSP so that she is not hit with high taxes when under RRIF rules she has to take about at rising to in her s Her monthly income from age to would therefore be from her work pension from the five year bridge to nothing from CPP or OAS and from her RRSP for total income of a month before tax At a average tax rate she would have a month to spend which would exceed her present monthly allocations net of RRSP TFSA and cash savings Monthly income from age forward would be from her work pension CPP benefits from Old Age Security and nothing from investments which could grow at after inflation plus a return from her financial assets Her total income would be a month enough to support present net spending Julia s RRSP funds will have been boosted by a tax refund to but reduced by five years of contributions and eroded by payouts to That sum plus the enhanced balance of her TFSA and cash would leave her total financial assets at These funds invested to return a year after inflation would generate income of a year or a month That would make her total income a month The process of delaying CPP benefits will have both allowed retirement at and created a rising income in retirement Budget choices Julia can get more out of her financial assets by deferring property taxes of a month until sale of her house This privilege available to B C residents and older would save her per year She can add to income by renting out a basement suite which one of her children has used for perhaps a month or a year That is more than enough for payments on a new car or good used model Given her high level of present car maintenance costs as much as a month it could be a wise expenditure Julia is right to see that her financial assets are not very large But that is compensated by her work pension

6,Advisors are particularly well positioned to pick up on changes that should be made to an estate plan or the potential gaps within one given their financial oversight role For example if clients say they re going through a divorce or having a baby advisors could remind them that changes may be required in their wills Some clients may not even have a will which an advisor could suss out in the conversation Every advisor has a responsibility to be an educator and pick up on some of those red flags in conversations with clients says Karen Tzupa a financial planning specialist in Saskatoon Too often people fail to update their documents when there are those significant changes in their financial situations It s really about listening and picking up on those cues Here are five often overlooked items in an estate plan of which advisors should be aware Personal loans It s not unusual for parents to lend their adult children money without expecting it to be paid back The loan could become an issue though when the last surviving parent passes away and the executor uncovers the liability in the estate The question is whether the loan is to be forgiven or comes out of that child s share of the estate Ms Tzupa says The answer depends on the family but needs to be clarified in the will which doesn t happen often creating unnecessary friction when it comes time to distribute the assets It s a matter of open dialogue and being clear in discussion with family or even in a will Ms Tzupa says Taxes on registered investments When someone dies his or her estate is responsible for paying the taxes on registered plans such as a registered retirement savings plan RRSP or a registered retirement income fund Too often people don t consider the tax implications of registered investments when aiming to distribute their assets among beneficiaries evenly says Elizabeth Dorsch chief executive of BMO Trust Co and head of estate and trust services at BMO Private Banking in Toronto That s because the beneficiary who is given the registered plans may receive more than those who receive a distribution from the estate as taxes for a registered plan are paid by the estate and are not deducted from the RRSP All of a sudden you have an unequal distribution which wasn t the original intent Ms Dorsch says People think they re doing the right thing but it s actually hurting someone To avoid this scenario she recommends that any registered plans should be distributed equally in the will separate from other assets Shipping costs for inherited physical assets When leaving physical items such as furniture or art to beneficiaries who pays for the cost to ship it to the new owners If the will doesn t make reference to it the beneficiary is responsible for the fees says Ms Dorsch Those costs can really add up if the beneficiary lives in another province or country The issue can be solved by putting instructions in the will to say the shipping costs will be covered by the estate It comes up all the time says Ms Dorsch When we do our will plans we put in a statement that says To be delivered which removes the ambiguity Wills can also be specific about covering other costs such as travel fees for children to attend the funeral especially if they live in another county If it s silent then it s up to the person to cover the costs Ms Dorsch says Sometimes those costs can be quite substantial Outdated or uninformed executor Most people name an executor such as a spouse or family member in their wills to handle the estate when they die In some cases people forget to update their executor when their circumstances change For example someone who names his or her spouse as an executor may forget to change that after a divorce It s important to update an estate plan to ensure the executor is still the best person for the job says David Lee a financial advisor with BlueShore Financial in North Vancouver People should also check to see if the person they designate wants to be the executor Mr Lee says he s come across many people who find out after someone has died that they ve been named the executor of the deceased s estate Being an executor comes with a lot of responsibility Mr Lee says Leaving that to someone could require them to spend a lot of time settling the estate Is the individual the right person to take care of that task He recommends clients review their estate plans every three to five years to ensure the information is still accurate and as desired including the named executor Digital assets More of our lives have moved online which means a growing list of digital assets to keep track of When we pass away executors will need to access many of these online assets which includes everything from cryptocurrencies to accounts on eBay PayPal loyalty reward programs and social media websites Although most people don t see these online items as assets overlooking digital assets in estate planning can be a hassle for executors power of attorneys and beneficiaries Your executor needs to be able to access those accounts Ms Tzupa says And if they can t it can slow things down when it comes to the administration of the estate Advisors should nudge clients to make a list of online assets that can be accessed in their wills Ms Tzupa says If everything is there the executor can get things done in a more efficient manner

tax-free-saving accounts or contribute to a childâ€™s registered education savings plan, but how about flagging missing information in an estate plan?
Advisors tend to leave the more detailed estate-planning conversations to the lawyers that draw up wills and power of attorney documents. However, those advisors who are looking to add value should also ensure their clientâ€™s estate plans are up to date.",0,

That phlegmatic verdict on the share market reversals of the past few days from Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve, seems about right. Wall Street's two daily dives of more than 1,000 points apiece last Monday and Thursday might sound alarming, but in percentage terms they were really quite modest. The entire drop in the Dow Jones industrial average from its January 26 peak to Friday's close is only 9 per cent. It merely takes us back to the level of last November.
Yet that doesn't mean that shares, both in the United States and closer to home, can't fall a whole lot further. The market's obsesssion with shortterm volatility might seem a bit esoteric to buy-and-hold investors hoping for a decent retirement income in a few decades' time. But the leap higher in the Vix index, the barometer of expected future volatility, points to a step-change in professional investors' uncertainty.",0,

income and pretax universal child care benefits of a month or a month after tax bringing their takehome income to a month They do scientific work for the provincial government and have defined benefits at retirement Yet they have financial assets of just which at their ages is modest Wendy expects a windfall payment from a labour agreement Even with that their resources for raising their children will be strained At present they put just a month into their children s Registered Education Savings Plans nothing into their RRSPs and into their Tax Free Savings Accounts less than half their allowable amount and just an eighth of what they might use to fill their space They have not made wills or appointed guardians for their children We work hard to be debt free to put sweat equity into our home and to buy with cash rather than credit Harry explains Early retirement say is our goal They want to buy a condo for the children s grandparents to use when they are in town and to rent out at other times But does buying a second property make sense and they wonder what would its effect be on other goals such as funding the kids educations and their own retirement Family Finance asked Derek Moran head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with Harry and Wendy PRESENT FINANCES Harry and Wendy will have solid definedbenefit pensions if they stick with their

is underfunded even for the two year old who has of contribution room plus potential Canada Education Savings Grant allowance of per child per year before age The parents hold in cash THE KIDS NEEDS Simple things first put into the RESP to fill the existing space for the two children and add the CESG of per cent of contributions or If the parents add per year for the next years until the eldest child is when the CESG stops and for two years until the younger child is then at three per cent growth for the period the fund will have when the younger is Two more years of growth for a year for two years would add If the funds are split each child would have about for post secondary education enough to cover tuition anywhere in Canada and all bills for tuition room and board anywhere in B C They should also buy year term life insurance for to a year total for both parents In a decade rates would rise but the period of need would be shorter RETIREMENT FINANCES The windfall is really a wage settlement and will be subject to tax at Wendy s rate per cent so that she will net If that money is directed to the mortgage it will reduce total interest payable over the life of the debt by and the amortization will be cut by months Their retirement funds are likely to be just job pensions Their present jobs provide pension contributions so their RRSP space is drastically reduced by the pension adjustment Given their other needs they can just forget about adding to their RRSPs Over time they can direct money now going to child care to their TFSA Their children s needs will grow and it is unlikely that Harry and Wendy will have much surplus before they reach retirement age If Harry works to he would get a job pension of a month plus a bridge of to That s a year before tax If Wendy works to her age she would get a month plus a monthly bridge to total a month or a year Their total income would be If Harry who immigrated to Canada at age works full time to age he will have

maximum benefit she would receive about a year at rates Harry will have years as a resident of Canada at age when he is eligible for Old Age Security assuming the OAS qualification age reverts and holds at His benefit will therefore be about a year Wendy will get the full annual OAS payment in Adding up their pension components to age Harry would have a year from his job pension and Wendy would have a year from her pension for total annual income of At Harry could get from CPP and a year later Wendy would get from CPP Each at could receive OAS but they would lose their combined monthly bridges of a month or a year Their total permanent income at and after would therefore be before tax With age credits and pension splits to average income they would pay average tax of per cent and have a month to spend Their present expenses a month would drop in retirement when they eliminate commuting costs childcare and TFSA contributions leaving of monthly expenses Their retirement incomes would cover their bills Retirement before would mean a combined loss of or from their job pensions They can t afford that much of a shortfall Their present budget does not allow for purchasing another condo They have no money for a down payment Assuming that they could borrow for a condo after making a per cent down payment their monthly payment would be for years The mortgage would be paid in years into a retirement beginning at when income would have dropped It s not feasible Moran says I think the couple will do well and that their children can have their post secondary educations funded

FitzRoy describes its CMT as the smart bank account an effective and cheaper alternative to a standard account I think CMTs are going to be the big battleground of the future she says referring to the

16,But scholars disagree substantially on how Wisconsin s public and private workers compare in terms of wages Two recent studies show salaries and benefits for public workers are about percent more than comparable private workers but another study asserts public workers make percent less The key divide is over how to calculate retirement benefits Public employers also have a more compressed pay scale said Charlie Carlson a Middleton labor expert who has done public private compensation comparisons for municipalities across the state He told Gannett Wisconsin Media that local governments typically pay less than private employers to top managers roughly the same to mid level skilled workers and more to those in lower skilled positions But local market factors mean the comparison may vary widely among municipalities And statewide comparisons can t be done on a position by position basis since public sector jobs such as police and firefighters don t have private sector equivalents The solution for academic researchers is a human capital approach in which workers are compared on factors that affect compensation rather than on the specific occupation Some studies include dozens of variables the primary ones being education experience the skill required by a given job and the number of hours worked This doesn t yield results for specific entities that is addressed in a flurry of local studies commissioned after Act But it can show on a statewide basis how public and private workers compare in terms of pay and benefits depending on whom you believe Studies vary on compensation comparison Three recent studies examining pay and benefits use different methods and come to disparate conclusions Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute and Jason Richwine of the Heritage Foundation wrote in a May study for the conservative American Enterprise Institute that state of Wisconsin employees are paid percent more than their private sector counterparts State workers total compensation was about percent higher before Act they said The study showed salaries are roughly equivalent between the public and private sectors but benefits are a different story Even after Act state workers pensions are nearly five times as valuable as those in the private sector and health benefits are about twice as generous A November study from the MacIver Institute a conservative Madison based think tank said Wisconsin s public sector employees received pay and benefits percent above the private sector The study co authored by William Even an economics professor at Miami University in Ohio covers both state and local government employees but does not account for Act changes since it uses data from The two studies contrast sharply with a February study that Jeffrey Keefe conducted for the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington D C Keefe said Wisconsin s state and local public employees received pay and benefits totaling percent less than their private sector counterparts even before Act reduced the value of public benefits The MacIver Institute study differed from the others in not taking into account the size of the employer Larger companies generally pay higher wages and benefits and government entities are relatively large so the studies by Keefe and Biggs compared salaries only to private firms of employees or more Pensions key to study differences The main difference among the three studies arises from disagreement over the value of public pensions Olivia Mitchell executive director of the Pension Research Council at The Wharton School in Pennsylvania said the rate of interest used in the calculations is crucial since the pension plan s cost to taxpayers rises by nearly percent with every percent reduction in the assumed interest rate Most government agencies assume an percent rate of return in determining how much to pay into the pension fund annually to yield the promised payouts at retirement Keefe s study calculated pension value simply on the amount paid in by the employers He said the methodology used in the other two studies is extremely conservative and assumes virtually no return on the pension fund Biggs and Richwine used a rate of return of approximately percent in their calculations which Biggs said is an accurate estimate for a no risk investment and is on par with a government bond rate Public pension amounts are backed by the government and carry no risk to employees unlike a typical private sector retirement plan that has no guaranteed value at retirement Even who did the MacIver Institute study also used a return rate of about percent He said if he assumed an percent rate as Keefe did his study would have shown a percent premium for public workers in Wisconsin instead of percent No one who has a k plan would be correct in assuming they re going to earn percent on their money for the rest of their life Even said You re making a promise that is backed by the faith of the state government so the thinking is you should assume an interest rate that the state should borrow at We assumed a percent rate and if anything I think in today s world that s probably a little

17,A WE need to clarify some terminology regarding the super Your wife is making an undeducted contribution to super which then attracts a co contribution from the Commonwealth Government Your wife can continue to receive the Government co contribution while she is or younger She can also make lump sum contributions if she wishes Another strategy to consider is salary sacrifice If her income is more than a year then see if her employer will allow her to salary sacrifice her pre tax income to super This will then limit her overall tax to per cent rather than per cent which applies to income above Q MY husband is and earning a year I am and no longer working We own our home and have in a secured investment with the bank My husband s super is currently worth invested in a balanced fund His employer contributes with a salary sacrifice contribution of a month My super is worth Will my husband be able to retire at age or will he need to work until he is and eligible for an age pension A YOU haven t mentioned how much income you need to live on so it is difficult to give you an estimation Your total investment assets are including your super even though you cannot access it until If these investments earn per cent you could drawdown a year without touching the capital You would then both need to access Centrelink benefits probably Newstart Allowance which would provide you with income of nearly a year If your total income is a year it is not a lot less than you are receiving now after tax However you have two potential problems First if the investments don t earn per cent and second if you need to buy major items such as a motor vehicle If you do decide to work for the next three or so years it will be very important for you to accumulate more money to allow for a buffer over and above what you currently have Q I AM and currently rent a property with my fiancee We also have saved in the bank but no other investments We want to buy our own home but also want to buy an investment property Should I use it all as a deposit on our own home or split it as separate deposits on each home A I WOULD encourage you to use most of it on a deposit on the home you intend to live in The less debt you have on your home the better because the interest is not tax deductible You can use the equity in your home to borrow for the investment property which is tax deductible Direct any spare savings to reducing your home loan debt as quickly as possible Or you could buy your home and the rental property at a later stage The property market has flattened off at present so buying now may see little capital gain over the next few years Q I AM and have in super and am no longer working My husband is with an annual salary of and super of about He intends to retire at age We owe about on our mortgage paying a month Would it be more tax effective to withdraw my super at and pay off our mortgage and then have my husband increase his super contribution through salary sacrifice A YOUR strategy is very sound particularly now with the introduction of super splitting rules For you to have a month to pay off the mortgage a year your husband needs to earn about before tax If he salary sacrifices this to superannuation will end up in the fund after contributions tax of per cent He will then be able to split this and have it transferred to your name The you have withdrawn will be replaced in two years which is a much better result than gradually paying off the mortgage A variation could be to reduce mortgage payments to a month so that the loan is repaid in years retirement The balance of available money could then be salary sacrificed This would allow you to keep your superannuation in place while still accumulating a considerable amount of extra superannuation Again the super splitting should be considered to try to end up with equal amounts at retirement Glenn Todman is a director and authorised representative of Goldsborough Financial Services Ltd Australian Financial Services Licence No His professional advice should be considered as an opinion and readers should strongly consider engaging their own personal financial advisers Questions and answers may have been edited for length Question I AM years old and have been offered redundancy by my employer after eight years service so the amount is not that great My wife doesn t

possibly less or no benefits I am faced with a lose lose situation and don t know what to do What would your advice be Answer I WOULD find it difficult to imagine that no benefits would be available later however if the company closes down it could take a long time to receive them Ansett is a similar situation that comes to mind There are some suggestions I could make initially First visit

while looking for work Second seek the services of a career consultant to identify your transferable skills and help you seek other work They can also prepare a resume for you Consulting a financial planner will assist you with the financial aspects should you decide to leave Doing these things will guide you in your decision as to leaving or staying If you leave I suggest you retain access to your redundancy payment which will help in the short term to cover living expenses and mortgage payments if applicable,"Q MY wife is about to turn 65 and at this stage intends to continue working 26 hours a week. Her employer, of course, makes contributions to her super fund and at the same time she makes a co-contribution, which is deducted from her pay packet fortnightly.

Whether or not it decides to adjust interest rates again on April 15, the market is currently biased toward another rate cut some time in 2015.

If you like bicycling but hills get the best of you, an electric bike can provide an extra boost. All the rage in Europe and Asia, ""ebikes"" are relatively new to the U.S. So far, sales have been confined to commuters and ""weekend warriors"" in search of a more relaxed ride, says Andrew Juskaitis, global product marketing manager at Giant Bicycle Inc., a Taiwanese manufacturer with four models. Outfitted with a battery and motor, electric bikes weigh as much as 20 pounds more than their nonelectric counterparts. A fully charged battery typically lasts 20 to 60 miles, depending on the terrain and the power setting the rider selects.

20,It s an Age Thing Your age when you collect Social Security has a big impact on the amount of money you ultimately get from the program The key age to know is your full retirement age For people born between and full retirement age is It gradually climbs toward if your birthday falls between and For those born in or later full retirement age is You can collect Social Security as soon as you turn but taking benefits before full retirement age results in a permanent reduction as much as of your benefit if your full retirement age is Age also comes into play with kids Minor children of Social Security beneficiaries can be eligible for a benefit Children up to age or up to age if they are full time students who haven t graduated from high school and disabled children older than may be able to receive up to half of a parent s Social Security benefit SEE ALSO QUIZ How Well Do You Know Social Security How Benefits Are Factored To be eligible for Social Security benefits you must earn at least credits You can earn up to four credits a year so it takes ten years of work to qualify for Social Security In you must earn to get one Social Security work credit and to get the maximum four credits for the year Your benefit is based on the years in which you earned the most money If you have fewer than years of earnings each year with no earnings will be factored in at zero You can increase your benefit by replacing those zero years say by working longer even if it s just part time But don t worry no low earning year will replace a higher earning year The benefit isn t based on consecutive years of work but the highest earning years So if you decide to phase into retirement by going part time you won t affect your benefit at all if you have years of higher earnings But if you make more money your benefit will be adjusted upward even if you are still working while taking your benefit There is a maximum benefit amount you can receive though it depends on the age you retire For someone at full retirement age in the maximum monthly benefit is You can estimate your own benefit by using Social Security s online Retirement Estimator COLA Isn t Just a Soft Drink One of the most attractive features of Social Security benefits is that every year the government adjusts the benefit for inflation Known as a cost of living adjustment or COLA this inflation protection can help you keep up with rising living expenses during retirement The COLA which is automatic is quite valuable buying inflation protection on a private annuity can cost a pretty penny Because the COLA is calculated based on changes in a federal consumer price index the size of the COLA depends largely on broad inflation levels determined by the government For example in beneficiaries received a generous COLA of But retirees learned a hard lesson in and when prices stagnated as a result of the recession There was no COLA in either of those years For the COLA came back at but dropped to less than in the next few years But bad news came again this year Prices were flat and thus there was no COLA for The COLA for the following year is announced in October SEE ALSO Delaying Social Benefits Boosts the Value of COLAs The Extra Benefit of Being a Spouse Marriage brings couples an advantage when it comes to Social Security Namely one spouse can take what s called a spousal benefit worth up to of the other spouse s benefit Put simply if your benefit is worth but your spouse s is only worth your spouse can switch to a spousal benefit worth bringing in more in income per month The calculation changes however if benefits are claimed before full retirement age If you claim your spousal benefit before your full retirement age you won t get the full If you take your own benefit early and then later switch to a spousal benefit your spousal benefit will still be reduced Note that you cannot apply for a spousal benefit until your spouse has applied for his or her own benefit Income for Survivors If your spouse dies before you you can take a so called survivor benefit If you are at full retirement age that benefit is worth of what your spouse was receiving at the time of his or her death or of what your spouse would have been eligible to receive if he or she hadn t yet taken benefits A widow or widower can start taking a survivor benefit at age but the benefit will be reduced because it s taken before full retirement age If you remarry before age you cannot get a survivor benefit But if you remarry after age you may be eligible to receive a survivor benefit based on your former spouse s earnings record Eligible children can also receive a survivor benefit worth up to of the deceased s benefit SEE ALSO How Spouses Can Maximize Social Security Benefits Divorce a Spouse Not the Benefit What if you were married but your spouse is now an ex spouse Just because you re divorced doesn t mean you ve lost the ability to get a benefit based on your former spouse s earnings record You can still qualify to receive a benefit based on his or her record if you were married at least ten years you are or older and single Like a regular spousal benefit you can get up to of an ex spouse s benefit less if you claim before full retirement age And the beauty of it is that your ex never needs to know because you apply for the benefit directly through the Social Security Administration Taking a benefit on your ex s record has no effect on his or her benefit or the benefit of your ex s new spouse And unlike a regular spousal benefit if your ex qualifies for benefits but has yet to apply you can still take a benefit on the ex s record if you have been divorced for at least two years Note Ex spouses can also take a survivor benefit if their ex has died first and like any survivor benefit it will be worth of what the ex spouse received If you remarry after age you will still be eligible for the survivor benefit It Can Pay to Delay Once you hit full retirement age you can choose to wait to take your benefit There s a big bonus to delaying your claim your benefit will grow by a year up until age Any cost of living adjustments will be included too so you don t forgo those by waiting While a spousal benefit doesn t include delayed retirement credits the survivor benefit does By waiting to take his benefit a high earning husband for example can ensure that his low earning wife will receive a much higher benefit in the event he dies before her That extra of income could make a big difference for a widow whose household is down to one Social Security benefit In some cases a spouse who is delaying his benefit but still wants to bring some Social Security income into the household can restrict his application to a spousal benefit only To use this strategy the spouse restricting his or her application must be at full retirement age and he or she must have been born on January or earlier So the lower earning spouse say the wife applies for benefits on her own record The husband then applies for a spousal benefit only and he receives half of his wife s benefit while his own benefit continues to grow When he s he can switch to his own higher benefit Exes at full retirement age who were born on January or earlier can use the same strategy they can apply to restrict their application to a spousal benefit and let their own benefit grow SEE ALSO Mind the Gap If You Delay Social Security Take a Do Over There aren t many times in life you can take a mulligan But Social Security offers you the chance for a do over Say you claimed your benefit but now wish you had waited to take it Within the first months of claiming benefits you can withdraw the application You will need to pay back all the benefits you received including any spousal benefits based on your record But you can later restart your benefit at a higher amount Early claimers have another opportunity for a do over They can choose to suspend their benefit at full retirement age Say you took your benefit at age Once you turn you can suspend your benefit You don t have to pay back what you have received and your benefit will earn delayed retirement credits of a year Wait to restart your benefit at age and your monthly payment will get a boost which could erase much of the reduction from claiming early Uncle Sam Wants His Take Most people know that you pay tax into the Social Security Trust Fund but did you know that you may also have to pay tax on your Social Security benefits once you start receiving them Benefits lost their tax free status in and the income thresholds for triggering tax on benefits haven t been increased since then As a result it doesn t take a lot of income for your benefits to be pinched by Uncle Sam For example a married couple with a combined income of more than may have to pay income tax on up to of their benefits Higher earners may have to pay income tax on up to of their benefits SEE ALSO Taxes on Social Security Can Be a Costly Retirement Surprise Passing the Earnings Test Bringing in too much money can cost you if you take Social Security benefits early while you are still working With what is commonly known as the earnings test you will forfeit in benefits for every you make over the earnings limit which in is Once you are past full retirement age the earnings test disappears and you can make as much money as you want with no impact on benefits But the good news is that any benefits forfeited because earnings exceed the limits are not lost forever At full retirement age the Social Security Administration will refigure your benefits going forward to take into account benefits lost to the test For example if you claim benefits at and over the next four years lose one full year of benefits to the earnings test at age your benefits will be recomputed and increased as if you had taken benefits three years early instead of four That basically means the lifetime reduction in benefits would be rather than Copyright The Kiplinger Washington Editors,"For many Americans, Social Security benefits are the bedrock of retirement income.

36,The manager of the Royal LePage Commercial Real Estate Fund RLCREF has sunk his clients million in something safer than undeveloped acreage professionally managed prime commercial real estate the intrinsic value of which doesn t fluctuate wildly with every market hiccup Solid and stolid Mostowyk who holds both a commercial broker s and securities licence shies away from volatile investments He makes no promises of double or triple digit returns But the year veteran with Royal LePage can provide long term peace of mind In when more speculative funds were nose diving into negative growth RLCREF had a respectable return of per cent Of that per cent was rental income from the fund s five properties and the balance appreciation Even during the worst years of the recession in and we were distributing to per cent in income he notes Although that profit was offset on paper by shrinking appraisal values depreciation passed through to unit holders shelters part of the income and after tax yield is high For someone in a per cent tax bracket the effective tax rate would have been about per cent last year Launched in with a trust indenture limited to Canada and excluding relatively risky investments in apartment buildings hotels and raw land RLCREF is the country s only generally available no load real estate fund The MD Fund restricted to doctors also has no fees The fund is a partnership between Royal LePage which manages the fund and acts as a surrogate landlord for the five properties it presently holds and Royal Trust which handles marketing sales and unit holder communications through its branches While the absence of purchase charges makes Royal LePage attractive to investors they can also flee without being penalized by rear load fees Redemptions have shrunk asset value per cent from its high of million at the market peak in while liquidity has been static at million Real estate is no longer on the cocktail party circuit Mostowyk says The only way we can maintain our investor base is to convince them that we are doing the best job possible That s precisely what the Royal LePage s vice president of investments has been doing since he became fund manager in RLCREF today owns plazas in Bedford N S near Halifax Saskatoon and Victoria and a medical centre in Oakville as well as being co operator of an office building in Mississauga s Meadowvale The plazas in secondary markets were acquired in and What this fund has been doing since is tending its garden We ve got a portfolio of properties says Mostowyk We haven t bought or sold anything and we re trying to improve the value of the properties we have In the fund took advantage of depressed construction costs to build a square metre addition to its three storey medical building across from Oakville Trafalgar Hospital Similarly over the last three years RLCREF has spent million renovating the Westbrook Shopping Centre a square metre store strip mall in the Victoria suburb of Langford Having done everything there is to do to it the question now is whether we should sell it and realize the profit or rent it and continue to get the per cent net Mostowyk has recommended to the fund s five man investment committee that the plaza be put up for sale The board s next quarterly meeting is slated for June though the issue could be decided by telephone conference before then Mostowyk wants to diversify the fund further I m looking at industrial properties It s a process of elimination You don t want to be in places where there is really heavy government involvement like Ottawa Edmonton Regina Quebec City St John s or Winnipeg We re looking to where markets are recovering Ontario Alberta and B C And you want to be in a major market And that leaves Toronto Calgary and Vancouver big cities with a better economy of scale The recession has opened up a lot of opportunities for us With the fund s modest debt of million Mostowyk could raise million today through new mortgages Securities regulations permit indebtedness of up to per cent of net assets But he is reluctant to borrow at current interest rates anticipating a drop in the second half of the year If the Victoria shopping centre were to be sold Mostowyk could either reinvest the money in industrial properties distribute the gains to the unit holders or pay down existing debts Given his conservative investment style he says he would like to do all three The real estate business has never been and never will be short term he cautions I ve always told investors that unless they invest for five year horizons they re wasting their time Unfortunately he concedes the industry has not been able to communicate that long term perspective to investors The typical institutional portfolio holds to per cent in real estate he notes I think that s not a bad strategy for the average investor as well He should hold some single digit amount in real estate This core holding will yield a base income stream of around per cent The income return has always got this stable factor to it,"Mark Twain: Buy land.

Sir, Oriel's decision to remove the Rhodes statue from the college's high street frontage (report, Jun 18) is a welcome acknowledgment that his life and career deserve more condemnation than celebration. Of greater value than this symbolic gesture, however, is the planned commission to examine his legacy, which includes not only the Rhodes scholarships but Oriel's high street building itself, erected with money left by Rhodes to the college in his will. It is a little late in the day to argue that the college should never have accepted a bequest tainted by racism and exploitation but the present criteria across the whole of academia for accepting and using gifts from alumni need close examination. Oriel's commission could perform a valuable service.",0,
39,Rocker running against the tide has accumulated control of about of Martha Stewart Living s A shares at a time when other big players have dumped the stock and many Wall Street analysts are negative on the company Chairman and founder Martha Stewart is under investigation for her sale of ImClone Systems Inc stock and analysts and investors fear the company is vulnerable to a backlash if her legal situation worsens she has denied wrongdoing Partly citing the probes Martha Stewart Living said recently it had experienced a decline in renewal rates for its flagship magazine softer ratings for its syndicated television show and a lower than expected response to a catalog mailing So what is Rocker thinking The people who have sold it in large measure are people who don t wish to be associated with the controversy says David Rocker general partner at Rocker Partners which has more than million under management It is distressed investing if you will It is a surprising bet for the hedge fund Rocker attracted a lot of attention a few years ago when it took a hefty short position on Lernout Hauspie Speech Products NV the then soaring Belgian speech recognition firm As others were touting the company the hedge fund raised questions about its sales figures and prospects Although initially forced to cover its big bearish bet as the stock kept rising Rocker s call eventually was the right one Lernout Hauspie went out of business after an audit revealed it had booked phony revenues Mr Rocker says his firm ultimately enjoyed an excellent return on its bet after the difficult start Short sellers bet against a stock by using borrowed shares when selling aiming to replace them with cheaper ones later after the price drops Rocker has paid an average a share for more than one million shares of Martha Stewart Living making the hedge fund the third largest investor in the company s common stock after ValueAct Capital Partners and Capital Guardian Trust Co respectively ValueAct which acquired a block of three million shares from Ms Stewart in January has a board seat The company is still controlled however by Ms Stewart who owns almost all of its Class B shares that carry superior voting power So far at least the hedge fund s wager appears to be paying off Shares of Martha Stewart Living have doubled since hitting a week low of on Oct Yesterday the stock climbed cents to a share at p m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Despite the move though the stock remains well off its week high of nearly hit this past spring A spokesman for Martha Stewart Living declined to comment for this article Mr Rocker s assessment of Martha Stewart Living is fairly straightforward He is attracted to the company s cash hoard which equates to a share and its core franchise Also Mr Rocker without claiming any specialized knowledge about Ms Stewart s legal situation assumes the worst is over His firm has years of experience shorting stocks of companies that have been guilty of financial and other shenanigans and he and his colleagues feel the media and investor response to the Martha Stewart matter is out of proportion with her alleged crimes Says Marc Cohodes a Rocker general partner We afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted The Securities and Exchange Commission s enforcement staff has informed Ms Stewart that it intends to recommend filing civil securities fraud charges against her in connection with her sale of ImClone stock Federal prosecutors in New York also are investigating Ms Stewart and weighing possible criminal charges of securities fraud obstruction of justice and making false statements about the reason for her sale People close to the matter say the investigation is still progressing with no decision made yet about whether to charge Ms Stewart I m only aware of the public information about the case but we believed that if the government had a material case it would have been presented by this time Mr Rocker says We are not investing in Martha Stewart herself We are investing in Martha Stewart the company He shrugs off the legal and public relations expenses that have dragged down earnings in recent quarters He describes the declining magazine renewal rates softer television ratings and lukewarm catalog response as transient issues saying they will disappear when the legal problems are resolved It is understandable that sales are suffering somewhat as it is a very contentious issue unless you start with the premise that this will resolve itself The recent gains in the stock are puzzling to some Wall Street analysts who think the company is still wrestling with difficult issues Of the eight analysts following the company only one has a buy recommendation on the stock according to Thomson First Call a unit of Thomson Corp which compiles stock research data The rest are hold or sell ratings Others including Merrill Lynch Co have suspended coverage completely saying it is impossible to value the company while the investigation into Ms Stewart is unresolved Obviously some people are seeing some reason to be hopeful but my rating speaks about my concern about the fundamentals of the business says Alissa Goldwasser an analyst at William Blair Co who lowered her recommendation on the stock to underperform in early November Some investors attributed the recent bounce to factors including short sellers covering their bets and bargain hunting investors spotting a seemingly cheap stock based on the cash in the bank Others were lured back to the stock due to the lack of developments on the probe into Ms Stewart although some of these already have exited the positions In any case Mr Rocker is one of the only investors who has taken a substantial long position since the scandal erupted in the summer Initially Rocker executives were reluctant to discuss the firm s holdings in Martha Stewart Living in part to try to stave off awkward questions from its investors who are more accustomed to the firm s cold eyed approach to spotting overvalued stocks The Martha Stewart Living stake represents about of the hedge fund s overall portfolio But Martha Stewart Living isn t the firm s only long position other large holdings include Magna Entertainment Corp Sanmina SCI Corp and software concern Interwoven Inc Yet Rocker still favors the short side Of the to positions held by the hedge fund about are short The bearish positions include Pre Paid Legal Services Inc United Surgical Partners International Inc and American Capital Strategies Ltd And that short selling has benefited the hedge fund in this year s weak market The firm earned returns net of fees for the year through the end of September Mr Rocker says In the same period the Standard Poor s stock index was down The fund in the five years through the end of December is up after fees far outpacing the broader market,"ROCKER PARTNERS LP has built a reputation as a controversial but

40,Mitt Romney In an ad airing in Ohio called Where did all the money go the Romney campaign accuses President Obama of supporting jobs overseas and cites the example of Fisker Automotive the maker of a high end plug in electric sedan Where did all the Obama stimulus money go Friends donors campaign supporters special interest groups Where did the Obama stimulus money go Solyndra million taxpayer dollars Bankrupt So where did the Obama stimulus money go Windmills from China Electric cars from Finland The day after that ad launched Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus expanded on the attack in Philadelphia President Obama took half a billion dollars of your taxpayer money and gave it to Fisker Automotive because they promised to create jobs at their Wilmington plant Priebus said But they didn t create jobs for you Their factory in Delaware was supposed to be open today but instead it s closed And Fisker is still building their cars in Finland Did stimulus money go to Finland What is the financial deal between the United States and Fisker and did it produce jobs in the U S Was that deal a payback to special friends of the Obama administration What Fisker got In an American car company Fisker Automotive won a total of million in loan guarantees to build two high end electric hybrids the Karma and the Atlantic originally named Nina The goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware Work on the Atlantic is currently on hold and the Delaware plant has yet to open The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States but according to the U S Energy Department the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about Finnish workers Company spokesman Roger Ornisher says the plant has produced over Karmas so far Not stimulus dollars The claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects First the money did not come from the stimulus Rather it came as a loan not a grant or a tax credit through the Energy Department s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program That program predates the Obama administration It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act also known as the stimulus In fact it s a program signed into existence by President George W Bush in and first funded by legislation Bush signed in The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application The Obama administration was in charge when the company s loan was approved The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it Not half a billion dollars Even as a loan Fisker Automotive has not received anywhere close to half a billion dollars So far Fisker has drawn down about million and the Energy Department won t release any more until the company completes more work The government loan package came in two parts An initial million was for design and engineering to complete the Karma using at least percent American made parts A second million loan would be to open an American plant to build the Atlantic Just about all of that second part is still in government hands For those who would say there s no guarantee that some of the federal dollars were not used to pay Finnish workers the company has an answer It says it raised much more money from private investors Ornisher told PolitiFact the total is now over billion and that the money spent in Finland was easily within the amount of that private money Fisker Automotive also says that the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to ensure that all federal dollars are spent in the U S The jobs The Karma and Atlantic projects support some Fisker employees in the United States according to Ornisher He says it s much harder to estimate the number of jobs associated with the supply of parts percent of which are supposed to come from American companies Ornishers also says the company has sold about cars in the U S and that provides work at some retailers across the country Political connections The ad hints darkly that a lot of this is tied to political friends of the president Senior Romney campaign adviser Ed Gillespie singled out the Fisker Automotive deal and one of its investors John Doerr You know you have John Doerr who raised a lot of money for President Obama and got appointed to an economic recovery advisory board he said during a briefing And then his firm had a big investment in Fisker Automotive which got over half a billion dollars in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy which did not result in jobs being created in America but actually jobs being created overseas in Finland But Kleiner Perkins Doerr s firm did quite well Doerr is a big Democratic donor more than since according to the Center for Responsive Politics And Ornisher described Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers as one of the major investors in Fisker But as the Washington Post noted Kleiner has many partners and some of them are hefty donors on the Republican side One Ray Lane backed John McCain in The Romney campaign ad said that stimulus dollars paid for jobs in Finland There is nothing accurate in this claim The loan guarantees Fisker got were not part of the stimulus and there is no evidence that any government dollars paid for work done by Finnish workers Ornisher the company spokesman told PolitiFact the contract to produce the cars in Finland had been signed before the federal loan was approved Also measures were put in place to ensure that taxpayer dollars only went for work done in America Fisker Automotive has yet to open the factory in Delaware but it also hasn t received the large government loan needed to do that The ad s suggestion that the Fisker loan was a reward to a political supporter also falls flat The program was approved initially by the Bush administration We rule the claim False See PolitiFact Ohio stories online at

44,Regulators are less likely to tolerate insurers with weak capital bases having learned the hard way about the dangers of excessively leveraged banks The emphasis of Europe s new Solvency II regulations still under review is an indication the regulators mean business on capital adequacy Insurers with substantial life operations like French insurance giant Axa and Italy s Generali are able to allocate some investment losses to their policyholders saving shareholders some pain But the problem is many of the other asset classes they have invested in are potentially riskier than stocks and also declining in value So the lengths many insurers have already gone to reduce the size of their equity portfolios are comforting only to a degree Property typically makes up of insurers invested assets The likes of Axa and Netherlands based Aegon have relatively large exposures to sub AAA grade commercial mortgage backed securities much of which is U S based Axa s EUR billion CMBS has already been written down by and might face further impairments as economic conditions deteriorate Corporate debt is another danger Aegon still holds EUR billion in corporate bonds after selling almost EUR billion in the first half The trouble is over half are rated BBB or below Spreads have widened by more than basis points in the third quarter of as the threat of default increases The insurer has as little as EUR million in excess capital according to JP Morgan While Europe s other insurers have more excess capital than Aegon a prolonged recession and the impact that has on property markets and corporate balance sheets could leave many in need of capital But there s little private sector appetite for their stock Europe s insurance stocks have underperformed banks by since the start of

every asset that isn t ultra safe currencies in eastern Europe are coming under mounting pressure Many of these countries haven t behaved anything like as irresponsibly as Iceland but that won t stop foreign investors from pulling out in a flight to save haven investments Some eastern European countries could already be in the euro zone if they had wanted to The Czech Republic Hungary Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Poland all joined the E U in giving them the chance to adopt the euro from But the euro zone has some strict membership rules chief among which are that you don t run a big budget deficit and accept the high inflation rates that come with that behavior An uninspiring generation of politicians took the easy way out The target dates for adopting the euro drifted further and further into the coming decade The voters who backed them will come to regret that tardiness if they don t already With foreign capital likely to flee either interest rates will have to be raised sky

critical test case Panic has reached fever pitch Morgan Stanley s shares have come under severe pressure including a drop Thursday as investors bet it s the latest Wall Street firm to get into trouble But if Morgan Stanley pulls through it would represent an important milestone in the search for a stock market bottom At some point a high profile financial firm will survive fear stoked selling When that happens it might abate In theory Morgan Stanley looks OK It has marked down bad assets aggressively and management has responded to the crisis with realism After changing its banking status Morgan Stanley has access to wider Federal Reserve funding Also the bank s capital ratios got a boost upon agreeing a billion capital infusion from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group scheduled to close Tuesday Given the circumstances Mitsubishi has an incentive to walk away But it isn t the sort of bank that reneges on deal terms Doing so would be a risk as its recent acquisition of a U S commercial bank means it needs to be on good terms with the Fed Granted all that might not help Morgan Stanley if clients leave and trading counterparties pull back and demand higher collateral To squash the fear a private sector solution would be best for example if Mitsubishi itself offered up a big credit line to Morgan Stanley Or if another bank stepped up to buy the firm outright If not the government might yet need to step in And if that led to a punitive outcome for shareholders the market would take aim at the next firm HEARD ON THE STREET Still Some Energy Left In Mkt By Rebecca Smith A DOW JONES COLUMN Power companies that sell electricity in deregulated markets have been among the hardest hit by the stock market selloff So hard in fact that they are selling for a fraction of their inherent value The market capitalization of Reliant Energy Inc has fallen by about over the past month to billion It has net debt of about billion But the replacement cost of its generating plants suggests an enterprise value of billion to billion says Samuel Brothwell analyst at Wachovia A similar calculation by Citigroup in early October found four other companies Dynegy Inc Mirant Corp NRG Energy Inc and Calpine Corp also were selling for a fraction of the value of their power plants alone Some companies such as Allegheny Energy Inc and Sempra Energy which also own regulated utilities with predictable earnings have still fallen sharply in the recent market slide The energy sector the third biggest borrower after government and finance relies on debt to finance at least half the cost of building power plants For that reason credit turmoil dealt a blow to the sector by creating uncertainty about the cost and availability of capital As stocks slide it becomes less attractive and more difficult to issue equity as a source of capital Shares in Houston based Dynegy which owns more than megawatts of power plants in deregulated markets have lost half their value in the past month and since May One reason is that falling natural gas prices off since early summer have depressed wholesale power prices and lowered revenue projections That is especially painful for firms such as Dynegy that don t sell much of their expected output under multiyear contracts Unlike banks many of which hold hard to value mortgage assets energy companies own power plants that make an essential commodity electricity Assuming firms get through the crunch slumping values now may lay the groundwork for a sharp recovery Oct EDT DJ HEARD ON THE STREET Daily Digest That s because current tough conditions while making life difficult for those needing debt to finance existing projects also choke off investment for new plants At some point in the future an economic rebound should

billionaire investor Warren Buffett His Berkshire Hathaway Inc stepped in last month to rescue Constellation Energy Group Inc for billion Constellation owns all or part of three nuclear generating

COLUMN Consolidation is proceeding in Australia s banking sector as the nation s leading banks mop up smaller players but such signs of strength shouldn t divert attention from those top institutions funding The sector s so called four pillars Commonwealth Bank of Australia Australia New Zealand Bank Westpac and National Australia Bank are among only banks around the world that retain a double A credit rating To date the banks high credit rating has given them access to wholesale markets particularly to international interbank lending facilities which provide up to a third of their funding needs But the action of the U K government this week to guarantee term funding raised by that country s banks might prove harmful to their counterparts down under The limited funds available globally for interbank lending may flow more to British institutions which effectively have a sovereign guarantee that trumps even the Australian banks high ratings According to Fitch Ratings figures around of the top four Australian banks wholesale funding matures within months An unintended consequence of the U K government s action could be to heighten the cost and availability of refinancing for Australian banks At the same time the strength of Australian banks loan books still viewed as robust by agencies like Fitch is under threat as the country s economy slows Unemployment is edging up while business and consumer confidence levels are at decade lows A survey by Fujitsu Consulting found Australian households were experiencing stress in making mortgage payments by August a fivefold increase from March In the banks favor are signs Australia s economic authorities are getting on the ball The coordinated rate cut this week by global central banks was heralded by a basis point rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia the day before More pro activism may be needed Australia now lags behind many other countries in the generosity of its bank deposit guarantees And given its banks reliance on wholesale funding Australia should be at the front of the queue of countries if the U K government s measures to support bank funding are to be reproduced around the world HEARD ON THE STREET Singapore Economy Needs New Medicine By Mark Cranfield A DOW JONES COLUMN Singapore s central bank has switched to a looser monetary policy for the first time since the SARS virus struck Asia in This time the ailment is entirely man made and potentially more devastating to the economy The government is now starkly acknowledging the difficulties firms face to sustain economic activities as the credit crisis gathers pace Back in Singapore acted quickly to quarantine citizens who had contracted SARS to reduce the risk of the virus spreading It worked and Singapore s economy went through only a shallow contraction However the central bank s easing pales in comparison to the massive rate cuts delivered across the world this week Singapore is now in recession and few believe it has done enough to get its economy growing again Singapore manages monetary policy by allowing its currency to rise or in this case fall against a basket of its main trade partners The risk is that using the Singapore dollar in this way could prove both inflationary and ineffective at raising exports when global demand is on a downswing So this might be just the right time for Singapore to take a new medicine and adopt an interest rate policy This would strengthen its hand in everything from setting mortgage lending rates to injecting liquidity into money markets After all property values and interbank lending lie at the heart of the credit crisis Other remedies are available much of Singapore s private sector is in the hands of government linked companies Several large infrastructure projects which were put on hold earlier this year could be restarted for a fiscal boost Local tax rates while low could be reduced further they re still higher than those in Hong Kong its main Asia rival for human capital In the meantime Singapore unlike Hong Kong can t look for succor from a hinterland of a billion plus people to help soften the economic effects of the credit

JONES COLUMN It isn t just Ukrainian tycoons and bank executives who are getting burned by the stock market crash Cable TV magnate John Malone who made a fortune with companies such as Tele Communications Inc and Liberty Media may have come under some pressure The Liberty chairman sold million shares of his Liberty Capital A tracking stock back to the company for a share Tuesday according to a Liberty filing What raised eyebrows is that the sale came just three months after Mr Malone paid more than each for million of the shares The sale has little effect on his voting control as the A shares are low voting But it s a little embarrassing given the likelihood that he got hit with a margin call A government filing in July noted that Mr Malone had pledged a portion of his Liberty holdings to Bank of America in connection with a line of credit As of Tuesday the pledged stock was down to million from early July it has fallen even further since Mr Malone likely has plenty of other assets he could have sold to raise million including some of the huge chunks of land he has acquired in recent years But he might have decided that a roughly million loss on Liberty

47,A system which purports to help women help each other it is in fact a traditional pyramid selling scam and one which many women are getting into debt to join Despite months of negative publicity since the scheme collapsed on the Isle of Wight earlier this year thousands are still paying to put their their names on a heart chart as the pyramids are known There are schemes all over Britain with an estimated women involved The set up is informal there is no central organisation You go to a party have a glass of wine and a handful of crisps hand over the money and leave with your heart Once eight investors have entered below you on the pyramid chart you collect Some women claim to have collected within days The scheme runs on word of mouth most women join through a friend colleague or relative To keep it going they just recruit more friends Financially it works but only at first But sooner rather than later the scheme runs short of recruits On the Isle of Wight with a population of only the scheme faltered within months leaving an estimated of investors with nothing and no chance of compensation Even in the US with its vast population where schemes ran under names like The Ya Ya Sisterhood after Rebecca Wells s girl bonding novel WEW collapsed within a year By the end of last year as the craze reached a peak more than a dozen women were arrested for running gifting clubs and hundreds more face law suits The practice is now illegal in nine states Tracey McHale is a typical Isle of Wight victim A beautician and single mother from Shanklin she lost in May when she invested in a scheme she had heard about on the local radio station The day I went to give in my money there were five other women queueing with cash I just got given a blank piece of paper which was supposed to be my heart From day one I thought it was a fraud but all I heard was good news about it that people had bought new kitchens and had all this money She has joined another scheme the Isle of Wight s Community Investment Club with other losers and from an initial stake has had back so far I joined this one because I had no choice I had lost every penny I had she says To survive and find new recruits the scheme sugar coats a direct appeal to greed by telling women they will be helping other women and getting their own back on the male dominated capitalist system Although WEW has apparently no central structure there is literature usually badly photocopied and barely legible or downloaded from the internet It uses woolly touchy feely caring sharing phrases such as supporting other women and says WEW aims to facilitate a safe place to help eradicate the poverty and isolation that many women suffer This is the sort of language that first attracted Sharon A housewife and mother of two from Sutton Coldfield her husband is managing director of a company and they have a second home in Spain She is going through the heart chart for the second time It s about supporting each other I joined with my friend we went halves and each paid Within five weeks we collected between us I haven t seen any harm come out of it I ve seen women collect She is annoyed that the bad publicity is stopping more women from benefiting It was on GMTV and since then it s more difficult to get people to join she says Bridget from North London says she was also impressed by the so called gifting aspect of the scheme Women who have already had a pay out or can afford to be generous anyway are encouraged to help out less fortunate women by paying some or all of their share I joined this scheme to help other women make money and I can see that it works I have seen a lot of women make thousands already and give other women the chance to join But it s the caring and sharing approach that makes WEW dangerous says Robert Fitzpatrick president of Pyramid Scheme Alert a leading US authority on financial scams It purports to be a new value system support not competition giving not taking networking These are portrayed as values that women are particularly tuned into And they are values scorned in the normal business world That resonates very strongly with a lot of women WEW has nothing to do with women per se All the rhetoric used in WEW can be said of all the other pyramid schemes They always spread by personal contact you need a camouflage a story geared towards a specific group If the group is New Agey the story will be about vaguely philosophical concepts like attracting abundance into your life Similarly there are schemes in the US for African Americans which promote exactly the same ideals as Women Empowering Women about overcoming past grievances making up for previous losses getting even after discrimination Donna Bradshaw is a director at the London based financial advisers Fiona Price Partners which specialises in giving advice to women She has been approached by several professional women asking whether they should invest in WEW Women are portrayed as less financially astute and this scheme is taking advantage of that Basically it panders to people s greed although they wrap it up very nicely Some of the women seem to get so confused by the logistics of it all that it is legal to use their annual gift exemption of for example that they don t look at the mechanics Which is that sooner or later it will dry up I would really like to see it made illegal The title makes me sick You re not empowering anyone you re just weakening your financial position The women who remain in WEW however are convinced that they are right no matter what anyone says Sharon even plans to re invest to stop the cycle from ending But as Fitzpatrick points out Re investing will delay the in evitable but it can t change the maths God forbid that someone asks the horrible question Where does it all end Because that is the whole point of course it will end And more than of people who have invested money will lose it,"
Women Empowering Women - what could be bad about a scheme like that?
Plenty, if thousands are left in debt. Viv Groskop reports



Traditionally, women are better at managing debt than men. We own fewer
credit cards, borrow less money and pay it back more quickly. But
according to both the department of trade and industry's debt task
force, many more women are in the red. The trend won't show up in the
national bankruptcy statistics for another year or so. But there is
another barometer: the popularity of a financial scheme called Women
Empowering Women (WEW).

49,What Is Foreclosure Taking possession of and selling the mortgaged property is how a lender legally attempts to recoup the money owing on a defaulted loan Usually a borrower enters into default when they fall behind on a pre determined amount of payments each month but it is also possible when they violate other conditions outlined in the mortgage instrument If you find yourself in foreclosure before attempting all foreclosure law remedies available to you in Lexington KY you can try negotiating with your lenders first Call your lender right away to discuss your alternatives which may include a loan modification forbearance or a short sale if you are in danger of going into foreclosure If all else fails you can always sell your Lexington KY house fast in pre foreclosure If you find yourself thinking How do I sell my house in foreclosure in Lexington KY you re on the right page Here at Rylo Homes we share some valuable tips on what you can do with your Lexington KY property when it s at risk of foreclosure Talk or negotiate with your lender You must reach out to your lender as soon as you realize you need more time to catch up on payments The last thing you want is to leave your lender out of the discussion when you begin to fall behind on your mortgage Many lenders are actually more than eager to work with their clients to achieve a solution when it comes to foreclosures This is because they would prefer to receive some repayment of their debt than none at all Ask your lender whether they are willing to make any changes to your loan when you speak with them Ask for a grant of forbearance You might not be able to make mortgage payments on time due to a short term financial problem such as a medical emergency or a sudden unforeseen loss in income Your lender might agree to help by offering you a forbearance if they think you have a good explanation for the missed payments Your lender may agree to a repayment plan that temporarily reduces your payments or even suspends them for a predetermined period depending on your financial situation However you must assure your lender that you will strictly adhere to the new repayment schedule otherwise they might not agree Request for a mortgage modification You can refinance or lengthen the term of your mortgage debt through loan modification Depending on your financial situation the lender might accept monthly mortgage payments To be eligible for this option you must convince your lender that your financial issues will soon be resolved The lender may demand a lump sum up front or agree to a monthly installment for the difference if there is a deferral plan agreement that places the entire or partial amount of the arrearages at the conclusion of the loan Do a short sale When an owner sells their home but owes more than it is worth it is known as a short sale You must get your lender s consent before executing a short sale though While a short sale may give you the cash you need to pay off your debts you should exercise caution For many borrowers short sales are unfavorable because they can hurt one s credit score Sell your Lexington KY property fast to a cash home buyer Selling your house to an experienced cash home buyer is another option you might want to think about Cash home buyers are prepared to purchase properties in any condition even foreclosure You can receive a reasonable cash offer from a cash homebuyer in as little as hours when you sell your house to them giving you the funds you need to pay off your debt Additionally Kentucky foreclosure rules provide that you are entitled to keep any extra money from sales once your loan has been repaid If you want to sell your house in foreclosure in Lexington KY for the least effort possible selling to a cash home buyer in Lexington KY is your most reasonable option Rylo Homes buys houses in Lexington KY regardless of the condition or situation they are in so you know you won t have to spend on renovations or repairs to make your home more marketable We re direct buyers and we pay in cash to arrange a quick close For more information about our home buying process give us a call at today Media Contact Company Name Rylo Homes Contact Person Jon M Email rylohomes gmail com Phone Address Village Plaza Suite City Shelbyville State Kentucky Country United States Website rylohomes com Source www abnewswire com M Communications disclaims all liability for information provided within M PressWIRE Data supplied by named party parties Further information on M PressWIRE can be obtained at http www m com on the world wide web Inquiries to info m com,"Having your home foreclosed negatively affects your finances.

I bought a glass-topped garden patio table from Argos in Banbury in April, but in July the top suddenly â€œexplodedâ€ on a sunny day, shattering into pieces for no apparent reason. This was potentially dangerous â€“ luckily no one was hurt â€“ and, of course, the table is unusable. So far Argos â€œcustomer careâ€ is insisting this is â€œaccidental damageâ€ rather than a manufacturing fault.

contributed to a retirement plan such as the Thrift Savings Plan an IRA or a k The credit phases out at higher income levels but if you have nontaxed combat pay you should check it out However if you

65,The special session is set to begin at p m Thursday If everybody agrees and it goes smoothly it could go Thursday Friday and Saturday Beebe said The governor s call for a special session includes six bills Four will address the rising health insurance costs and one which is backed by the governor and will be considered separately would phase out the excess property tax revenue some school districts have kept and redirect those funds to the state The sixth bill added late Wednesday afternoon would repeal Act of which eased regulatory requirements on municipalities and industries that discharge minerals into Arkansas waterways The proposals to address the teacher insurance crisis includes both a short term and long term solution The short term proposal calls for using million from the state surplus to avert a percent rise in health insurance rates set to go into effect Jan Another million a year would hold down future increases I would not be issuing this call if we hadn t already seen extraordinary bipartisan efforts to help our teachers and other public school employees in Arkansas Beebe said Wednesday After dozens of meetings with legislators district officials teachers and other involved parties we have a solution that may not please every individual group but will help alleviate the spike in insurance rates and shore up this insurance program The governor told reporters earlier Wednesday that House leaders had secured votes two in excess of the needed for a three fourths majority to pass the appropriations Senate leaders who Tuesday were a few votes shy of a supermajority notified the governor early Wednesday they had secured votes two more than the three fourths majority needed in that chamber Sen Johnny Key R Mountain Home chairman of the Senate Eduction Committee said Wednesday some members finally agreed to support the plan to address the rising teacher insurance costs when more emphasis was placed a proposal to create a task force to study long term structural reforms of the public employees insurance program Several senators wanted assurances that the task force would be proactive and not fall apart or have its recommendations sit on a shelf Key said The legislative intent is we re not going to have to continue to bail out the system he told reporters Reforms are going to have to take place and if they don t take place this funding stream that we re putting in there we re going to pull those back down the road if we don t adopt real reforms The task force would be required to issue a report and make recommendations by June to be reviewed by legislative committees and all budget issues addressed in time for consideration in the legislative session Key said the panel would conduct a comprehensive review of the state and public school employee insurance systems including governance and structure board structure and funding options Separately lawmakers will consider the phase out of excess property tax revenue held by some districts Beebe said the measure would address a Arkansas Supreme Court ruling and keep the state s school funding in line with the intent of provisions that ended the long running Lake View school funding case As for addressing the school employees insurance crisis Beebe set legislative consensus on both short term and long term solutions as a condition for calling a special session Legislative leaders quickly forged agreement on using surplus funds for the short term fix The long term plan took more time It would redirect million annually to the school employees health insurance system million from general revenue million from the school facilities improvement program and million from state funding for teacher professional development Another million would be passed on to school employees in the form of premiums though that amount could be reduced as a result of reforms to be recommended by the task force Some lawmakers said Wednesday they support the overall plan but don t like tapping funding for professional development to pay for health insurance I think this is a move in the wrong direction said Sen Uvalde Lindsey D Fayetteville Currently there is a push for implementation of Common Core implementation of strategies for better outcomes for students all of those sorts of things seem to me that now is not the time to reduce the hours of professional development that we need more And so I quarrel with that reduction but I would grudgingly hold my nose and probably vote for it The health insurance rates for school employees have been rising for several years because of a lack of funding from the state and local school districts Also a million catastrophic claims fund was wiped out by five claims in and that each totaled more than million The Legislature this year appropriated million for the program In September Bob Alexander director of the Employee Benefits Division told a legislative committee it would take million in new money to keep premium rates at current levels next year As lawmakers considered ways to hold down premium increases officials earlier this month pushed back the enrollment period for employees covered by the health insurance plan from Oct to Nov The health insurance system told the governor it needed some direction by Tuesday so that it could begin preparing material for the sign up period The board met Tuesday and voted to begin the process of printing up materials based on the proposal now being considered by lawmakers In discussing the late addition of the proposal to repeal Act Beebe said that was added because the federal Environmental Protection Agency had complained and said it would begin reviewing all water permits,"LITTLE ROCK - Gov. Mike Beebe on Wednesday called a special session, to begin Thursday, on a plan to stabilize health insurance premiums for teachers and other public school employees.

Beebe said legislative leaders informed him they have enough votes in the House and Senate to pass a series of bills ranging from stopgap legislation to hold down rate increases next year to a comprehensive plan to stabilize the public school employees' health insurance system.",0,

elsewhere in Britain Wales is tripling the maximum amount of council tax that such homeowners can be charged amid concerns that holiday home demand is driving house prices up rapidly The cap is being

individual councils deciding the exact level and how close they come to that cap The announcement follows the growing popularity of rural or coastal areas in Wales such as Pembrokeshire and the Brecon Beacons These areas have always offered appealing countryside but that took on a new appeal amid the pandemic when people craved more rural space The location even became one of the most favoured destinations for Londoners seeking a second home This helped to push up house prices with average values in Pembrokeshire increasing per cent during the past year to reach according to property

that the measures could end up restricting the supply or property and pushing up values even higher North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said The Welsh Government s proposals at first glance appear laudable Any policy which seeks to make more properties available to purchase for local people at affordable prices should be welcomed For too long prices in picturesque Wales have likely been inflated by second home owners and those seeking to let their properties for holidaymakers many from London and other major cities which has pushed them even further beyond the reach of locals However markets never work as simply as that and the Welsh Government needs to be careful it isn t creating a larger problem if the change contributes to a reduction in supply pushing property prices even higher It follows upmarket seaside town Southwold cracking down on holiday and second homes over fears it s becoming a ghost town with all new build dwellings now having to be occupied as someone s main home Are empty homes a big problem In England there are hundreds of thousand of homes being left empty for more than six months In total these have reached more than properties with some being owned by second homeowners who are only using them for part of the year Lettings body Propertymark says action is needed to bring these homes back into use to help ease pressure on existing housing stock and help improve local communities It also says that an increasing number of short term holiday lets in certain parts of England are reducing the number of much needed homes to rent and buy Propertymark is renewing its call for the UK Government to introduce measures to reduce the number of empty homes It has welcomed the measures outlined in the Levelling Up White Paper to address the issue These include restarting the Empty Homes Community Grants Programme that was in place until Propertymark also said many councils require a speedier process for obtaining compulsory purchase orders on long term empty homes It suggested homes are sometimes left empty due to the death of the owner and complications over inheritance For example if a property is jointly inherited it can take time for all parties to agree what to do with it Alternatively an owner may have previously rented a property that now requires improvement work Sometimes the owners may not be able to afford the work or they decide to walk away from the properties for reasons only known to them and let them to fall into a state of disrepair Propertymark also acknowledged that in some areas of the country there are second homeowners who only use the properties for occasional holidays And some overseas owners buy investment properties in cities such as London but choose not to rent them at a time when the housing market is in the grip of unsustainably low levels of stock for sale and for rent it makes no sense that there are thousands of homes sitting vacant These landlords may be relying on capital growth rather than any rental income from their properties Recent research carried out exclusively for MailOnline Property and ThisIsMoney found that some landlords have been hit so hard by recent property tax rises that they end up with as little as a year profit based on investing in an averagely priced property Timothy Douglas of Propertymark said Empty homes are a wasted resource and at a time when the housing market is in the grip of unsustainably low levels of stock for sale and for rent it makes no sense that there are thousands of homes sitting vacant We have long called for the reintroduction of a national programme of funding because of the much needed incentive that it can provide to get these properties back into the market for would be home buyers or landlords The UK Government has set itself a target of building new houses a year but it must not miss opportunities to do more to better manage the growing level of existing housing stock that is currently being underused or not used at all,"* The Welsh Government announces a clampdown on second homeowners

77,Without the use of client accounts the wheels of business be it trading companies or financial and professional services firms could not turn And so it is with Sipps A cash account is opened for the client into which contributions transfers and investment income is received and from which investments benefits and expenses are paid The operation of these accounts is therefore a crucial part of the administration process and is why providers can become obsessive over their organisation and supervision It is very important to stress that Sipp cash accounts are not some sort of rip off imposed on the client as a way of extracting undisclosed earnings but are an essential part of the way the products function Without them Sipps would not exist Furthermore Sipp cash accounts are simply a conduit through which cash flows for the reasons mentioned above and customers are not forced to leave money in these accounts Although a client account may have a large balance for each individual client their cash holding is usually small There are two ways to operate Sipp cash accounts each with merits and disadvantages Joint signatories A separate bank account can be opened for each Sipp client with the provider s bank The member and provider are joint signatories although the provider usually holds the chequebook This way the member feels in total control of their Sipp because no transactions can be made without their signature or joint authorisation However cumbersome administration is a drawback The adviser has to request a payment so that the provider can then write a cheque and send it to the adviser who sends it to the client to sign and return or send directly to the provider to countersign and issue By this time the investment opportunity could have been missed Another drawback is that accounts like this are harder to reconcile for HMRC and FSA reporting purposes often leading to higher fees Pooled client accounts Here all client cash is managed through one client account operated by the provider However there are worries that mistakes might happen and funds for one client being used by another But they are administered using state of the art banking systems and are reconciled regularly The pooled client account approach allows much slicker processing of transactions which keeps providers fees down and assists with the provision of online bank statements Security In the wake of the banking crisis one of the more frequently asked questions has been how safe is my Sipp As far as the cash deposits are concerned the answer is as safe as they can be There are two areas of concern one is internal mistakes or fraud and the other is the risk of the bank itself failing Segregation of duties is extremely important so that the person requesting checking and authorising a payment is not the same and that a clear audit and reconciliation process is followed Bank failure is out of the Sipp provider s control although Sipps are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to the tune of GBP each including each individual Sipp cash in a pooled client accounts The beauty of Sipps as a savings product is that they allow investment into a huge spectrum of alternative options This means that Sipp cash does not have to be held in the main account and only for the through flow of funds Any customer wanting to hold a significant cash deposit or for a significant period of time can use an external deposit account at another bank The Sipp provider must of course be a signatory to the account and sign the application When funds are withdrawn they must be returned to the main provider s account So the Sipp holder has a huge range of deposit types banks interest rates options and currencies at his disposal There are restrictions as some bank accounts are not permitted to hold pension fund money and some offshore accounts may be beyond the realms of acceptable risk under the bank s duty of care to the customer but even so the self invest principle of Sipps applies as much to cash as it does to other assets Or at least it does for most Sipp providers Interest Interest paid on cash deposits is a hot topic These days this does not amount to much but Sipp providers are still subject to close scrutiny and more so than stockbrokers and fund managers it should be noted The tendency is for the provider s account to pay a low rate as it represents through flow money whereas external deposits compete for the highest rate Some Sipp providers pay tiered interest on their account depending on the amount the customer has on deposit with them although even in those cases higher rates are usually available from external deposits To manage risk and also for due diligence reasons some providers limit themselves to a panel of external deposit accounts Of course just like companies stockbrokers fund managers and the like Sipp providers can earn interest from the cash held on deposit by their customers This has long been a source of income for these firms There was a time when bank base rates were around the per cent level or higher that providers could pay their clients interest at a fixed level below base per cent below for example but negotiate a higher rate with the bank based on the total amount they held on deposit and keep the difference At one time this accounted for up to per cent of some Sipp providers income Those days are now long gone with base rates so low both customer and provider receives next to nothing Some providers that do not earn interest charge higher fees to compensate a point an adviser always needs to consider when selecting a Sipp provider Disclosure On the February the FSA published a consultation paper entitled Product Disclosure Retail Investments Changes to Reflect RDR Adviser Charging and to Improve Pension Scheme Disclosure This covers Sipps extensively and proposes a change to their Conduct of Business rulebook requiring Sipp providers to disclose any commissions or retained bank interest on their fee schedules This proposal prompts two reactions First disclosure that interest is earned has been carried out by the majority of Sipp providers for some time now The FSA has given previous guidance on the subject to which the Sipp industry has taken collective notice and amended its practice accordingly The proposals in the consultation document therefore seem a little out of date The second reaction is that what the FSA is requesting may not actually be possible As mentioned above the way Sipp providers operate just like other businesses is to agree a rate of interest with the bank based on the total amount held in client accounts The provider may even use some of this to place treasury deposits earning different levels of interest at different times based on the prevailing deposit rates available These deposits could even be with other banks which was a useful method of trying to spread risk during the banking crisis What this means is that the amount of any interest retained by the Sipp provider can fluctuate constantly and also has no direct correlation with the amount of cash the underlying client is holding at any given time Surely simply explaining clearly to the client that the provider can retain interest earned over and above the amount paid to the customer and making external deposits available as an investment option is enough So the apparently simple topic of cash and Sipps is far from simple when looked at closely However the use of cash accounts is as integral to Sipps as it is to all other financial instruments and business operations and will continue to be We therefore need to understand and embrace the fundamentals but there can be a tendency to expect the impossible where cash is concerned Tim Sargisson is managing director of IFG Financial Services,"The use of cash accounts is as integral to Sipps as it is to all other financial instruments and business operations and will continue to be for the future

It is accepted business practice that companies operate by using bank accounts into which turnover is paid in and salaries and sundries paid out. So do charities and trade unions, as do stockbrokers, fund managers, insurance companies, IFAs and all other professionals and traders.",0,

79,Esther Shaw reports WHEN it comes to taking out a new mortgage loan or savings account the adage is that it pays to shop around However there are now several providers who are bundling two or more products together and offering preferential rates to customers who take out the whole package For example if you sign up for a bank s current account you may get a better rate on your mortgage While bundling is already common practice on the Continent this trend has to date been far less prevalent here in the UK But that could be about to change according to Michael White from mortgage website Email Mortgages This sort of arrangement does seem to be in its infancy says White But it is growing in popularity and we would expect other providers to start bundling Abbey has begun offering through a limited number of distributors a switcher product range that bundles together a mortgage and a current account The offer is a per cent reduction on the mortgage rate for those borrowers taking out their main personal bank account with Abbey says White This means that for a two year fixed rate deal up to per cent loan to value LTV Abbey will offer a rate of per cent for those who take out its bank account This compares to a rate of per cent for those who don t For a two year deal with a slightly higher LTV of per cent the rate is per cent for those who take out an Abbey bank account and for those who do not If you re looking for a new mortgage you may be tempted by the Abbey deal but it s crucial that you do your research before signing on the dotted line The Abbey approach is an interesting one says Andrew Hagger from price comparison service Moneynet co uk However I m not convinced that many customers will want to go through the hassle of switching their bank account at the same time that they are moving house or buying a new home When you take on a new home you will for example have a whole set of new standing orders and direct debits which need to be set up such as your mortgage council tax and utility bills Buying a house is stressful enough let alone trying to switch your bank account at the same time says Hagger White adds that potential customers need to do their sums The savings would need to be substantial for customers to consider moving their bank account because of the perception of the hassle involved he says Elsewhere within its stable of products Abbey is offering a rate of per cent on a regular saver account the Super Fixed Rate Monthly Saver Issue to customers who open one of its current or packaged accounts Abbey is also offering a Super Direct Cash individual savings account Isa Issue paying per cent if you invest the same amount in a qualifying investment product Hagger says This could be either an equity based investment or a pension product HSBC is offering a deal that current account products enabling customers who hold one of its packaged Plus accounts to qualify for a per cent discount on its standard mortgages But you do have to pay a monthly fee of for this account and sign for a minimum of months says Hagger From time to time custom also have the opportunity to for a regular saver account at a a preferential rate and if you take loan for two years or more and let it run its course HSBC will refund per cent of the interest paid NatWest also offers a bundled mortgage and bank account deal White says This is similar to the Abbey deal offering a per cent reduction on the mortgage rate if the customer takes out a NatWest account As a bonus NatWest also reduce the application fee for the mortgage from to The Co op also offers better mortgage rates for current account customers and Privilege customers Warning to handle packages with care WHILE bundled deals may appear attractive consumers are urged to approach such offers with care Bundled deals can sometimes be a regressive move warns Mark Harris from mortgage broker Savills Private Finance You only have to look at the compulsory insurance products of the s that would get you a better rate to see that bundling is not always in the consumer s best interests Hagger says providers are relying on consumer apathy Lenders may be banking on the fact that some customers would perhaps find it more convenient to have all their eggs in one basket and es p eciall y if the y are not rate conscious he says Packaging products is preying on customers who don t shop around But while this may seem more convenient in the majority of cases this will mean consumers are not getting the best deals The idea of bundling is a good one adds Hagger But in reality it s hard to find one provider that is the best across a range of personal finance product areas This is a view shared by Harris Bundling makes the comparison process more difficult he says As a consumer you should choose products on an individual basis and select the best one for you It pays to sho p around Beware marketing tactics FOR many banks and building societies existing and trusted customers are the prime target for cross selling other products the key product is the current account Once a provider has you as a current account customer you are unlikely to switch away unless you receive poor service says Andrew Hagger at Moneynet The current account is a gateway that allows the bank to understand your spending habits This can make it easier for them to sell you lucrative pension and investment products Banks may also offer preferential rates on loans and mortgages to their own customers because they regard them as lower risk Some lenders offer existing customers slightly better deals because they have immediate access to the customer s account information says Louise Holmes from financial analyst Moneyfacts This means the bank or building society can carry out all manner of checks quickly and easily from general account management to money laundering With borrowing down in the current uncertain climate lenders are also looking for new ways to claw back lost revenue Bundling is becoming more common as lenders seek to maximise revenue says Mark Harris from Savills Private Finance,"YOUR MONEY

A great market environment doesn't make it any easier to sell a home, of course. It just makes it easier to find good buyers faster. Appraisal concerns brought on by rapidly rising prices, competition from new home builders, and a worldwide pandemic all create a specific set of challenges that can be tricky to navigate - but the payoffs can be huge.",0,
89,In a statement released later Andersen fired back As a matter of fact our relationship with Enron ended when the company s business failed and it went into bankruptcy Andersen is committed to continuing to address the issues related to the collapse of Enron in a forthright and candid manner The move by Enron previously one of Andersen s biggest clients comes as the spotlight of the investigation has shifted to Andersen In addition to the firm s destruction of documents Andersen has come under fire for signing off on accounting practices related to partnerships with which Enron did business The partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its balance sheet Yesterday yet another internal Andersen memo was released by congressional investigators concerning Andersen discussions of the Enron partnerships Enron s publicly filed financial statements included references to the partnerships going back to meaning Andersen was long aware of at least some of Enron s accounting issues The newly released memos show that in February Andersen executives held what one executive called significant discussions about conflicts related to the partnerships and myriad other issues that eventually contributed to Enron s collapse The question that Andersen now faces is What should it have done differently Accounting and corporate governance specialists say it should have done more but that it didn t is typical Until late in the game for Enron just a month before it filed for bankruptcy court protection Andersen did what most accounting firms do when up against an important client with aggressive accounting practices It stuck by its client The earliest known Andersen memo referencing accounting issues at Enron is a Feb e mail that summed up a meeting in which senior Andersen partners in Houston and in its Chicago headquarters discussed if they should keep Enron as a client In that memo an Andersen auditor laid out nearly every accounting issue that would later play a role in Enron s collapse But the participants in the meeting decided that Andersen had the appropriate people and processes in place to serve Enron and manage our engagement risks The memo cites the large fees million a year at some point in the future that Enron a million in fees client in was expected to generate It is rare that big accounting firms ditch clients There is almost no turnover among Fortune companies and their accountants they seem merged at the hip says Dan Goldwasser a lawyer with Vedder Price Kaufman Kammholz in New York Does it bother me I guess it does Andersen had audited Enron since the energy company was formed in a merger In a separate statement released yesterday Andersen said Nothing in the February meeting or the memo summarizing it indicated that any illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected It said the reference to million in fees was not in the context of the firm s desire to grow revenues but whether the large fees would be wrongly perceived as compromising it Andersen s statement added it wasn t until August when a whistle blower surfaced at Enron that we became aware that individuals within Enron believed that there may have been accounting improprieties The statement doesn t elaborate on what Andersen did over the next several months Congressional investigators also released an Aug memo which summarizes a conversation between an Andersen audit partner who wasn t on the Enron account and Sherron Watkins the Enron whistleblower outlining her concerns about Enron s accounting Ms Watkins one of several Andersen auditors who had gone to work for Enron in particular expressed worries about the partnerships and then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow s involvement in them The partner passed that information on to several Enron auditors at Andersen and to the firm s lawyers according to the memo More information about what Andersen knew could come out soon Congressional investigators received two new boxes of documents from Andersen yesterday including copies of destroyed documents recovered from Andersen s computer systems The boxes contain mostly e mail mainly from David Duncan Andersen s lead auditor on the Enron assignment until he was fired Tuesday Congressional investigators plan to meet today with Richard Causey Enron s longtime chief accounting officer and a former Andersen auditor Some observers argue that given all the questions surrounding the partnerships Andersen should have voiced concerns to the audit committee of Enron s board earlier than it apparently did Nov Basically they have an obligation to go to the board of directors particularly the audit committee of the board when they come up with anything suspicious or anything controversial or anything that could have been a potential problem says John Nash president emeritus of the National Association of Corporate Directors Unraveling Andersen s Involvement Some of the events that came to light recently involving Enron auditor Arthur Andersen Feb Arthur Andersen officials discuss Enron s aggressive accounting practices and potential conflicts of interest at a meeting to decide whether to retain the energy trading company as a client An internal memo drafted Feb recounts the executives discussion of many of the alleged problems that have become the focus of investigations into Enron s collapse The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials including David Duncan who headed the Enron account August Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins a former Andersen employee writes anonymously to Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay with concerns about potential conflicts of interest and accounting practices Aug Date of according to a second memo by another Andersen executive a phone conversation between Watkins and an Andersen employee who relays the issues to senior Andersen management including Duncan Fall Vinson Elkins Enron s law firm conducts a preliminary investigation into Watkins s charges Oct E mail by in house Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple reminds risk management partner Michael Odom of document and retention policy Temple later tells Andersen that she intended to refer only to work in progress Dec Enron files for bankruptcy court protection Investigators focus on Andersen s role Jan Andersen discloses to investigators that a significant but undetermined number of documents relating to the Enron audit had been destroyed in recent months Jan Andersen fires Duncan saying that he led an expedited effort to destroy documents after he learned that Enron had received a request for information from the SEC about its financial accounting and reporting Jan Duncan is questioned by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department mostly about the February memo Duncan tells the investigators he called the February meeting because he was aware the Enron account posed significant risk according to one person present during the questioning Jan Enron fires Arthur Andersen Source The Wall Street Journal Online See related article Enron Crisis Puts Spotlight On the FASB WSJ Jan,"
The once-cozy relationship between Enron Corp. and its auditor blew up
in a storm of recriminations yesterday amid questions about what
Andersen should have done about questionable practices at the energy
company.



Enron's board fired its longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. While
it said it wanted to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt during the
investigation, ""we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent
events, including the reported destruction of documents by Andersen
personnel and the disciplinary actions taken against several of
Andersen's partners working in its Houston office.""

90,For many students the answer to that question lies in some form of student loans However the amount of loans currently outstanding is daunting as of January outstanding student debt was at trillion That s billion larger than the outstanding auto loans trillion larger than the level of outstanding credit card debt and equivalent to percent of U S gross domestic product What form do these loans take Unlike with most debt products the majority of student loans are created and held by federal banks Of that trillion dollar market percent is composed of federal student loans The remaining percent comes from a mix of private banks and loan agencies When deciding how to select a student loan the biggest consideration should be given to the interest rate Many private loans have variable rates meaning the interest you pay differs depending on an economic indicator of the loan creator s choosing usually the London Interbank Offered Rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate These indicators are used to determine most of the loan rates around the world and they usually increase with fears around inflation Now this can be highly beneficial if you want to have low interest rates as rates can drop extremely low in certain economic conditions and lead to a cheaper loan payment However the rate can also swing upward and your loan payment can end up being much higher than expected Currently possible interest rates on variable rate private loans range from percent to percent With federal loans a fixed interest rate is used This fixed rate is set by Congress and does not change over the lifetime of the loan This fixed rate is set by taking the yield on a year Treasury note and adding a management fee with the fee being lower for undergraduate borrowers and higher for graduate students and parents Currently the undergraduate rate is set to percent graduate to percent and parents to percent In suit with the private loans the year Treasury note yield also increases with inflationary fear Inflation also affects the real rates of the loans The real rate is the inflation adjusted rate for your loan For example if you had a loan with an interest rate of percent and inflation is percent over the time of repayment then the real rate of your loan is percent This may benefit borrowers with fixed rates as inflation can slowly eat away at interest paid Variable rates however adjust with inflation leading to no real rate benefit So if you re relatively risk averse and want to know how much your loans are going to cost make sure to stick with a federal loan or a private fixed loan Otherwise you could be stuck paying much more than you had expected or planned for if inflation fears rapidly increase chief goon opinion dailytarheel com,"As the average cost of tuition grows by 6.8 percent per year, attending college has become an increasingly expensive proposition.

executive director of the Investment Adviser Association Again our first speaker now delivering her opening statement Barbara Roper director of investor protection with the Consumer Federation of America ROPER Thank you for joining us today for the release of a survey that we believe can and should help to lay the foundation for a new pro investor approach to the regulation of brokers and investment advisers Toward that end our organizations have submitted the survey findings to the Securities and Exchange Commission today for consideration as part of the study it is currently conducting of the standards of care that apply to brokers and investment advisers when they give advice about and recommend securities to retail investors A later speaker will go over the survey findings in detail I d like to focus on their policy implications which we believe are significant What is at stake is whether brokers will be held to the same fiduciary duty to act on the best interests of their customers that all other investment advisers are held to The survey findings we are releasing today respond to two of the questions that Congress directed the SEC to answer as part of its study Whether retail investors understand that there are different standards of care for investment advice by brokers and advisers and whether the existence of different standards of care is a source of confusion Like similar studies conducted previously our survey confirms that investors are basically clueless when it comes to the different standards that apply to brokers and investment advisers To be specific they don t even understand the differences between the services provided by brokers investment advisers and financial planners let alone that they are subject to different legal obligations to the client when they perform the same investment advisory services This lack of understanding is not because investors are stupid it is bluntly stated because the policy itself is stupid No one in their right mind would create a system in which individuals who call themselves by titles and offer services that are indistinguishable to the average investor are subject to two different standards when they do so But this is precisely the world that SEC policy over the past two decades has helped to create It is the result for example of the agency s decision to allow brokers to call their sales reps financial advisers and financial consultants without regulating them as advisers and to allow them to offer services such as financial planning and investment planning without regulating them as the advisory services they clearly are Now Congress has given the agency a chance to fix those past errors by imposing the Investment Advisors Act fiduciary duty on all financial professionals when they give investment advice or recommend securities If the SEC follows through on that directive investors would receive the added assurance of knowing that all those who give them investment advice have to make recommendations that they have a reasonable basis for believing are in the best interests of the client And investors will be warned up front of conflicts of interest that could bias those recommendations That is what our survey shows investors want and expect But that policy still faces a significant headwind of industry opposition Although the mainstream broker dealer groups have come around to the point that they now embrace the concept of a fiduciary standard for advice they advocate a narrow rules based approach that if adopted would vitiate the fiduciary standard The insurance trade associations meanwhile continue to argue disingenuously but vigorously that investors would suffer if insurance agents were held to a fiduciary standard when recommending securities That is a view that as our survey results make clear investors themselves overwhelmingly reject What remains to be seen is whether the SEC will capitalize on the opportunity it has been given reject industry efforts to weaken the standard and at long last put investors interests first by holding brokers and investment advisers alike to the full principles based Investment Advisers Act fiduciary duty when they give investment advice and recommend securities There are positive signs The administration and leaders of the SEC including SEC Chairman Mary Shapiro supported legislation to impose a fiduciary duty on brokers which support was crucial to the provisions ultimate passage over industry opposition We re hopeful that this represents a real change in direction at the SEC In that spirit we look forward to working with the agency both as it conducts the study and as it develops proposals based on the study findings to ensure that those policies achieve the outcome that investors both deserve and expect investment advice and recommendations designed to serve their best interests and not simply the financial interests of the firm or individual offering that advice Thank you MODERATOR That was the opening statement of our first speaker Barbara Roper who is director of investor protection with the Consumer Federation of America At this time we re going to proceed to our second speaker Texas Securities Commissioner Denise Voigt Crawford who is president of the North American Securities Administrators Association CRAWFORD Good afternoon and thank you so much for joining us here today In a few minutes you re going to hear the results of a new survey of investors that will demonstrate what we ve been saying for many years now Investors who receive advice about securities logically expect their interests to come first When the SEC launched its comment period regarding the obligations of broker dealers and investment advisers Chairman Mary Schapiro said regulations work best when stakeholders are engaged and investors are offering ideas and alternatives As the comment period drew to a close more than responses had been sent to the agency Many of these comments however were clearly the result of industry funded campaigns designed to jam the SEC s inboxes and drown out the voices of investors with the same tired rhetoric that was used to influence Congress during the debate on extending the fiduciary duty of care to brokers and insurance agents in the Dodd Frank Act As you can imagine most of the investors who come into my office and those of my colleagues around the country with complaints about brokers or advisers are not the type to fire off letters to the SEC They re busy raising families and trying to make ends meet But when it comes to this issue they know what they want and we all know what they deserve When asked they will tell you that they expect a fair deal when they get advice about their investments Who wouldn t If you ask them what they consider to be fair their answer is invariably straightforward They expect their interests to come first when they receive advice about what to do with their money Plain and simple it does not matter to them who is providing the advice The standard needs to be put the investor first In a few minutes you re going to hear confirmation of this fact as we outline the survey results But I just want to tell you that the findings you will hear about are highly consistent with what my colleagues and state securities agencies throughout the United States have heard for many years now The Dodd Frank Act gives the SEC unprecedented rulemaking opportunities to achieve both the commissions and state securities regulators overarching goal of putting investors first Because we see the devastating effects of what happens when the interests of investors are pushed into the background state securities regulators have consistently urged policymakers to give investors what they have long deserved And that is to require that everyone who provides investment advice be held to the fiduciary duty currently applicable to investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of Unlike investment advisers broker dealers are not required to put investor interests ahead of their own in this context This means that brokers are not required to disclose to investors critical features of the investments they sell including such things as cost commissions ph and conflicts of interest associated with these investments which results in a significant regulatory and investor protection gap The SEC now has the opportunity to close this gap and fulfill congressional intent by extending the fiduciary duty of care under the Investment Advisers Act of to all financial professionals regardless of what they call themselves who actually provide personalized investment advice to their retail clients The SEC has the authority to do so once it completes its ongoing study of the obligations of brokers and investment advisers You might recall that the RAND Corporation s exhaustive study for the SEC made it abundantly clear that the invested public is very confused about the distinctions between broker dealers and investment advisers and that they mistakenly believe that brokers already act as fiduciaries The same story has been repeated by investor and consumer advocates in congressional hearings over the past two years Today s survey results confirm these findings We strongly encourage the SEC to listen to the voice of investors as expressed in this survey and to do the right thing Bring the fiduciary duty of the Investment Advisers Act to those who provide investment advice about securities Thank you MODERATOR That was the opening statement of our second speaker You just heard the comments of Texas Securities Commissioner Denise Voigt Crawford president of the North American Securities Administrators Association We will now proceed to Mary Wallace who is senior legislative representative with the Economic Security Team in the Government Relations and Advocacy Department at AARP WALLACE Thank you Some people in the securities and insurance industries would have you believe that the issues being discussed today about the appropriate regulatory standard for investment advisers and brokers is complicated and in need of more study But from the investor s perspective ph it s actually quite simple All financial professionals who offer investment advice should be held to a fiduciary standard when they offer that advice Investment advisers are in the business of giving advice Brokers traditionally were in the business of selling products Increasingly over the past decades however brokers have transformed themselves into advisers They call themselves financial advisers and offer services such as investment planning that clearly is advisory in nature and they market themselves based on the advice that they offer The survey released today demonstrates that investors do not understand these basic differences and shouldn t be expected to in light of industry practices that actually promote that confusion Research also demonstrates that investors who do not understand the differences between brokers and advisers also rely heavily on the recommendations that they receive from these folks making them vulnerable to sales pitches that actually masquerade as objective advice AARP s view is that it makes no sense to disadvantage investors with a two tiered regulatory structure that offers fewer protections and weaker disclosure just because they happen to get their investment advice from a stockbroker or an insurance agent selling investment products To AARP it just makes sense If one person does the same thing as another person they should be regulated in the same way If one person is required to act in the client s best interest and disclose conflicts of interest then another person doing the same thing should be required to make the same kind of disclosures to consumers and adhere to the same standard of conduct Today most investors rely on a professional whether it s a broker financial planner or an investment adviser to help them make the financial decisions upon which their retirement security and long term saving success depends In today s world of do it yourself retirement planning stocks bonds mutual funds and other investment products have become an increasingly important component of an individual s retirement portfolio AARP knows that older investors frequently are targets of improper sales practices While investment fraud hurts people of all ages older people feel the impact more acutely because they have fewer opportunities and less time to recoup their losses Integrity in the insurance markets and fulfillment of fiduciary duties by various professionals on whom investors rely are more important today than ever During congressional consideration of the wide ranging Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform Bill AARP identified just a handful of key priorities for our membership Updating our securities laws so that all financial professionals who offer investment advice are subject to the Investment Advisors Act fiduciary standing was and remains a top priority In the best of times middle income Americans who are most vulnerable to deceptive sales tactics can ill afford the high cost they pay as a result of these practices As investors seek to recover from the devastating losses they suffered in the recent financial crisis the need for action is even more urgent AARP urges the SEC to use the authority they now have been given under the new Dodd Frank law to close the regulatory gap that currently exists and to adopt a fiduciary duty for any financial professional providing investment advice to retail investors Thank you MODERATOR That was the opening statement of our third speaker You just heard the comments of Mary Wallace senior legislative representative of the Economic Security Team in the Government Relations and Advocacy Department at AARP That takes us to our fourth speaker Graham Hueber who is senior researcher with Infogroup ORC Graham HUEBER Good afternoon My name is Graham Hueber and I m a senior researcher at Infogroup ORC I ve been asked to summarize the key findings of the survey that you ve been hearing about from the previous three speakers The Infogroup ORC survey was conducted August the th to the rd of this year among a sample of adults comprising men and women who are years of age and older living in the continental United States From that sample we ended up with respondents who identified themselves as investors More applicable results for some questions were compared to similar telephone surveys of investors that were conducted in and Our completed interviews were weighted by four variables age gender region and race to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the total population years of age and older The margin of error for results based on the total sample is plus or minus three percentage points The key takeaway points from the survey are as follows Nine out of ten U S investors or percent think that quote A stockbroker and an investment adviser who provide the same kind of investment advisory services should have to follow the same investor protection rules Nearly all investors or percent agree that when you receive investment advice from a financial professional the person providing the advice should put your interests ahead of theirs and should have to tell you up front about any fees or commissions they earn and any conflicts of interest that potentially could influence that advice Again nearly all investors or percent of those we spoke with agree that the fiduciary requirement should extend to insurance agents who are selling investments At the same time as you ve heard before there is widespread misunderstanding about which financial professionals are held to the fiduciary standard Three out of five U S investors mistakenly think that quote insurance agents unquote have a fiduciary duty to their clients Two out of three U S investors are incorrect in thinking that stockbrokers are held to a fiduciary duty And percent of investors are wrong in believing that financial advisers a term used by brokerage firms to describe their salespeople are held to a fiduciary duty By contrast percent of investors think the fiduciary standard is in place for financial planners and percent say the same about investment advisers We also found that over three out of five American investors mistakenly believe that stockbrokers are investment advisers And here is how that breaks down Roughly a third of investors incorrectly think that financial advice is the primary service offered by stockbrokers Another percent believe that advice and assistance in conducting transactions are equally important services offered by brokers Only about three investors or percent get it right and understand that the primary service of stockbrokers is to buy and sell stocks bonds mutual funds and other investment product on behalf of their clients and they give only limited advice that is directly related to those transactions That s a quick overview of the key survey findings which show frankly no real improvement based on our earlier survey work on this same topic conducted in and for the Consumer Federation of America I m going to end my remarks there but please check out the full survey report online and feel free to ask me any questions during the Q A period Thank you MODERATOR That was the opening statement of our fourth speaker Graham Hueber senior researcher with Infogroup ORC I want to stress that the survey results the full report that Graham referred to as well as related news release are now available to you on the Web at hastingsgroup com fiduciarysurvey as one word Again that s hastingsgroup com fiduciarysurvey We ll be repeating that information during the Q A period but at this time let s proceed to our fifth of six of six speakers His name is Robert Glovsky He is chair of the Board of Directors of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards and president of Mintz Levin Financial Advisors in Boston GLOVSKY Thank you and thank you everyone for joining us today I m Bob Glovsky chair of the Board of Directors of Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards or CFP Board Today I m representing the Financial Planning Coalition The coalition consists of three leading financial planning organizations CFP Board the Financial Planning Association and the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors Together we represent over stakeholders across the country who have voluntarily embraced a client first standard of care either because they are certified with CFP Board of Standards or adhere to the FPA or NAPFA codes of conduct We offer unique industry perspective on the survey findings because our stakeholders who include investment advisers broker dealers insurance producers deliver financial planning services at a fiduciary standard of care Significantly CFP Board and FPA are a business model and compensation neutral Consequently certified financial planner professionals and FPA members operate under a variety of business models including brokerage and insurance models and different fee structures including commission based fee structures Yet they have been able within these various business models and fee structures to successfully deliver financial planning services under a client first standard of care While this often requires full and fair disclosure of conflicts of interest ensuring that the client has full ability to understand and evaluate information and recommendations and securing fully informed client consent It does not require abandoning their brokerage or insurance business models Our experience is strong evidence that the fiduciary standard is a practical flexible and workable standard no matter if the adviser is a stockbroker insurance agent investment adviser or financial planner Some opponents of the fiduciary standard argue that requiring a client first standard will hurt consumers by increasing costs and reducing services Our experience is just the opposite Providing services with fiduciary accountability is good for the customer and good for business There has been a steady increase in the number of investment advisers in recent years while the number of broker dealers has steadily decreased and in this case even though investment advisers are required to comply with the fiduciary standard of care Today s survey results verify our own experience and this trend Ninety seven percent percent of investors want and expect advice from financial professionals who put their interests first Modifying or watering down the fiduciary standard to accommodate different business models is not necessary and would completely frustrate investors clear and unanimous demand for a client first standard We urge the SEC to consider this overwhelming investor data and find that a strong and uniform standard a strong and uniform fiduciary standard of care for the delivery of investment advice serves the public interest Thank you MODERATOR And that was the opening statement of Robert Glovsky chair of the Board of Directors of the Certified Financial Board of Standards and president of Mintz Levin Financial Advisors in Boston We will now proceed to our final speaker before the Q A period David Tittsworth executive director of the Investment Adviser Association TITTSWORTH Thank you The Investment Adviser Association is really pleased to join with consumer groups state securities regulators and financial planning groups in presenting the results of this important survey today Our groups obviously represent a very broad and diverse range of interests but we ve certainly found that we share common ground on matters relating to the fiduciary duty standard This survey directly responds to questions the SEC is required to study Section of the Dodd Frank law requires the SEC to quote assess the effectiveness of existing legal or regulatory standards of care for broker dealers and investment advisers when they provide personalized investment advice to retail customers The SEC only has six months to complete this study and the clock is already ticking At the end of those six months the SEC has to submit a written report to Congress along with its findings conclusions and recommendations In conducting the study Section requires the SEC to seek input from the public and that s why this survey is so compelling The investors survey answers key questions the SEC has to address under the terms of the legislation whether retail customers understand that there are different standards of care for brokers and investment advisers and whether the different standards are a source of confusion to retail customers The answers to those questions are absolutely crystal clear Average investors simply do not understand the different standards of care for brokers and investment advisers and they re understandably confused about those different standards The good news is that the SEC now has an opportunity to clear up this confusion and ensure that investors have the facts they need to make an informed decision when they seek help from investment professionals I want to emphasize that the fiduciary duty under the advisers act that all of our groups have spoken about is very well established and that the SEC should not weaken it or water it down Our organization was founded in and we participated in the congressional deliberations that led to the enactment of the Investment Advisers Act in In the U S Supreme Court definitively ruled that the advisers act imposes a fiduciary duty on investment advisers For decades the courts and the SEC have consistently upheld this federal fiduciary standard And what is the advisers act fiduciary duty At its core it requires investment advisers to place the interest of their clients first and always ahead of their own self interest It arises because there s a relationship of trust that comes about when investors seek advice about security The fiduciary duty requires investment advisers to treat their clients fairly and to disclose all material facts particularly about potential conflicts of interest including compensation arrangements When Deni ph Crawford and I testified before the House Financial Services Committee a year ago every witness at our table including representatives of the brokerage and insurance industries agreed that the advisers act fiduciary duty is a higher standard of care than the suitability requirement for brokers The advisers act fiduciary duty is not broken it doesn t need to be fixed It should not be weakened or watered down We don t need some new standard that would take decades to implement After the SEC completes its study Section of the Dodd Frank Bill specifically authorizes the SEC to issue regulations regarding the standard of conduct for brokers and investment advisers who provide personalized investment advice to retail customers Based on our experience and based on the clear results of this survey we re discussing today we strongly urge the SEC to issue regulations that will extend the advisers act fiduciary duty to others who provide investment advice Thank you and I d be pleased to answer any questions MODERATOR That s the opening statement of our final speaker today before the Q A period begins His name is David Tittsworth executive director of the Investment Adviser Association And that concludes our opening statements We ll now proceed to the Q A period What I d like to do is invite the operator back on the line to explain how the Q A period will work for members of the media OPERATOR At this time if you would like to ask a question please press star then one on your touchtone phone If you decide to withdraw your question please press star then two to remove yourself from the list Please limit yourself to one question and a single follow up If you need to ask an additional question please know that you may press star then one to rejoin the queue MODERATOR And we ll have the operator back on the line as necessary during the Q A period to repeat those instructions While we re waiting for our first question I do want to make sure that you know again that you can find the full survey report the analysis of the survey and the topline survey results the full survey instrument as well as related news release online at hastingsgroup com fiduciarysurvey Again hastingsgroup com fiduciarysurvey It s also available by contacting Patrick Mitchell ph at Again that s Patrick Mitchell ph at Operator at this time let s proceed to our first question OPERATOR First question comes from Mark Schoeff ph of Investment News Please go ahead QUESTION All right Yes thank you for taking my question and thank you for holding this this this presser ph One of the points that was brought up by broker dealers and insurance groups in the in their letters to the SEC is that broker dealers and insurance agents are often in in small communities and sort of in middle America and that in these communities there s a moral suasion ph of sorts because these folks have to see their clients or potential clients at church at high school basketball games and so on and so forth Is do you do you sort of dismiss that argument Does that that not hold water that they re sort of in and of of these communities and that is is effectively a a high standard of care ROPER This is Barb Roper with CFA I m sure others will have comments as well But I mean I don t think there s any basis for arguing that the level of investor protection should be based on whether the particular securities broker meets the person at church on Sunday morning There s a basic issue of what standards should apply to advice and the clear consensus among investors is that that standard is the fiduciary duty Beyond that there s overwhelming evidence of you know pervasive abusive sales practices in the sale of variable annuities in particular which is the practice that typically brings insurance agents into the fold as potentially subject to the fiduciary duty It s hard to imagine an area where we would see more benefit from the imposition ph of a fiduciary than in this in this one particular area of sales of variable annuities So the evidence just doesn t support the context the the doesn t support the contention that the existing system is providing adequate protections GLOVSKY You know Mark this is Bob Glovsky from CFP Board I m not sure that I have a that I see the conflict if you will in their in their position The reality is that if if they feel like they are currently behaving as fiduciaries because they see their friends and neighbors all the time Great Then their business model doesn t change And we ve said before we re business model neutral we re compensation neutral There s no reason why they can t operate under a fiduciary standard And may be the fact that they already are so in their minds I look at it and I say well gee that s easy for them to do MODERATOR Is there is there a follow up question or anyone else who wants to comment on that question CRAWFORD This is Deni ph Crawford and I d just like to add that as a securities regulator in a state with a very large rural population I I have to say that community standards in small towns as opposed to large cities don t seem to be doing the job And I think that we ve got to actually have the laws on the books This notion of self regulation or the notion that somehow o,,0,
 other the opinion of one s friends and neighbors is going to offset a tendency to put one s own interests first as opposed to the interest of the client  I think it might be a little bit naive for us to rely on that  And certainly as a securities regulator  I could never endorse it   QUESTION  Yes   CRAWFORD  It s a good question  though   MODERATOR  Is there a follow up question there   QUESTION  I    well  I do have a follow up not    not directly to that question but this    how persuasive do you think a survey is going to be to the SEC  In past experience    in your past experience  to what extent have the SEC staff members taken surveys to heart   ROPER  Well  I mean    this is Barb Roper  I don t think there s    I ve made any secret of the fact that I think the problem that we re trying to solve is a problem that the SEC helped to create  At the very least  it aided and abetted the broker dealer community as they transformed themselves into advisers without being regulated as advisers   But the past is the past  and we have new leadership at the SEC that has declared its support for the fiduciary standard  We have clear authority from Congress to act    a priority of the administration to adopt new policies in this area  And one of the positive things in the situation we find ourselves in is that the    the terms of the debate have changed   We spent a lot of time  close to a quarter century in my case  arguing about what we should    how we should define solely incidental advice  You know  how the brokers should be subject to the advisers act  And this legislation offers a new way forward where we re not going    we re don t have to have that debate  The point is settled   The issue is what standard are we going to apply to all investment advice by brokers  And I think that offers    offers the SEC and opportunity to walk away from its past policy errors and to adopt a new approach   TITTSWORTH  Mark  this is David Tittsworth with the Investment Adviser Association  I certainly agree with Barb  And Barb and I and others on this call  Deni  ph   have been working on this issue for well    Barb said    years  For me  it s been    years that I ve been with this organization   In      when Arthur Levitt was chairman of the SEC  that s when they issued their first proposed rulemaking on the broker dealer exclusion under the advisers act and a number of us were involved  And that s probably why we re on this call together today   I agree with Barb  You look at the lineup of the SEC today  and it s completely different from what it was in       And I think you look at Section     of Dodd Frank it says  SEC  go out  consider public input  Tell us exactly in your report to Congress what type of input that you got   And I think this survey is the type of information that the SEC can and should consider absolutely in doing this survey  But the proof is in the pudding  and I think the    the study and the report are the first steps  We re    all of our groups here today are taking this very seriously  We hope the SEC will do the same  And I think the study is the first step  And then we go on to see whether or not they can actually put it into black letter regulation   CRAWFORD  This is Deni  ph  Crawford  The pressure is really on the SEC to do the right thing  And this study absolutely supports the right result  The time has come for the SEC to stand and deliver to Congress  It s no longer something that they can keep in house and decide   Now  they are required under Dodd Frank  a newly passed federal law  to report directly to Congress and  in effect  to the American people what the standard ought to be  what the studies show  what people believe  what the best approach is and this study is probably going to end up being the seminal study to address those issues   MODERATOR  Our next question  Operator   OPERATOR  The next question comes from Suzanne Barlyn  ph  of Dow Jones  Please go ahead   QUESTION  Hi everyone    Suzanne from Dow Jones  I am often hearing about how the advisers act standard is meant to apply to advisers and is just inconsistent with the business model of brokers  How will that be reconciled   ROPER  Yes  This is Barb Roper  First of all  the advisers act is meant to apply to investment advice  And when Congress created the exemption for broker dealers  they actually clearly intended to create a very narrow exemption that would ve applied to brokers only when they conducted the transaction based kind of business that was typical at the time   And the    the broker dealer community has made a choice over the last two decades based on  I think  realistic perception of the marketplace  that the profits lay in a more advisory business model  And the question is  you know  are they going to then have to    having chosen to remake themselves as advisers  are they going to have to meet the appropriate standards   But beyond that  the    the fiduciary duty is the exact sort of facts and circumstances based principles based standard that has the flexibility to be adapted to a variety of different circumstances  And the legislation is clear that it will not apply to all of the different things that brokers do that are not personalized investment advice to retail clients   It applies only where it s appropriate  Well  I could make the case that there are a few areas where we d like to see it as well  But it applies specifically to a certain kind of conduct that was meant to be conducted according to this standard   And so many of the arguments that you hear from the industry that we won t be able to do this  that and the other thing  they re either specifically provided for in the legislation or they re not investment advice so they re not affected   QUESTION  What did you think about the footnote by Cigna  ph  in    in their comment letters about having extra time for the industry adapt to whatever standard the SEC ultimately may impose  Do they need extra time   TITTSWORTH  Well  Suzanne  David Tittsworth with the IAA  I think that what Barb Roper says is    is absolutely right  Number one  I think we re    some of the arguments or the characterization of arguments that have been made are perhaps a little bit overblown  I think we re only talking about broker dealers who are providing investment advice   We re not talking about broker dealers effecting securities transaction which is the definition of a broker dealer under the     Act  We re talking about them making markets  We re not talking about them doing a lot of the things that broker dealers do that make them very different from investment advisers   So    and in terms of the    the timeframe  I think a lot of it ll depend on what the SEC is going to do  I think and if you read some of the other comment letters even from some other brokerage companies that have been submitted to the SEC in the past couple of weeks  it indicates that the    that a number of broker dealers are already living very well with the advisers act fiduciary duty   For example  I think the question about whether or not people    anyone who provides discretionary advice to a client is well settled  Everybody agrees that that implicates the advisers act fiduciary duty whether you call yourself an investment adviser or broker dealer or something else   The real    I think when you get down to it  what we re talking about is non discretionary advice in a commission based setting and    and that I think a lot of firms have already begun to make that transition  But  you know  I think that it s fair for the SEC to    to give all firms appropriate amounts of time to adjust to whatever rules they    they implement   GLOVSKY  Suzanne  this is Bob Glovsky  You know  in the    in the act  Congress did address the application of the standards by saying specifically that commissions were permitted and proprietary sales were permitted and that the key in applying the fiduciary standard is the appropriate disclosure and informed consent   We at the CFP Board have had a fiduciary standard and the majority of our certificants receive some of their compensation in the form of commissions and they have worked within fiduciary standard now for some time  And they ve been able to do it within their business model   So it really comes down to  as Congress said  it s    it s disclosure and informed consent   QUESTION  Thank you   MODERATOR  Operator  let s proceed to our next question   QUESTION  Good afternoon  everyone  Thanks for hosting the call   So my question comes from page    of the report  question one  titled who is investing  And when you ask respondents whether they make decisions about where their savings are placed  did you make a distinction as to whether they teamed up with a financial adviser or whether they made these decisions all on their own   HUEBER  This is Graham Hueber from Info ORC  We asked the question first of all for them to identify themselves  are you an investor  And I can read you that question  It says   Are you an investor  By an investor  do you make decisions about where your savings are placed  This could mean you own bank certificates of deposit  stocks  bonds or mutual funds either directly or through retirement plans such as     k  s  IRA s  Roth IRA s or similar plans    And then those who said yes  we asked   Do you use  and we asked them if they used an investment adviser  a stockbroker or none of these  So    percent said they use an investment adviser     percent said they use a stockbroker  And    percent said none of these   Now that does add to more than     because you could answer that you use both  So the net for using anything  either an investment adviser or a stockbroker is    percent who said yes they use one or the other  Does that answer your question   QUESTION  Yes  it does  Let me just catch up here   HUEBER  Because first we ask them what they do  do you have any of the following  And we list all the things that could qualify you as an investor  And then if you said yes to that  in the second question  we ask what do you use   QUESTION  OK   HUEBER  And    and your choices were an investment adviser or a stockbroker   QUESTION  OK  And are those    are the responses to your follow up question in that same slide or is it somewhere else   HUEBER  I think it might be on the next page   QUESTION  Page     OK   HUEBER  Let me look  If not  it s also in a document that appears at the back which is the questionnaire with every question in it and the data for each question posted   QUESTION  OK  OK  All right  And forgive me if you ve covered this already  but what will happen to these survey results  you know  after this presentation  Are you going to present them directly to the SEC or to    what s the next step  ROPER  Well  this is Barb Roper  Shortly before the start of the call  we did present the survey report and the release to the SEC  both to the record for the study     QUESTION  Right   ROPER      and to the Chairman Schapiro  And I believe it was sent as well to each of the individual commissioners   QUESTION  OK  OK  Thank you   TITTSWORTH  And Donna  ph   David Tittsworth  A number of our groups will be meeting with SEC staff and the SEC commissioners in the months ahead   QUESTION  OK  Great  Great   MODERATOR  Our next question  Operator   QUESTION  OK  Thanks  Hi  everybody  So I was wondering  given the number of surveys that have revealed similar results over the years  RAND was already referred to but there are other ones too  I m just wondering why you thought the SEC would take more notice of this one   ROPER  This is Barb Roper  There are a couple of reasons  One is that the context has changed  The SEC is specifically directed by Congress to answer this question  And this provides up to the date response to an issue that the SEC is required to address in its study   So I think  you know  it s    there s no    there is in a sense no big surprise here in terms of the results of the survey  And  you know  it s possible that without our survey the SEC would ve simply relied on the past information in the RAND study  for example  and the previous studies we ve been a part of   But Congress was aware that those studies had been conducted  directed the SEC to look at these issues  And so we took the time to update the record on what s basically a fairly fundamental question when you look at the policy decisions   If investors don t understand these differences and if they re not aware of the differences in standards  then you really do have to change the    the regulatory approach  You can t continue to have a system that s based on a difference that investors don t recognize   QUESTION  So you mentioned that was the context base so there were a couple of reasons   ROPER  Well  the one other    one other thing that is new and different in our study is  you know  in    in this current situation  the strongest opposition is coming from the insurance community  And so we specifically asked what we have not done in the past which is  does the public believe that insurance agents who sell securities should be subject to this same standard and saw the same overwhelming support  So the    you could argue that the past studies haven t really addressed that issue in terms of a group that s most vocal in its opposition  So we ve added to the record in that regard   HUEBER  This is Graham Hueber from Info ORC  Part of the value of this study is there are three questions in here that trend off of earlier studies from      and        So it helps to make the case with consistent data over a period of six years and three different studies that show that the story is the same  that the findings are the same and the required action is the same  So to have another update to a trend line is always helpful   QUESTION  I do have another question if I could ask it   MODERATOR  Please proceed   QUESTION  I m also wondering if you think the increasing likelihood that the Republicans are going to regain the House and now  you know  have this potential to win back the Senate  how this changing political picture affects the prospects for the fiduciary standards  if at all   TITTSWORTH  This is David Tittsworth with the IAA  Elizabeth  Great question    nobody knows the answer to your question  Or if they do  I hope they ll fill us all in   I think that my opinion is that whether the House or Senate or both go to the Republicans in November will not change these provisions of Dodd Frank   Yes  there s talk of repealing health care  Yes  there have been some people talking about rolling back aspects of the Dodd Frank legislation  But I would be very doubtful that Congress is going to be able    you know  a new Congress and  you know  you look at all the different permutations and possible scenarios and I can t come up with one where I ve    I think  you know  Republicans come in  take both houses by such margins that they re able to start rolling back provisions of Dodd Frank and especially provisions that were negotiated among Republicans and Democrats as you saw in the process over a period of a year and a half   There are differences of opinion on this  and I certainly was well  you know  involved in the process over the last year and a half  But I think there was a compromise  and I d be surprised to see Congress reverse itself on this one   ROPER  This is Barb Roper  I just    I d add one point to that which is when you have    percent of the survey respondents saying that they support the fiduciary duty or    percent or whatever the exact number is     percent  That suggests we didn t ask this as a political poll  but that suggests overwhelming bipartisan support   In other words  this is not inherently a partisan issue  and in fact  some of the stronger support on the commission in the past has come from Republican members  So there s nothing about the issue that is by definition political   Obviously  all policy in Washington gets made in a political context so we ll see what the future brings  But there s no reason that this ought to be affected by that   MODERATOR  Our next question  Operator   QUESTION  Hi  Thank you for holding this conference  I actually tried to withdraw my question because it was very similar to what Ms  McBride  ph  asked about  you know  what s sort of new about this study versus the RAND study or is there anything surprising in it  So and that s it   MODERATOR  I think we do have one follow up question that we have time for  We re just about at the hour mark and because of schedules we re going to need to break this off here in a moment  but let s go to that final question  Operator   QUESTION  Actually  this question may have been    been answered in that last bit there  But looking at the change of    Congress    a Republican Congress wouldn t necessarily have to overturn Dodd Frank  It could just sort of defund implementation of regulations   Is that a concern at all  sort of either holding up things or stopping them by starving the SEC of money   ROPER  This is Barb Roper  You know  I m not sure that kind of speculation is particularly useful  but in the Senate it is difficult without an overwhelming majority  as the Democrats have learned in the last couple of years  to do anything   And so it would take  you know  a huge  huge change of a kind that I don t think anyone is anticipating to give the Republicans the kind of majority if they were so inclined which I think is a big if  to start  you know  attaching riders to appropriations bills to prevent the SEC from acting   In addition  the legislation gave the SEC greater authority over its budget than it has had in the past  So it is less susceptible  arguably  to those kinds of threats than it has been in the past   But finally  as I said  you know  it s    while we are    we are very focused on this issue and believe it is of paramount importance to retail investors  They re going to have a lot bigger issues on their plate if we do see the kind of change in Congress that you re anticipating  And the idea that the fiduciary duty provision of the Dodd Frank Act would rise to that level of significance I think is unlikely  particularly when the surveys show that there is overwhelming public support   QUESTION  OK  Thank you   MODERATOR  And we are going to need to end things at that point  Actually  that s going to be the end of the question and answer period  You ve been listening to a news conference sponsored by the Consumer Federation of America  AARP  the North American Securities Administrators Association  also by the Investment

96,In reality it took the majority of buyers about five years to save enough for a per cent deposit partly due to lower interest rates and a two year drop in prices according to the bank research Millennials who successfully purchased also admitted getting into the market became easier once they made compromises just over half said they gave up on their home ideals in some way This included settling for a property that wouldn t be their forever home changing location preferences or compromising on storage space Infinity Group money mentor Graeme Holm said Millennials were often discovering simple lifestyle changes could rapidly improve their ownership prospects There s a perception that young buyers are locked out the market but once you get a budget and stick to it s a lot easier Mr Holm said We live in a society of instant gratification and even simple lifestyle changes make a difference ING head of retail banking Melanie Evans said the main challenge for home buyers was coming up with a per cent deposit but those who took a flexible approach would get ahead While many millennial Aussies believe home ownership is a far off dream our research found the reality of owning a home is far closer than they think Ms Evans said You just need to be willing to make small sacrifices in the first instance to save for that deposit and compromise on the type of home you re willing to take on to kick off your home ownership journey,"Compromise is the key MILLENIALS are discovering buying property is more achievable than they initially thought, with many buyers under the age of 40 getting into the market in half the time they expected.

97,Modern banking is clearly no place for trust Targets profits and commission are the words to which most bank managers are trained to relate But trust Forget it The case of year old Tom Brandwood who was sold a stockmarket growth product with a six year term and high charges by Lloyds TSB is probably only the tip of the iceberg There are thousands of elderly and vulnerable people being ripped off regularly by sleazy salesmen It is possible to imagine a typical sales tactic Smile talk for long enough and use lots of jargon As their eyes glaze over you can go for the kill With luck you can dip into their life savings and by the time a relative notices the deal is done Money Mail is determined to stamp out this leeching of the elderly We accept that many older people are capable of looking after their finances without outside help But even the most adept old and young can be bamboozled by high pressure sales That is why we have launched our Stop the Savings Stings campaign today to expose and bring an end to financial abuses of the elderly and vulnerable We believe every sale to an elderly or vulnerable person should be reviewed by a senior compliance manager at head office who takes personal responsibility for that sale There is a strong case for having an independent witness such as a friend relative or legal adviser present when large sums of money are involved In the end it comes down to trust Sadly the days have long gone when we can trust our local bank nOUR annual mortgage survey once again makes fascinating reading for anyone buying a home For a buyer with a Pounds mortgage on the standard variable rate there is a difference of more than Pounds a year in the interest you could pay on your home loan depending on your lender The cheapest lenders are generally the new direct banks such as Virgin Egg and Standard Life In the High Street building societies win hands down over banks and converters A borrower with the cheapest society Yorkshire would have paid Pounds less interest this year than someone with Alliance Leicester or Northern Rock The top nine cheapest lenders were building societies and the new direct banks The message of our survey is simple When you go for a mortgage don t just look at the price for the special deal Compare the standard variable rates being charged and what they would mean for your monthly repayments These are after all what you will probably be paying for most of the term of your mortgage,"TRUST. It's an ideal that's straightforward and, for many people, it is the way the world still operates.  

This particularly applies to older people who have a long-term relationship with a bank. So it is sickening when trust is betrayed.  ",0,

119,In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn globally as at the end of October The increasing use of ETPs is part of the growth in passive investing The UK pensions market has been significantly affected by regulatory reforms There are a couple of themes at the core of these reforms that are particularly relevant in the context of this article Costs and performance Transparency Liquidity We will briefly consider why exchange traded products ETPs are a relevant investment tool for trustees and advisers to consider when evaluating investment strategies with a particular emphasis on costs and performance In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn trn globally as at the end of October This represents a year compound annual growth rate of ETPs are open ended investment vehicles that generally track an underlying benchmark and are listed on an exchange ETPs are transparent instruments to the extent that index and product holdings are openly published Additionally as they are exchange traded prices are quoted intraday providing both transparent price discovery and accessibility Although liquidity and transparency are additional benefits the increasing use of ETPs is as much a reflection of the growing influence of passive investing more broadly across the asset management industry Investors are now questioning whether active managers are able to consistently outperform their benchmarks and are invariably turning to passive instruments like ETPs to provide consistent risk adjusted market returns Value for money The Pensions Regulator published its new draft DC code on th November In this report it emphasises the importance of assessing whether schemes offer value for money VFM Although there is not a prescribed definition of VFM costs and charges are highlighted as being an important consideration Fund management fees and portfolio transaction costs are referenced in particular On these two cost metrics ETPs are generally more cost efficient than actively managed funds The asset weighted expense ratio not including portfolio transaction costs for passive funds was only in compared with for active funds The above figures are particularly relevant when considering the charge controls on default arrangements in certain occupational pension schemes Lower cost passive solutions become more relevant when taking into consideration the p a cap that has recently been implemented Add lower portfolio transaction costs to this and the case for using passive instruments like ETPs to manage scheme costs begins to resonate with an increasing number of investment managers Cost however should not be considered in isolation In its guidance for DC pension schemes The Pensions Regulator states As investment returns net of charges have such a major impact on member outcomes trustees should pay particular attention in any VFM assessment to the investment return delivered to members In effect costs are a component of total investment returns therefore it is prudent for us to turn to the wider argument of how passive returns compare to actively managed funds and how ETPs can be implemented in schemes to improve risk adjusted returns Comparing active and passive investment returns The regulatory focus on costs and performance are not exclusive to DC schemes The government commissioned Hymans Robertson report looked at how the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS could be reformed The report specifically questioned whether active managers are providing consistent above benchmark returns to justify their higher overall costs Indeed it was concluded that over an extended period of time active equity returns across various geographical regions failed to outperform the benchmark and that this trend was particularly prevalent in the case of developed market equities The conclusions in this report are consistent with the findings in a recent Morningstar study that compared active and passive returns across various US equity size and style categories The research found that over a ten year period aggregate passive funds outperformed active funds across eight of the nine defined categories In light of growing evidence of active manager underperformance the value proposition that they offer is being questioned by an increasing number of investment managers Trustees assessing whether schemes are offering VFM should be aware of the potential benefits of using passive instruments like ETPs either alongside or in place of certain active funds A smarter way forward With the future in mind one area of particular growth has been in smart beta products Their goal is to provide improved risk adjusted returns either increase returns and or reduce risk and enhanced diversification over the long term The strategies implemented are non market cap weighted and deliver exposure to systematic investment factors or alternative weighting schemes Investors can now access a variety of smart beta equity and fixed income exposures allowing one to gain exposure to a risk premium in a cheaper systematic way In the new era of VFM ETPs generally and specifically smart beta exposures provide an additional tool for managers to use in member pension schemes Rima Haddad is head of UK

Don't feel alone. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 61% of U.S. workers during 2020 felt the same way.

Start the process by reviewing your goals. You might have had a savings target based on certain assumptions about how you thought your life was going to go. These assumptions may have changed. For example, you may have gotten married, added a family member, changed jobs, or moved. As goals and circumstances change, the amount you need to save to meet them may change as well.",1,

122,D C Fort Pierce A The Florida tree law is based on the common law derived from court decisions It basically provides that the when a tree located on one parcel falls onto another parcel the owner of the parcel on which the tree fell is usually responsible for the tree removal and the cost thereof So in an HOA setting if a tree on the common area falls on to an individual lot the lot owner is responsible for the tree removal and cost not the HOA Likewise if a tree located on a lot fall onto the common area the HOA is responsible for its removal and cost The only things that changes this dynamic are The tree owner knew or should have known the tree was in imminent danger of falling and did nothing to stop it This would mean the tree owner or HOA was negligent and should pay for the cost of removal A perfectly healthy tree not in danger of falling under normal conditions that falls due to a hurricane does not make the tree owner negligent No one is expected to prevent a perfectly healthy tree from falling due to a hurricane The HOA governing documents make the HOA responsible for all trees on the common areas and the individual lots Q I live in a well run POA The Board and ACC exercise common sense relating to maintenance appearance document issues and the vast majority of residents comply However one resident is resisting a reasonable request to paint his house it is long overdue for paint The owner has stated the maximum fine he can be assessed is and that if he pays it the POA cannot revisit this issue Is this correct A E Vero Beach A No this is not correct Imposing a fine is an enforcement tool intended to compel the owner to stop violating the rules or take certain action such as painting their house Paying the fine does not relieve the owner from complying with the rule Think of it this way If local code enforcement sites a property owner and imposes a fine for a code violation and the owner pays the fine but does not correct the violation the county can still enforce compliance Q One of our owners died after obtaining a reverse mortgage on his condo The company who provided the second mortgage is not paying assessments nor is it maintaining the unit including not running the air conditioner What is our recourse A different owner who wants to obtain a reverse mortgage is requesting change in the language of our documents to conform with the lender s requirements We have not changed the language and now find the reverse mortgage was denied What is our association responsibility in these reverse mortgage situations A In the first instance whoever the current owner of the property is owes assessments at least from the day they took title forward This applies to a mortgage company bank that may now own the property So you should follow your normal collection procedure in collecting the debt incurred since the title was conveyed to the present owner As for the past due assessments that may have been due when the property was conveyed to the current owner it depends on several factors Who is the current owner the bank that held the reverse mortgage or some other party What do your governing documents provide If there is a second mortgage that entity has no obligation to pay the assessments or maintain the property until such time as the title is conveyed to the second mortgage holder Regarding the air conditioning the Association if the property is deemed abandoned under the Condominium Act the Association may step in and maintain the property and charge the cost to the current owner and even lien for the costs incurred Before doing this you should consult with your association s legal counsel as there are a lot of factors to be considered Regarding your second question your Board has no obligation to seek an amendment to the current governing documents to accommodate an owner seeking a reverse mortgage However if the owners sufficiently petition the Board to call a special members meeting to approve an amendment there is a mechanism under the Condominium Act that this could occur despite the support of the Board Richard D DeBoest II Esq is co founder and shareholder of the Law firm Goede Adamczyk DeBoest Cross PLLC Visit our website www gadclaw com or to ask questions about your issues for future columns send your inquiry to question gadclaw com The information provided herein is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal advice The publication of this article does not create an attorney client relationship between the reader and Goede Adamczyk DeBoest Cross PLLC or any of our attorneys Readers should not act or refrain from acting based upon the information contained in this article without first contacting an attorney Richard D DeBoest II Guest Columnist,"Editor's note: Attorneys at Goede, Adamczyk, DeBoest & Cross, PLLC., respond to questions about Florida community association law.

126,On that same day if you had instead spent your on a mysterious virtual currency named Bitcoin you d now be sitting on a pile of money worth Since those early days the online money has multiplied in value by hundreds and thousands But it has also taken a dive too Now if you were to make the same investment you wouldn t get as much back would only buy you of a Bitcoin Some financial experts reckon the value could rise further in the next few years Even top industry names including Elon Musk have shown their support as he revealed Tesla would look at allowing the currency for transactions once sourcing it becomes cleaner and greener But some investors grow more uncertain about the future of the leading currency as the value has recently tumbled and entered worrying lows So just how do you invest in the shadowy world of Bitcoin We explain everything you need to know but first a word of warning Investing in Bitcoin is risky as the value of the cryptocurrency can go down as well as up You should only invest if you understand the dangers and have the money to lose if something does go wrong The cryptocurrency was making a huge leap in value until it had a wobble at the beginning of this year and plummeted in May This just goes to show how it can just as easily go down and lose its value What is Bitcoin Bitcoin became the world s first entirely virtual currency when it was introduced in January Users cannot carry coins or notes and its value appears only as a number on a screen It was created by an online account which went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto At the moment one Bitcoin equals or to us When and why was Bitcoin created The cryptocurrency was introduced after the Great Financial Crisis of It was made in response to the world s reliance on banks for all financial transactions Bitcoin s founder planned to create a peer to peer payment system that did not rely on third party confirmation This means banks couldn t get involved in any money exchanges How does Bitcoin work data react Each Bitcoin is a computer file stored in a virtual space like a computer or even more recently a digital wallet app on a smartphone a bit like ApplePay data react You can send Bitcoins to others and they can send Bitcoins to you and you can store them in these spaces data react Transactions are recorded in a public list called the blockchain which makes them possible to trace data react That means people won t be able to spend coins they do not own make copies or undo transactions without it flagging on the history channel What is Bitcoin mining New currency is created via a complex online process called mining which uses supercomputers to create new Bitcoins using computer code data react The sums are becoming more and more difficult to stop too many Bitcoins being generated at any one time that s why the value is so high too data react If you started mining now it could take years to get a single Bitcoin it costs a lot in electricity bills too so you could end up spending more on your tariff than the currency is worth Why is Bitcoin popular Lots of people like the idea that it is a way of exchanging currency without the need for a bank It s also efficient to use over the internet There s a transparent set of rules too which means less control from outside parties over your money This can present its own dangers as well though Is Bitcoin safe data react Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded publicly so it s hard to copy the currency illegitimately make fake ones or spend ones you don t own data react But it is quite possible to lose your online wallet or delete it by accident and not be able to recover your investments data react There have also been thefts from some websites that let you store your Bitcoins too data react If you use Bitcoin for payments you should also know the price is extremely volatile data react The value could drop significantly at any moment and you could lose a lot of money data react It s also not regulated so you don t have the same protection as other services where you might be able to take a complaint to an ombudsman How can you buy Bitcoin The most common way to buy the currency is to download a broker app such as Coinbase and Blockchain These allow users to use a credit or debit cards to exchange pounds for Bitcoin Users do not have to buy whole Bitcoins and can purchase a small percentage that matches the value of their cash investment Once a request has been made online miners will decide whether to approve the transaction If approved the money will be taken from a user s account in exchange for Bitcoin When selling users can use the same app to sell their Bitcoin in return for its cash value What can you buy with Bitcoin In its early days Bitcoin proved relatively worthless with one notorious example seeing an early pioneer paying for a pizza using two bitcoins At Bitcoin s peak however that pizza would be worth the equivalent of around There are Bitcoin restaurants you can still use the money at if that s how you wish to spend the cryptocurrency But you can also use it to buy something as big as a car or as small as a video game Elon Musk pulled the means of using the currency to buy a Tesla as the company explained how mining it was so poor for the environment You will be able to buy one of the cars with the crypto cash though once of mining is done with clean energy How can you spend Bitcoin You can only spend Bitcoin virtually and in online transactions currently It s not the same as cash and you can t use odd change from your built up bank to pay for your parking or buy lunch at your local cafe Certain websites and companies are offering use of the currency though like Microsoft But if you lose virtual access to your money you will lose all of your investment Brit James Howells famously threw out a computer containing Bitcoins on its hard drive the equivalent of a whopping today As at the time only the computer the currency was bought on could be used to redeem it the money was all but lost to Welshman Howells The broken Dell laptop is now believed to be buried below a mound of rubbish at a tip in Newport Wales The cryptocurrency market fluctuates all the time but you can check its progress with our guide But more recently the price of Dogecoin has seen a surge after Elon Musk backed moves to massively slash its

increase in order for workers not to lose ground They should have more wealth to compensate and they don t said Anthony Webb senior research economist at the Center for Retirement Research In the average to year old had accumulated wealth equal to about three times his income slightly below the level of Wealth includes all financial assets such as k balances and home equity income includes wages plus earnings and returns on financial assets This metric excludes the future value of employer pensions and Social Security There s no magic ratio to guarantee that people will meet their retirement goals Webb said Wealth to income adequacy depends on a number of factors including lifetime earnings health status and willingness to economize The Center for Retirement Research simply highlights a disturbing trend today s workers should be accumulating more than prior generations yet they aren t Today s workers should be socking away more for retirement because the decks are stacked against them in ways that they weren t years ago In percent of all private sector workers had pensions as their sole retirement plan benefit by that number had dropped to percent according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute Back in the early s double digit interest rates meant that it was possible for many retirees top live comfortably off of bond income Social Security Changes to Social Security mean that boomers will receive a lower replacement rate that is the percentage of pre retirement income that the benefits replace than current retirees And yet people are living longer than ever before so future retirees will need to stretch their nest eggs longer than prior generations What s more out of pocket health care costs are eating up an increasing share of retirees incomes at a time when fewer workers have employer sponsored retiree health care benefits to make up the difference between what Medicare covers and what they owe A recent analysis by HealthView Services a Danvers Mass based provider of health care cost data and planning tools projected that for a year old couple retiring in years at age health care costs will gobble up approximately of their lifetime Social Security benefits This sobering state of affairs won t be immediately obvious to the couple who at will likely still be in relatively good health But health care costs typically rise at around to a year and most people consume more of these increasingly pricey services as they age Meanwhile Social Security s annual inflation raise based on a broad basket of goods and services known as CPI W

Retirement Risk Index This index measures the likelihood of households to achieve the same standard of living in retirement as they had while working Their analysis found that about half of American households will be unable maintain their standard of living in retirement This will mean a series of trade offs at best and sacrifices at worst It s one thing to accept a slightly reduced standard of living say to be forced to downsize to an apartment when you d rather remain in the family home It s quite another to have to choose between keeping the lights on and buying medicine or food To be sure rosier predictions exist on Americans retirement readiness But these typically rest on rosy assumptions Studies projecting that Americans are saving enough for retirement typically assume that people will reduce their spending after their children leave home according to the Center for Retirement Research brief Under these projections parents do not spend more on themselves when their children become financially independent Instead they sensibly plow the money they used to spend on their offspring into their retirement fund Then when they retire they continue to spend less than they did when their children were at home Some retirees will surely follow this prudent pattern but plenty won t Nitty gritty By contrast the wealth to income ratio is a neutral gauge that doesn t assume a specific behavior And what it shows is troubling according to the Center for Retirement Research Harold Evensky a financial planner and professor of practice at Texas Tech University said he

Whether we choose to pay attention or not, American workersâ€™ savings shortfall is a slow-moving hurricane thatâ€™s going to hit many of us where we live.

By some measures, Americans are less prepared than ever to retire comfortably. A recent brief by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College examined workersâ€™ wealth-to-income ratios from 1983 to 2013. Tracked by the Federal Reserve, this metric plots workersâ€™ accumulated assets over their incomeâ€”the higher the ratio, the bigger their financial cushion.",1,
133,Fiduciary Regulations President elect Trump is leaning towards either watering down or eliminating the new fiduciary rule all together That would essentially reverse many if not all of the changes that employer plan sponsors and broker dealers and other retirement plan service providers have implemented or are planning to implement to comply with the fiduciary rules The new U S Department of Labor fiduciary rule which goes into effect in April expands the investment advice fiduciary definition under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of The new rule requires all investment advisers including brokerages to act as fiduciaries when making recommendations or giving advice on k plans or individual retirement accounts IRAs including in instances of a rollover or distribution Today brokers can market retirement plan services and provide investment information to plan sponsors and participants while charging a commission for their services rather than fully transparent fees In such arrangements brokers are not required to act in a fiduciary capacity a higher standard of care and independence that requires the adviser to act solely in the best interest of their client Instead they may meet the investment suitability rules which don t require that the product or service be in the best interests of the buyer investor but only that the investment recommendation is suitable Allowing brokers to provide advice without being a fiduciary as the Trump administration might do would promote an environment which may lead to higher cost plan services and potential conflicts of interest as brokers may choose to seek out the arrangements that pay them the most rather than do what s in the best interests of plan sponsors and participants The Effect of Low Interest Rates on Pension Plans Unfunded pension obligations have soared since the economic crisis triggered by interest rates that have remained at historic lows Pension plans are highly interest rate sensitive and would benefit greatly from even a moderate increase in interest rates With a pro growth low tax agenda and the potential end of Dodd Frank s regulatory limitations and a more hawkish Federal Reserve interest rates are likely to rise And that would result in broadly improved funded status for pensions The End of Dodd Frank President elect Trump has stated he intends to roll back or scrap the Dodd Frank regulations which he believes are placing a stranglehold on the ability of banks to lend and fuel economic growth Generating more growth would increase capital spending and create more jobs thus encouraging savings investment and consumer spending With more money to spend and invest employees should look to save more in their retirement plans especially in light of lessons learned from the crisis Corporations would also be looking for tax deductions and may elect to increase employer matching and profit sharing contributions Tax Reform Trump has indicated he intends to simplify the tax code and make the United States more globally competitive by having only three individual tax rate tiers reducing the top tax rate from to and reducing the corporate tax rate from to However he is also likely to reduce or eliminate many tax filer statuses and eliminate many individual and corporate tax deductions Many preferential tax items will be on the table including the pretax deduction for k contributions Congress has been considering eliminating or reducing the amounts employees can contribute to plans on a pretax basis to create a new source of revenue for the federal government While that may seem preposterous since pretax k contributions are only tax deferred until retirement Congress generally sees the deduction as too costly to the government If changed this would leave most k plans with either lower savings limits or primarily limited to Roth k contributions Those are contributed to k plans on an after tax basis although funds can be withdrawn at retirement on a tax free basis This trade off of pre tax deductions for Roth plans would provide more revenue to the federal government today But it would deprive it of revenue over the long term as retirees begin to withdraw their funds or even years from now Removing the tax deduction which is quite popular with employees and employers or reducing the contribution limits would only increase the risk that large swaths of the U S population will be unprepared for retirement when it comes Social Security Reform On Social Security Trump has been vague But he has indicated it is his intent to improve solvency without cutting benefits There are very few variables in this equation To improve Social Security solvency policymakers can either reduce monthly benefits increase contributions by increasing the FICA FUTA withholding requirement increase the age at which benefits can be claimed or a combination of those approaches In the past Republicans have proposed creating personal accounts to allow employees to save and invest some of the money they defer into the Social Security program But if these savings dollars came from the existing FICA FUTA withholding amount it would likely reduce funding of the plan for existing retirees and those workers retiring in the near future thus accelerating the solvency crisis So while personal accounts may actually have a positive long term impact on Generation Y and Z workers entering the workforce the existing trust would still be at risk if no other changes are made Another consideration is the impact of increasing FICA FUTA withholding on the economy If employees and employers are forced to contribute more to the Social Security program it would take money out of the economy and result in significant economic drag a fact which would not be lost on Trump as he tries to jump start U S growth There is however a reason that politicians have been unable or unwilling to change the system all of the policy prescriptions available are highly unpopular Small Business Open Multiple Employer Plans Congress is considering a bill to make it possible for small unrelated employers to join together in groups to offer a single retirement plan for their employees instead of offering individual plans Aggregating these employees into large groups which would effectively amount to group purchasing of k retirement services would provide improved economies of scale and lower pricing for employers and costs to employees That would also make ERISA compliance easier while increasing the ability of small employers to offer more robust and valuable retirement benefits Given that small businesses are the largest net employer in the United States this could be an important assist to our ability to save for retirement The problem the bill would solve is that these MEP arrangements aren t permitted under current law for unrelated employers Today employers either need to be related via common ownership cooperative service organizations or trade associations and meet certain other criteria in order to be considered eligible to participate in a MEP This squeezes out the average small employer and makes plan expenses higher and less attractive for both plan sponsors and participants alike Open MEPs are popular on both sides of the political aisle and a bill is likely to pass Congress in or with the signature by President Trump a high likelihood While the above isn t an exhaustive list it s a good starting point on the essentials of retirement post election In the days ahead expect more change and analysis as the implications of the election continue to unfold Rob Massa a wealth adviser is director of retirement at Ascende an EPIC Company in Atlanta,"If Trump shelves the new fiduciary rule, brokers might seek out deals that pay them best, rather than act in the best interests of sponsors and employees.

With Democrats worried about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and Republicans focused on reinvigorating their legislative and administrative agendas, national pension and retirement policy questions arenâ€™t at the forefront of Donald Trumpâ€™s first-100-days agenda. But given recent regulatory moves in retirement, such as those involving fiduciary rules, Trumpâ€™s â€œpro-growthâ€ agenda, and the current shaky foundation for the future of U.S. retirement, both he and Congress are likely to focus on some of these issuesâ€”which matter to both CFOs and rank-and-file alikeâ€”in the days ahead.",0,

prompting contentious legal disputes in the process Austin Business Journal has found no evidence that the Hardeman group has broken the law Bryan Hardeman Will s father was also in attendance though he preferred to talk about the future of the Dog s Head area of East Austin rather than his own plans Mark Riley attached to the Hardeman Group as trustee for several of the contested properties was flanked by private security as he conducted a pair of auctions Multiple observers suggested the scene was unlike anything they had ever scene at a foreclosure sale World Class is a major owner of Austin real estate rising to local and national prominence in recent years as Paul employed a buy and hold strategy But it has been hobbled since federal authorities raided its offices in August World Class has filed more than bankruptcy cases in federal court in Austin including three new cases filed May to head off other foreclosures After a chaotic day at the courthouse there were as many questions as answers But here s what we know Three foreclosure sales were conducted for World Class owned properties for the former M campus owned by Silicon Hills Campus LLC a shopping center at Burnet Rd owned by WC Teakwood Plaza LLC and vacant land along South Congress Ave in South Austin owned by WC South Congress LLC Two of the sales appeared to have been successfully completed though the threat of legal challenges hang over both However the auction for the old M campus failed because the winner failed to produce payment Learn more about the sales below World Class filed three bankruptcies to avoid foreclosure They were for WC th and Waller LLC which owns an East Austin building at Waller St WC th and Rio Grande which owns the Rio night club at Rio Grande St and WC Culebra Crossing SA LP which owns property in San Antonio The bankruptcies were all filed by Mark Ralston of Fishman Jackson Ronquillio PLLC who declined comment World Class avoided foreclosure on WC W Ben White LP which owns property off Ben White Boulevard near Menchaca Road in South Austin by obtaining financing to pay off its debt to BBVA USA The property has an assessed value of more than million Paul in emails sent after this story was initially published railed against the auctions and claimed his attempts to pay off World Class debts have been ignored More on a wild day at the courthouse By p m May tempers were flaring at the Travis County courthouse Paul shouted expletives at trustee Mark Riley and the two engaged in multiple heated exchanges throughout the afternoon including during an auction for WC South Congress LLC As Paul protested the bids slowly ticked upward million million million Riley had allowed one auction participant to bid with reserve funds but said that if the funds don t qualify by p m then we re going to start over The winning bid was for The man who submitted it declined to identify himself other than saying he was a Houston businessman He said the South Congress property could be a site for future multifamily development It was unclear if the p m deadline was met but the sale did not restart World Class had attempted to resolve its debts in the bankruptcy case of WC South Congress LLC before that auction but a judge denied the motion because it did not propose paying post petition interest and costs to the secured lender the Hardeman group s Soco LP World Class said in bankruptcy filings it had secured million in new financing from an entity called South Congress Lender LLC According to the Texas Comptroller s office the LLC was registered April by Jules Caplin who declined to comment Controversy also swirled around the acre former M campus owned by World Class Silicon Hills Campus LLC which has been tied up in litigation since World Class defaulted on a million loan for the property in August That was the same month M moved out to new digs in Northeast Austin and the property has been vacant ever since With roughly million square feet of space the campus is among the largest and most prominent properties owned by World Class The firm has been fighting foreclosure for about months On May Travis Funding LLC submitted a winning bid of million for the campus and the auction concluded at p m But the buyer failed to materialize with the funds by a p m deadline Angela Zavala substitute trustee for the property attempted another auction but did not complete it by a p m deadline The sale has been voided The original people did not get here at p m with their checks Zavala said at the courthouse according to a video provided to Austin Business Journal by an associate of Paul The auction did go past p m which we cannot do Travis Funding LLC had been in a bidding war with Silicon Hills Campus lender ATX Debt Fund which topped out with a credit and cash bid of million In the bankruptcy case of Silicon Hills Campus World Class similarly attempted but lost an attempt to stop the auction in court World Class claimed in court filings that it had obtained million in debtor in possession financing from Travis Funding LLC That would have been enough to pay off ATX Debt Fund s entire claim estimated to be in excess of million We offered to pay it in full Paul said May at the courthouse adding that he put up a total of million in bankruptcy court in the days before the foreclosure sales with the hope of clearing all of his debts Travis Funding LLC was incorporated in Delaware on May according to public records In a May letter submitted in bankruptcy court the entity agreed to place the million in escrow to accrue at a fixed rate of Attorney James Billingsley who represented ATX Debt Fund at the sale said if the winning million bid went through it would have resulted in his clients being paid in full and we ll have no further involvement Asked if there would be relief in that outcome after being tied up in the case since the fall of Billingsley quipped If I make my flight back to Dallas there will be In the end it appears the fight over Silicon Hills Campus will continue If a resolution is not reached before next month s slate of foreclosure sales either by resolving the debt or through legal action the campus will likely be back on the auction block June The original lender for Silicon Hills Campus LLC was Ladder Capital Finance LLC Then in January ATX Debt Fund bought the million note according to Travis County records It is not clear who is behind ATX Debt Fund Another foreclosure sale was held May for WC Teakwood Plaza which owns property at Burnet Road in North Austin Though the sale was scheduled to be conducted between a m and p m it didn t conclude until after p m drawing the ire of Paul However Riley contended that the sale was permissible because he had announced it at a m It s unclear what might become of that dispute The auction initially appeared to be won by Monte James with a bid of million But James said after the auction there was a higher opening credit bid by the lender of million The Hardeman group s Burnet LP is the lender for WC Teakwood Plaza In a May email Paul suggested Riley ignored his million bid for the property during the auction though video provided by Paul was inconclusive as to whether the bid came in on time Paul also claimed that both Riley and Bryan Hardeman refused to accept full payment including post petition interest and legal fees for World Class debts on both WC Teakwood Plaza LLC and WC South Congress LLC ahead of the auctions I asked Mark Riley what is the total amount due before the auction and it was a higher number than we ve ever seen because they probably added other fees and expenses and in spite of that I tendered the payment in full Paul said in the email They refused to accept and proceeded to do the auction The WC Teakwood Plaza property is tied to a million loan from April and the notice of foreclosure was filed April That was the same day a federal bankruptcy judge granted a motion for relief from stay which effectively allowed Burnet LP to sell the property In addition to the foreclosures here are some additional details about the Chapter

Year Years Years Years Class P Shares Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund Portfolio Turnover The Fund pays transaction costs when it buys and sells securities or instruments i e turns over its portfolio A high rate of portfolio turnover may result in increased transaction costs including brokerage commissions which must be borne by the Fund and its shareholders and is also likely to result in higher short term capital gains for taxable shareholders These costs are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the expense example above but are reflected in the Fund s performance The Fund s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended October was of the average value of its portfolio Principal Investment Strategies The Fund generally seeks to achieve its investment objective by allocating its assets among multiple investment managers Underlying Managers who are unaffiliated with the Investment Adviser and who employ one or more non traditional and alternative investment strategies including but not limited to Equity Long Short Dynamic Equity Event Driven and Credit Relative Value Tactical Trading and Opportunistic Fixed Income Strategies each of which is described below The Fund will primarily invest in a portfolio of i equity securities including common and preferred stocks convertible securities rights and warrants depositary receipts real estate investment trusts REITs pooled investment vehicles including other investment companies exchange traded funds ETFs European registered investment funds UCITS and private investment funds and partnership interests including master limited partnerships MLPs ii fixed income and or floating rate securities including debt issued by corporations debt issued by governments including the U S and foreign governments their agencies instrumentalities sponsored entities and political subdivisions covered bonds notes debentures debt participations convertible bonds non investment grade securities commonly known as junk bonds bank loans including senior secured loans and other direct indebtedness iii mortgage backed and other mortgage related securities asset backed securities municipal securities to be announced TBA securities and custodial receipts iv currencies and v unregistered securities including for example restricted securities eligible for resale pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of as amended Securities Act The Fund s investments may be publicly traded or privately issued or negotiated The Fund may invest without restriction as to issuer capitalization country currency maturity or credit rating The Fund s investments may include securities of U S and foreign issuers including securities of issuers in emerging countries and securities denominated in a currency other than the U S dollar Up to of the Fund s net assets may be invested in illiquid investments The Fund does not have a target duration The Fund may invest in stock warrants and other securities of special purpose acquisition companies SPACs including for purposes of effectuating the Event Driven and Relative Value strategies that are described below A SPAC is typically a publicly traded company that raises funds through an initial public offering IPO for the purpose of acquiring or merging with another company to be identified subsequent to the SPAC s IPO The Fund will also invest in derivatives for both hedging and non hedging purposes although no Underlying Manager is required to hedge any of the Fund s positions or to use derivatives The Fund s derivative investments may include i futures contracts including futures based on equity or fixed income securities and or equity or fixed income indices interest rate futures currency futures and swap futures ii swaps including equity currency interest rate total return variance and credit default swaps and swaps on futures contracts iii options including long and short positions in call options and put options on indices individual securities or currencies swaptions and options on futures contracts iv forward contracts including forwards based on equity or fixed income securities and or equity or fixed income indices currency forwards interest rate forwards swap forwards and non deliverable forwards and v other instruments including structured securities exchange traded notes and contracts for differences CFDs As a result of the Fund s use of derivatives the Fund may also hold significant amounts of U S Treasuries or short term investments including money market funds repurchase agreements cash and time deposits The Fund may use leverage e g through borrowing and or the use of derivatives As a result the sum of the Fund s investment exposures may significantly exceed the amount of assets invested in the Fund although these exposures may vary over time The Fund may take long and or short positions in a wide range of asset classes including equities fixed income commodities and currencies among others Long positions benefit from an increase in the price of the underlying instrument or asset class while short positions benefit from a decrease in that price The Fund may implement short positions through short sales of any instrument including ETFs that the Fund may purchase for investment or by using options swaps futures forwards and other derivatives For example the Fund may enter into a futures contract pursuant to which it agrees to sell an asset that it does not currently own at a specified price and time in the future This gives the Fund a short position with respect to that asset The Fund intends to gain exposure to the commodities markets primarily by investing in five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Fund each organized as a company under the laws of the Cayman Islands together the MMA Subsidiaries The MMA Subsidiaries are advised by the Investment Adviser and subadvised by one or more Underlying Managers The Fund may also gain exposure to the commodities markets through investments in other investment companies ETFs or other pooled investment vehicles The Fund may invest up to of its total assets in aggregate in the MMA Subsidiaries The MMA Subsidiaries primarily obtain their commodity exposure by investing in commodity linked derivative instruments including but not limited to commodity futures commodity options and commodity linked swaps Commodity futures contracts are standardized exchange traded contracts that provide for the sale or purchase of or economic exposure to the price of a commodity or a specified basket of commodities at a future time An option on commodities gives the purchaser the right and the writer of the option the obligation to assume a position in a commodity or a specified basket of commodities at a specified exercise price within a specified period of time Commodity linked swaps are derivative instruments whereby the cash flows agreed upon between counterparties are dependent upon the price of the underlying commodity or commodity index over the life of the swap The value of commodity linked derivatives will rise and fall in response to changes in the underlying commodity or commodity index Commodity linked derivatives expose the MMA Subsidiaries and the Fund economically to movements in commodity prices Such instruments may be leveraged so that small changes in the underlying commodity prices would result in disproportionate changes in the value of the swaps Neither the Fund nor the MMA Subsidiaries invest directly in physical commodities The Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund MMA Subsidiaries also invest in other instruments including fixed income securities either as investments or to serve as margin or collateral for its swap positions and foreign currency transactions including forward contracts From time to time the Investment Adviser may for short or longer term periods select a transition manager to transition a portion of Fund assets from one Underlying Manager to another or at the direction of the Investment Adviser to implement a sub strategy with an objective of providing investment results that seek to correspond before fees and expenses to the performance of a specified index The Investment Adviser or an Underlying Manager on behalf of the Fund may obtain passive exposure to a particular sub asset class from time to time by making an index based investment e g in an ETF Management Process The Investment Adviser and the Fund have received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Under the exemptive order the Investment Adviser has the ultimate responsibility subject to oversight by the Fund s Board of Trustees to oversee the Underlying Managers and recommend their hiring termination and replacement The initial shareholder of the Fund approved the Fund s operation in this manner and reliance by the Fund on this exemptive order The Investment Adviser determines the percentage of the Fund s portfolio allocated to each Underlying Manager in order to seek to achieve the Fund s investment objective The Investment Adviser s Alternative Investments Manager Selection AIMS Group is responsible for making recommendations with respect to hiring terminating or replacing the Fund s Underlying Managers as well as the Fund s asset allocations With respect to the Fund the AIMS Group applies a multifaceted process with respect to manager due diligence portfolio construction and risk management The Investment Adviser may determine to allocate the Fund s assets to Underlying Managers employing all or a subset of the nontraditional and alternative strategies described below at any one time and may change those allocations from time to time in its sole discretion and without prior notice to shareholders In the future the Investment Adviser may also determine to allocate the Fund s assets to Underlying Managers employing other strategies not described herein The descriptions of the investment strategies below are subjective are not complete descriptions of any strategy and may differ from classifications made by other investment advisers that implement similar investment strategies The Investment Adviser s determination of the strategy shall govern Equity Long Short Strategies generally involve long and short investing based on fundamental evaluations research and various analytical measurements in equity and equity related investments Equity Long Short managers may for example buy stocks that they expect to outperform or that they believe to be undervalued and may also sell short stocks that they believe will underperform or that they believe to be overvalued Within this framework Equity Long Short managers may exhibit a range of styles including longer term buy and hold investing and or shorter term trading styles The portion of the Fund s assets invested in equity long short strategies may cumulatively represent a net short or net long position though are typically net long Dynamic Equity Strategies generally involve investing in equity instruments often with a long term view Dynamic Equity Strategies are long biased strategies and may have low excess return correlations to traditional long only equity strategies Dynamic Equity Strategies are less likely to track a benchmark than traditional long only strategies Dynamic Equity managers are less constrained than traditional long only managers with respect to factors such as position concentration sector and country weights style and market capitalization Dynamic Equity managers may hedge long positions and may also purchase in addition to equity investments bonds options preferred securities and convertible securities among others Event Driven and Credit Strategies seek to achieve gains from market movements in security prices caused by specific corporate events or changes in perceived relative value These strategies may include among others Merger Arbitrage Distressed Credit Opportunistic Credit and Value With a Catalyst investing styles Merger Arbitrage investing involves long and or short investments in securities affected by a corporate merger or acquisition Distressed Credit investing typically involves the purchase of securities or other financial instruments usually bonds or bank loans of companies that are in or are about to enter bankruptcy or financial distress Opportunistic Credit investing generally involves investing across the capital structure which could include investing in both mezzanine debt and convertible securities of an issuer and or adjusting exposures across fixed income and floating rate market segments based on perceived opportunity and current market conditions This can be done by taking a long position in a credit security or other financial instrument that is believed to be underpriced or a short position in a credit security or other financial instrument that is believed to be overpriced Value With a Catalyst investing involves taking a view on the likelihood and potential stock price outcome of corporate events such as divestitures spin offs material litigation changes in management or large share buybacks Relative Value Strategies seek to identify and benefit from price discrepancies between related assets assets that share a common financial factor such as interest rates an issuer or an index Relative Value opportunities generally rely on arbitrage the simultaneous purchase and sale of related assets that may exist between two issuers or within the capital structure of a single issuer Relative Value Strategies attempt to exploit a source of return with low correlation to the market Relative Value Strategies include among others fixed income arbitrage convertible arbitrage volatility arbitrage statistical arbitrage and equity market neutral strategies Tactical Trading Strategies seek to produce total return by long and short investing across global fixed income currency equity and commodity markets Tactical Trading managers may employ various investment styles of which the two major strategies are global macro and managed futures Tactical Trading managers that employ a global macro style may select their investments based upon fundamental and or technical analysis Tactical Trading managers that employ a managed futures style may use quantitative modeling techniques for example determining an asset s value based upon an analysis of price history price momentum and the asset s value relative to that of other assets among other factors Tactical Trading managers typically have no structural bias to be long short or neutral but at any given time may have significant long or short exposures in a particular market or asset class Along with other markets Tactical Trading Managers may invest in commodity related instruments including but not limited to commodity futures and commodity exchange traded funds Commodity markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand relationships weather governmental agricultural commercial and trade programs and policies designed to influence commodity prices world political and economic events and changes in interest rates Opportunistic Fixed Income Strategies seek to deliver positive absolute returns in excess of cash investments regardless of economic cycle i e downturns and upswings or cyclical credit availability Opportunistic Fixed Income managers seek to maintain diversified exposure across various fixed income and floating rate market Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund segments with a focus on more liquid markets assessing the relative value across sectors and adjusting portfolio weightings based on opportunity Opportunistic Fixed Income managers generally employ a bottom up credit analysis approach and a value aspect in selecting investments utilizing long and short investments as well as some notional leverage Opportunistic Fixed Income managers may seek exposure to potential income generators including among others global emerging markets investment grade and high yield debt markets convertible bonds and bank loans Additional Information The Fund s primary benchmark index is the ICE BofAML Three Month U S Treasury Bill Index Principal Risks of the Fund Loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund The investment program of the Fund is speculative entails substantial risks and includes alternative investment techniques not employed by traditional mutual funds The Fund should not be relied upon as a complete investment program The Fund s investment techniques if they do not perform as designed may increase the volatility of performance and the risk of investment loss including the loss of the entire amount that is invested and there can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved Moreover certain investment techniques which the Fund may employ in its investment program can substantially increase the adverse impact to which the Fund s investments may be subject There is no assurance that the investment processes of the Fund will be successful that the techniques utilized therein will be implemented successfully or that they are adequate for their intended uses or that the discretionary element of the investment processes of the Fund will be exercised in a manner that is successful or that is not adverse to the Fund An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC or any government agency Investors should carefully consider these risks before investing The Fund s principal risks are presented below in alphabetical order and not in the order of importance or potential exposure Absence of Regulation Risk The Fund engages in over the counter OTC transactions which trade in a dealer network rather than on an exchange In general there is less governmental regulation and supervision of transactions in the OTC markets than of transactions entered into on organized exchanges Call Prepayment Risk An issuer could exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by the Fund such as a mortgage backed security earlier than expected This may happen when there is a decline in interest rates when credit spreads change or when an issuer s credit quality improves Under these circumstances the Fund may be unable to recoup all of its initial investment and will also suffer from having to reinvest in lower yielding securities Commodity Sector Risk Exposure to the commodities markets may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in more traditional securities The value of commodity linked investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments The prices of energy industrial metals precious metals agriculture and livestock sector commodities may fluctuate widely due to factors such as changes in value supply and demand and governmental regulatory policies The commodity linked investments in which the MMA Subsidiaries may invest may involve counterparties in the financial services sector and events affecting the financial services sector may cause the MMA Subsidiaries and therefore the Fund s share value to fluctuate Counterparty Risk Many of the protections afforded to cleared transactions such as the security afforded by transacting through a clearing house might not be available in connection with OTC transactions Therefore in those instances in which the Fund enters into uncleared OTC transactions the Fund will be subject to the risk that its direct counterparty will not perform its obligations under the transactions and that the Fund will sustain losses Because the Fund s Underlying Managers may trade with counterparties prime brokers clearing brokers or futures commission merchants FCMs on terms that are different than those on which the Investment Adviser would trade and because each Underlying Manager applies its own risk analysis in evaluating potential counterparties for the Fund the Fund may be subject to greater counterparty risk than if it were managed directly by the Investment Adviser Credit Default Risk An issuer or guarantor of fixed income securities or instruments held by the Fund which may have low credit ratings may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal or default on any other obligation Additionally the credit quality of securities may deteriorate rapidly which may impair the Fund s liquidity and cause significant deterioration in net asset value NAV These risks are more pronounced in connection with the Fund s investments in non investment grade fixed income securities Derivatives Risk The Fund s use of options forwards futures swaps structured securities and other derivative instruments may result in losses These instruments which may pose risks in addition to and greater than those associated with investing directly in securities currencies or other instruments may be illiquid or less liquid volatile difficult to price and leveraged so that small changes in the value of the underlying instruments may produce disproportionate losses to the Fund Certain derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments Expenses Risk By investing in pooled investment vehicles including private investment funds investment companies ETFs UCITS and money market funds partnerships and REITs indirectly through the Fund the investor will incur not only a proportionate share of the expenses of the other pooled investment vehicles partnerships and REITs held by the Fund including operating costs and investment management fees but also the expenses of the Fund The Fund s multi manager approach may also result in additional expenses Extension Risk An issuer could exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by the Fund such as a mortgage backed security later than expected This may happen when there is a rise in interest rates Under these circumstances the value of the obligation will decrease and the Fund will also suffer from the inability to reinvest in higher yielding securities Foreign and Emerging Countries Risk Foreign securities may be subject to risk of loss because of more or less foreign government regulation less public information less stringent investor protections less stringent accounting corporate governance financial reporting and disclosure standards and less economic political and social stability in the countries in which the Fund invests The imposition of sanctions exchange controls including repatriation restrictions confiscations Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund trade restrictions including tariffs and other government restrictions by the United States and other governments or from problems in share registration settlement or custody may also result in losses The type and severity of sanctions and other similar measures including counter sanctions and other retaliatory actions that may be imposed could vary broadly in scope and their impact is impossible to predict For example the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures could among other things cause a decline in the value and or liquidity of securities issued by the sanctioned country or companies located in or economically tied to the sanctioned country and increase market volatility and disruption in the sanctioned country and throughout the world Sanctions and other similar measures could limit or prevent the Fund from buying and selling securities in the sanctioned country and other markets significantly delay or prevent the settlement of securities transactions and significantly impact the Fund s liquidity and performance Foreign risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time These risks may be more pronounced in connection with the Fund s investments in securities of issuers located in or otherwise economically tied to emerging countries Geographic Risk If the Fund focuses its investments in issuers located in a particular country or geographic region it will subject the Fund to a greater extent than if investments were less focused to the risks of volatile economic cycles and or conditions and developments that may be particular to that country or region such as adverse securities markets adverse exchange rates adverse social political regulatory economic business environmental or other developments or natural disasters High Portfolio Turnover Risk Some or all of the strategies utilized by the Fund may involve frequent and active trading and have a high portfolio turnover rate which may increase the Fund s transaction costs may adversely affect the Fund s performance and or may generate a greater amount of short term capital gain distributions to shareholders than if the Fund had a low portfolio turnover rate Active trading in derivatives will have the same effects but will not always be reflected in the Fund s portfolio turnover rate Index Risk To the extent that an index tracking strategy is used with respect to a portion of the Fund s assets including through investment in an ETF that seeks to track an index or implementation of a sub strategy by a transition manager the Fund will be negatively affected by general declines in the securities and asset classes represented in the relevant index There is no guarantee that the Fund or relevant portion of the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the relevant index Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund s ability or the ability of an ETF in which it invests to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order for the relevant portion of the Fund to track the relevant index In addition because that portion of the Fund is not actively managed unless a specific security is removed from the relevant index the Fund or an ETF in which it invests generally would not sell a security because the security s issuer was in financial trouble At times when an index tracking strategy is used with respect to a portion of the Fund s assets the Fund s performance could be lower than funds that may actively shift all of their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or to lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers Interest Rate Risk When interest rates increase fixed income securiti,,0,
s or instruments held by the Fund will generally decline in value  Long term fixed income securities or instruments will normally have  more price volatility because of this risk than short term fixed income securities or instruments  The risks associated with changing interest rates may have unpredictable effects on the markets and the Fund s investments  Fluctuations in interest rates may also affect the liquidity of fixed income securities and instruments held by the Fund   Investment Style Risk  Different investment styles  e g    growth    value  or  quantitative   tend to shift in and out of favor depending upon market and economic conditions and investor sentiment  The Fund employs various non traditional and alternative investment styles  and may outperform or underperform other funds that invest in similar asset classes but employ different investment styles   Large Shareholder Transactions Risk  The Fund may experience adverse effects when certain large shareholders purchase or redeem large amounts of shares of the Fund  Such large shareholder redemptions  which may occur rapidly or unexpectedly  may cause the Fund to sell portfolio securities at times when it would not otherwise do so  which may negatively impact the Fund s NAV and liquidity  Similarly  large Fund share purchases may adversely affect the Fund s performance to the extent that the Fund is delayed in investing new cash or otherwise maintains a larger cash position than it ordinarily would  These transactions may also accelerate the realization of taxable income to shareholders if such sales of investments resulted in gains  and may also increase transaction costs  In addition  a large redemption could result in the Fund s current expenses being allocated over a smaller asset base  leading to an increase in the Fund s expense ratio   Leverage Risk  Borrowing and the use of derivatives may result in leverage and may make the Fund more volatile  When the Fund uses leverage the sum of the Fund s investment exposures may significantly exceed the amount of assets invested in the Fund  although these exposures may vary over time  The use of leverage may cause the Fund to liquidate portfolio positions to satisfy its obligations or to meet asset segregation requirements when it may not be advantageous to do so  The use of leverage by the Fund can substantially increase the adverse impact to which the Fund s investment portfolio may be subject   Liquidity Risk  The Fund may make investments that are illiquid or that may become less liquid in response to market developments or adverse investor perceptions  Illiquid investments may be more difficult to value  Liquidity risk may also refer to the risk that the Fund will not be able to pay redemption proceeds within the allowable time period because of unusual market conditions  an unusually high volume of redemption requests or other reasons  To meet redemption requests  the Fund may be forced to sell securities  at an unfavorable time and or under unfavorable conditions  Liquidity risk may be the result of  among other things  the reduced number and capacity of traditional market participants to make a market in fixed income securities or the lack of an active market  The potential for liquidity risk may be magnified by a rising interest rate environment or other circumstances where investor redemptions from fixed income funds may be higher than normal  potentially causing increased supply in the market due to selling activity  These risks may be more pronounced in connection with the Fund s investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries   Loan Related Investments Risk  In addition to risks generally associated with debt investments  e g   interest rate risk and default risk   loan related investments such as loan participations and assignments are subject to other risks  Although a loan obligation may be fully collateralized at the time of acquisition  the collateral may decline in value  be or become illiquid or less liquid  or lose all or substantially all of its value subsequent to investment  Many loan investments are subject to legal or contractual restrictions on resale and certain loan investments may be or become illiquid or less liquid and    Summary Prospectus   Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund  more difficult to value  particularly in the event of a downgrade of the loan or the borrower  There is less readily available  reliable information about most loan investments than is the case for many other types of securities  Substantial increases in interest rates may cause an increase in loan obligation defaults  With respect to loan participations  the Fund not always have direct recourse against a borrower if the borrower fails to pay scheduled principal and or interest  may be subject to greater delays  expenses and risks than if the Fund had purchased a direct obligation of the borrower  and may be regarded as the creditor of the agent lender or counterparty  rather than the borrower   subjecting the Fund to the creditworthiness of that lender as well  Investors in loans  such as the Fund  may not be entitled to rely on the anti fraud protections of the federal securities laws  although they may be entitled to certain contractual remedies   The market for loan obligations may be subject to irregular trading activity  wide bid ask spreads and extended trade settlement periods  Because transactions in many loans are subject to extended trade settlement periods  the Fund may not receive the proceeds from the sale of a loan for a period after the sale  As a result  sale proceeds related to the sale of loans may not be available to make additional investments or to meet the Fund s redemption obligations for a period after the sale of the loans  and  as a result  the Fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions  such as borrowing from its credit facility  if necessary to raise cash to meet its obligations  During periods of heightened redemption activity or distressed market conditions  the Fund may seek to obtain expedited trade settlement  which will generally incur additional costs  although expedited trade settlement will not always be available    Senior loans hold the most senior position in the capital structure of a business entity  and are typically secured with specific collateral  but are nevertheless usually rated below investment grade  Because second lien loans are subordinated or unsecured and thus lower in priority of payment to senior loans  they are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and property securing the loan or debt  if any  may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments after giving effect to the senior secured obligations of the borrower  Second lien loans generally have greater price volatility than senior loans and may be less liquid  Generally  loans have the benefit of restrictive covenants that limit the ability of the borrower to further encumber its assets or impose other obligations  To the extent a loan does not have certain covenants  or has less restrictive covenants   an investment in the loan will be particularly sensitive to the risks associated with loan investments   Management and Model Risk  A strategy implemented by an Underlying Manager may fail to produce the intended results  Certain Underlying Managers may attempt to execute strategies for the Fund using proprietary quantitative models  Investments selected using these models may perform differently than expected as a result of the factors used in the models  the weight placed on each factor  changes from the factors  historical trends  and technical issues in the construction and implementation of the models  including  for example  data problems and or software issues   There is no guarantee that an Underlying Manager s use of quantitative models will result in effective investment decisions for the Fund  An Underlying Manager may occasionally make changes to the selection or weight of individual securities  currencies or markets in the Fund  as a result of changes to a quantitative model  the method of applying that model  or the judgment of the Underlying Manager  Commonality of holdings across quantitative money managers may amplify losses   Market Risk  The value of the securities in which the Fund invests may go up or down in response to the prospects of individual companies  particular sectors or governments and or general economic conditions throughout the world due to increasingly interconnected global  economies and financial markets  Events such as war  acts of terrorism  social unrest  natural disasters  the spread of infectious illness or other public health threats could also significantly impact the Fund and its investments   Mid Cap and Small Cap Risk  Investments in mid capitalization and small capitalization companies involve greater risks than those associated with larger  more established companies  These securities may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements and may lack sufficient market liquidity  and these issuers often face greater business risks   Mortgage Backed and Other Asset Backed Securities Risk Mortgage related and other asset backed securities are subject to certain additional risks  including  extension risk   i e   in periods of rising interest rates  issuers may pay principal later than expected  and  prepayment risk   i e   in periods of declining interest rates  issuers may pay principal more quickly than expected  causing Fund to reinvest proceeds at lower prevailing interest rates   Mortgage backed securities offered by non governmental issuers are subject to other risks as well  including failures of private insurers to meet their obligations and unexpectedly high rates of default on the mortgages backing the securities  Other asset backed securities are subject to risks similar to those associated with mortgage backed securities  as well as risks associated with the nature and servicing of the assets backing the securities  Asset backed securities may not have the benefit of a security interest in collateral comparable to that of mortgage assets  resulting in additional credit risk   Multi Manager Approach Risk  The Fund s performance depends on the ability of the Investment Adviser in selecting  overseeing  and allocating Fund assets to the Underlying Managers  The Underlying Managers  investment styles may not always be complementary  Underlying Managers make investment decisions independently of one another  and may make decisions that conflict with each other  For example  it is possible that an Underlying Manager may purchase an investment for the Fund at the same time that another Underlying Manager sells the same investment  resulting in higher expenses without accomplishing any net investment result  or that several Underlying Managers purchase the same investment at the same time  without aggregating their transactions  resulting in higher expenses  Moreover  the Fund s multi manager approach may result in the Fund investing a significant percentage of its assets in certain types of investments  which could be beneficial or detrimental to the Fund s performance depending on the performance of those investments and the overall market environment  The Fund s Underlying Managers may underperform the market generally or underperform other investment managers that could have been selected for the Fund   Some Underlying Managers have little experience managing registered investment companies which  unlike the private investment funds these Underlying Managers have been managing  are subject to daily inflows and outflows of investor cash and are subject to certain legal and tax related restrictions on their investments and operations  The Investment Adviser and the Fund have received an exemptive order from the SEC that permits the Investment Adviser to engage additional Underlying Managers  to enter into subadvisory agreements with those Underlying Managers  and to materially amend any existing subadvisory agreement with Underlying Managers  upon the approval of the Board of Trustees and without shareholder approval   NAV Risk  The NAV of the Fund and the value of your investment will fluctuate   Non Hedging Foreign Currency Trading Risk  The Fund may engage in forward foreign currency transactions for hedging and non hedging purposes  An Underlying Manager may purchase or sell foreign    Summary Prospectus   Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund  currencies through the use of forward contracts based on the Underlying Manager s judgment regarding the direction of the market for a particular foreign currency or currencies  In pursuing this strategy  the Underlying Manager seeks to profit from anticipated movements in currency rates by establishing  long  and or  short  positions in forward contracts on various foreign currencies  Foreign exchange rates can be extremely volatile and a variance in the degree of volatility of the market or in the direction of the market from the Underlying Manager s expectations may produce significant losses to the Fund  Some of these transactions may also be subject to interest rate risk   Non Investment Grade Fixed Income Securities Risk  Non investment grade fixed income securities and unrated securities of comparable credit quality  commonly known as  junk bonds   are considered speculative and are subject to the increased risk of an issuer s inability to meet principal and interest payment obligations  These securities may be subject to greater price volatility due to such factors as specific issuer developments  interest rate sensitivity  negative perceptions of the junk bond markets generally and less liquidity   Short Position Risk  The Fund may enter into a short position through a futures contract  an option or swap agreement or through short sales of any instrument that the Fund may purchase for investment  Taking short positions involves leverage of the Fund s assets and presents various risks  If the value of the underlying instrument or market in which the Fund has taken a short position increases  then the Fund will incur a loss equal to the increase in value from the time that the short position was entered into plus any related interest payments or other fees  Taking short positions involves the risk that losses may be disproportionate  may exceed the amount invested and may be unlimited  To the extent that the Fund uses the proceeds it receives from a short position to take additional long positions  the risks associated with the short position  including leverage risks  may be heightened  because doing so increases the exposure of the Fund to the markets and therefore could magnify changes to the Fund s NAV   Sovereign Default Risk  An issuer of non U S  sovereign debt  or the governmental authorities that control the repayment of the debt  may be unable or unwilling to repay the principal or interest when due  This may result from political or social factors  the general economic environment of a country  levels of foreign debt or foreign currency exchange rates   Special Purpose Acquisition Companies Risk  The Fund may invest in stock  warrants and other securities of SPACs  SPACs are in essence blank check companies without operating history or ongoing business other than seeking acquisitions in a predetermined time frame  typically       months   The value of a SPAC s securities is particularly dependent on the ability of its management to identify and complete a profitable acquisition  The values of investments in SPACs may be highly volatile and these investments may also have little or no liquidity  An attractive acquisition or merger target may not be identified at all  in which case the SPAC will be required to return any remaining monies to shareholders  and the Fund may be subject to opportunity costs to the extent that alternative investments would have produced higher returns   Stock Risk  Stock prices have historically risen and fallen in periodic cycles  U S  and foreign stock markets have experienced periods of substantial price volatility in the past and may do so again in the future   Subsidiary Risk  The MMA Subsidiaries are not registered under the Investment Company Act and will not be subject to all the investor protections of the Investment Company Act  Changes in the laws of the United States and or the Cayman Islands could result in the inability of the Fund and or the MMA Subsidiaries to operate as described in the Prospectus and the SAI and could adversely affect the Fund   Swaps Risk  In a standard  swap  transaction  two parties agree to exchange the returns  differentials in rates of return or some other amount earned or realized on the  notional amount  of predetermined investments or instruments  which may be adjusted for an interest factor  Swaps can involve greater risks than direct investment in securities  because swaps may be leveraged and subject to counterparty risk  e g   the risk of a counterparty s defaulting on the obligation or bankruptcy   credit risk and pricing risk  i e   swaps may be difficult to value   Swaps may also be considered illiquid  It may not be possible for the Fund or the MMA Subsidiaries to liquidate a swap position at an advantageous time or price  which may result in significant losses   Tax Risk  The Fund will seek to gain exposure to the commodity markets primarily through investments in the MMA Subsidiaries  Historically  the Internal Revenue Service   IRS   issued private letter rulings in which the IRS specifically concluded that income and gains from investments in commodity index linked structured notes  the  Notes Rulings   or a wholly owned foreign subsidiary that invests in commodity linked instruments are  qualifying income  for purposes of compliance with Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of       as amended  the  Code    However  the Fund has not received such a private letter ruling  and is not able to rely on private letter rulings issued to other taxpayers  The IRS issued a revenue procedure  which states that the IRS will not in the future issue private letter rulings that would require a determination of whether an asset  such as a commodity index linked note  is a  security  under the Investment Company Act  In connection with issuing such revenue procedure  the IRS has revoked the Note Rulings on a prospective basis  In light of the revocation of the Note Rulings  the Fund intends to limit its investments in commodity index linked structured notes   Applicable Treasury regulations treat the Fund s income inclusion with respect to a subsidiary as qualifying income either if  i  there is a distribution out of the earnings and profits of a subsidiary that are attributable to such income inclusion or  ii  such inclusion is derived with respect to the Fund s business of investing in stock  securities  or currencies   In reliance on an opinion of counsel  the Fund may gain exposure to the commodity markets through investments in the MMA Subsidiaries   The tax treatment of the Fund s investments in the MMA Subsidiaries may be adversely affected by future legislation  court decisions  Treasury Regulations and or guidance issued by the IRS  which may be retroactive  that could affect whether income derived from such investments is  qualifying income  under Subchapter M of Code  or otherwise affect the character  timing and or amount of the Fund s taxable income or any gains and distributions made by the Fund  If the IRS were to successfully assert that the Fund s income from such investments was not  qualifying income   the Fund may fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  RIC  under Subchapter M of the Code if over     of its gross income was derived from these investments  If the Fund failed to qualify as a RIC  it would be subject to federal and state income tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates with no deduction for any distributions paid to shareholders  which would significantly adversely affect the returns to  and could cause substantial losses for  Fund shareholders   U S  Government Securities Risk  The U S  government may not provide financial support to U S  government agencies  instrumentalities or sponsored enterprises if it is not obligated to do so by law  U S  Government securities issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association   Fannie Mae    Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation   Freddie Mac   and Federal Home Loan Banks  are neither issued nor guaranteed by the U S  Treasury and  therefore  are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States  The maximum potential    Summary Prospectus   Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund  liability of the issuers of some U S  Government securities held by the Fund may greatly exceed their current resources  including any legal right to support from the U S  Treasury  It is possible that issuers of U S  Government securities will not have the funds to meet their payment obligations in the future   Underlying Manager Risk  Underlying Managers may employ a derivation of their privately offered hedge fund strategies  with notable key differences  as these vehicles are not registered under the Investment Company Act and  therefore  are subject to fewer regulatory restraints than the Fund  These restrictions include  but are not limited to  factors such as leverage  concentration and liquidity  The risk return profile of the strategies employed for the Fund may differ from the Underlying Manager s other strategies  In addition  an Underlying Manager may trade less complex instruments for the Fund or may trade at differing frequencies or times for the Fund  The Fund may be disadvantaged by buying or selling investments at later times than the same investments are bought or sold for the Underlying Manager s other funds or accounts  subject to applicable law and the Underlying Manager s policies and procedures   As a result of the foregoing

144,Many not for profit health systems are currently engaged in or considering strategic actions such as a merger acquisition operating agreement or joint venture notes Michael Ancell senior consultant and national segment leader for health care investments at Mercer in St Louis Missouri He explains to PLANADVISER that during such actions organizations prioritize projects and the number one priority is patient care and getting operations configured Because of this organizations often put off decisions about consolidation of retirement plans However strategic actions among not for profit health care organizations have been going on for years and many are now facing retirement plan issues Ancell says An organization may end up with multiple defined contribution plans and needs to consolidate and bring best practices into plan governance design and investment lineup According to Ancell Mercer is seeing more requests for proposals RFPs as health systems turn to this project and need help He adds that part of due diligence before completing mergers and acquisitions is to understand defined benefit plan assumptions used by each entity to calculate future benefit payments One issue unique to not for profit health care organizations is that some may be classified as church plans not subject to Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA or Pension Protection Act PPA requirements These plans have more flexibility in the assumptions they can use for benefit calculations as well as funding schedules Some health care organizations want to maintain that status and the flexibility it provides for those plans so consolidating defined benefit plans can be tricky In general Mercer says some strategic actions may materially alter an organization s balance sheet and boards may be unwilling to tolerate a significant asset decline post action Finance and investment committees should consider how best to integrate investment strategy and whether these factors may necessitate a change in investment risk profile Managing endowment assets is important because those assets can be used to fund pension benefits Ancell notes If organizations have a defined benefit plan they fund it with operations revenue but if they don t make enough they will have to pull money out of endowments The combination of organizations and their corresponding committees warrants revisiting key investment policy questions such as time horizon risk tolerance and return objectives for the new combined entity Mercer has prepared a survey designed to facilitate this process For those organizations looking to de risk defined benefit plans Mercer suggests developing a strategy for getting the plan fully funded Ancell points out that interest rates keep dropping and if an organization has developed an end game and puts the plan on a de risking glide path lower interest rates will make funded status worse Another issue unique to not for profit health care entities is the organizational and cost related changes brought on by Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA requirements Some organizations are not as financially healthy as before Ancell says and they may need to look again at the endowment and pension plan risks they can take But Mercer says that in some not for profit health care organizations have seen modest improvement in volumes and operating conditions Improved operations may have increased their risk tolerance For defined contribution plans organizations that have gone through a merger or acquisition should be aware of the differences between plans and will eventually will need to harmonize the plans so certain employees are not getting a better or worse benefit than others Ancell says He adds that retirement plan consolidation should not be taken lightly or quickly Organizations should take this opportunity to review plan design and the long term vision for their plans how they are incentivizing employees to participate in the plans and how they helping plan participants achieve retirement readiness Tackle the entire project with a long term view of what you want the plan to be for your organization and the outcomes you want for participants he suggests According to Ancell Mercer recommends that not for profit health care organizations adopt a formal investment policy statement make a clear committee assignment for defined contribution plans and develop a charter for the committee members outlining their responsibilities Mercer suggests organizations clearly define defined contribution plan governance and consider whether this is an HR function or finance investment committee responsibility It notes that recent regulatory attention has focused on defined contribution plan fees and is likely to expand to other areas Boards may wish to reconsider which area of an organization is best equipped to ensure regulatory compliance and recognize that ultimate fiduciary duty resides within the organization not its plan recordkeeper Other investment steps for not for profit health care organizations recommended by Mercer include Set a risk floor for the system Most not for profit health systems are subject to debt covenants that may restrict the amount of investment risk they can take with their investment portfolios Institutions should quantify their risk floor and address it in the investment policy Assess the governance structure of investment portfolios and whether a delegated solution offers potential time and cost savings Transformation in the delivery of care coupled with existing operating pressures require health care organizations to reduce costs while increasing the quality of care Delegating certain elements of an organization s investment function can potentially reduce investment expenses and free up staff and committee time to focus on strategy Review the fixed income allocation and evaluate whether unconstrained bond funds could be a component of a fixed income program Health care operating portfolios have generally been structured more conservatively than traditional endowment portfolios with larger allocations to fixed income Operating revenue shortfalls may increase reliance on operating portfolio returns however historically low fixed income yields present a challenge In addition to ensuring that overall allocations are appropriate to support an operating portfolio s multiple objectives organizations should determine if the size and composition of fixed income holdings remain appropriate and understand their sensitivity to a rising rate environment The fixed income portfolio could even be viewed as a partial hedge to variable rate debt on the balance sheet Set an illiquidity budget as part of managing the overall risk profile Some systems are increasing their allocations to private or illiquid assets Yet rating agencies may count illiquid assets in days cash on hand calculations The investment committee should determine how illiquid investments are viewed by all constituencies and set an illiquidity budget as part of the overall risk profile,"Mergers and acquisitions among health care organizations continue to affect not-for-profit health care organizations and their retirement plan investing decisions.

Consulting firm Mercer has released a list of ten investment priorities for not-for-profit health care organizations.",0,
145,The investment is my pension and retirement plan at work And the company I work for pays for everything What an easy way to save Although savings are made up of many different components retirement programs represent a large part says a September study by the Employment Benefit Research Institute in Washington D C No kidding In employer pensions paid U S retirees more than billion in benefits almost percent more than the billion they received from Social Security Thousands in benefits As a rule the longer you work at a place the higher your pension benefits Job hoppers may be losing thousands of dollars in pension benefits It is something that should be taken into account when moving around said Richard Hinz of the U S Department of Labor s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration There are two main types of pension plans defined benefit and defined contribution Defined benefit plans pay you a set amount usually based on years of service and average salary in my case my average salary during the last five years In a defined contribution plan the company employee or both contribute so much the payout depends on how well the money is invested At my company I have the best of both worlds a defined benefit plan that lets me accumulate years of service through and a defined contribution plan that began three years ago in which the company kicks in about percent of my salary each year to a tax deferred account That s in addition to a k plan in which the company matches part of the money I put in If I had quit three years ago my defined benefit plan would have entitled me to receive a month at age If I left today I would receive a month based on three more years of service and a higher average salary Assuming I could make percent on my money I would have needed about three years ago and today to get that kind of income at age And even if I never get another raise my benefit would go up to a month if I work until I am the equivalent of having in cash and making percent a year Meanwhile the defined contribution account is already worth close to I could take the money if I left today Growing benefits But why leave The incentive to stay is big The defined contribution account based on just a percent annual rate of return will grow to more than if I hang on until I am It is very important to take a look at the entire compensation package rather than only the salary Hinz said The value of many parts of the compensation package may not be readily apparent nor is the potential loss of accumulated benefits But there is a loss U S Department of Labor figures show the average worker who switches jobs loses more than percent of his defined benefit pension Generally there is no loss in benefits in a defined contribution plan If the employee is fully vested he can take the money in a lump sum and roll it over to a tax deferred plan But only about percent of workers who receive unplanned lump sum distributions roll over the entire amount and just an additional percent roll over part of it Most people just spend the money Hinz said It is a loss in the sense that it is no longer available for retirement And in most cases there is a percent tax penalty if you are under years of age Of course employees are becoming a lot more aware of retirement health and other benefits now that downsizing has cut an estimated million people from corporate payrolls since I know tons of people who through no fault of their own are leaving their jobs I don t know anyone who is leaving voluntarily said Cindy Hounsell staff attorney for the Pension Rights Center in Washington D C a non profit advocacy group The bottom line Workers should be aware of what their pension benefits are and consider them before switching jobs People that have jobs should appreciate them and know what they have Hounsell said Humberto Cruz welcomes questions and comments from readers Although he cannot respond to each one individually he will answer those of general interest in his column Write to Savings Game c o Press Telegram Pine Ave Long Beach Calif,"It has to be my best invest ment by far.

163,Intrigued we visited the property to explore the benefits of outdoor heating When we arrived we found no radiator in the garden but could not help but notice that the house did have possibly the largest conservatory I had ever seen in the UK attached to a house measuring about foot by foot There was no mention of this on the particulars The estate agent s details had failed to mention this spectacular mini Crystal Palace The bemused seller explained he had reported both errors to his estate agent when he put the property up for sale nine months previously but the agents were still sending out the wrong details despite repeated complaints Convinced this was a rare case we asked another agent to measure up our house for sale A spotty year old duly arrived and began pointing his brand new infra red measuring device gadget around the rooms I was not in the house at the time but my wife tells me it was like being on the set of Star Wars As he moved around the house he informed my wife of the measurements She insisted that some sounded a bit odd but he ploughed on until he got to our own conservatory and mis measured it by more than feet As it had just been built she showed him the builder s own plans listing the correct measurements but he insisted he was right and would not be convinced otherwise Needless to say when the draft details turned up nearly every measurement was wrong and the manager apologised profusely for his Saturday boy and came round to do the job again When recounting these tales I am reminded yet again why home information packs a glorified estate agent s particulars will not work and what a thoroughly daft idea they are I am still staggered the government is blundering on with them despite overwhelming evidence they will not work The main problem is that like the estate agent details I was sent no one will trust them and they will be almost worthless They may save a few lazy estate agents a trip to your home and add hundreds of pounds to the cost of selling your property but no buyer will believe them They will want to carry out their own thorough checks and surveys Caveat Emptor will always be the dominant factor in property buying and the government will learn the hard way that it is making a big mistake in insisting sellers produce a pack that will be little more than a fancy estate agents report There are many more problems with Hips We are still waiting for the full rules to be published even though they are just a couple of months away The training of assessors is in a mess and even estate agents doubt their value The shame is that mortgage lenders and trade bodies did not lobby harder to torpedo this foolish idea Perhaps because the cost will fall mostly on the seller and a new industry will be created many thought not to bother This is a big mistake because one thing Hips will do is cause problems in the property market by slowing down the sales process particularly in fast moving property markets such as London The process of compiling a Hip could take weeks Just as lenders are striving to speed up the mortgage offer process the government has put the brakes on the whole business It is enough to make you want to put a radiator in the garden just for the hell of it The bigger the loan the better The latest buzz in the mortgage market is per cent and over loan to value Alliance Leicester Birmingham Midshires Northern Rock and others are queuing up to offer loans of up to per cent LTV You may think I am opposed to this Strangely I am not These loans have been around for a long time years or more although they have been restricted in the past to selected members of high earning professions whose salaries were expected to climb steadily giving them the ability to afford it Their wider availability is not an issue the regulators should be concerned about except if and it is a big if they are sold to the wrong people such as debt addicts who will almost certainly default on them Interestingly these products are mostly being sold through intermediaries who are perhaps best placed to explain the benefits and the dangers In essence per cent is an arbitrary figure in any event and lending more than the value of a property has always been possible for borrowers Historically lenders have leant towards keeping LTVs down to reduce their risks something particularly important during times of house price recession when a property could be falling in value and a repossessed property may be worth less than the price it was bought at Now lenders see property prices as only moving upwards Whether this is correct only time will tell It is certainly a risky strategy but probably not a disastrous one In reality the real risk with LTVs over per cent falls on the lender If they cannot recover their debt they will face the problems not the borrowers who may walk away from a loan they cannot afford albeit to face the prospect of being chased for many years for the outstanding debt Most borrowers particularly first time buyers want to enhance and invest in their property and these super size loans will help them do this As long as they can afford the repayments the borrowing costs are likely to be far more reasonable with a per cent LTV mortgage than with a credit card or a personal loan In many ways high LTVs can benefit borrowers by keeping borrowing costs down Whatever their faults in comparison with other types of debt mortgages remain relatively cheap Holding on to hand me downs Will we one day see the days of a property owning population Mrs Thatcher s dream consigned to the dustbin of history I am prompted to ask this after Alliance Leicester s prediction that the buy to let market will grow by up to per cent in the next years In London To Let signs are now almost as numerous as For Sale signs particularly near good schools Anecdotal evidence suggests many homemovers are now trying to hold on to their previous home as a buy to let rather than sell it It suggests that in years to come the notion of selling your home may well be seen in the same way as giving away the family silver Kevin O Donnell is a freelance

178,Preferred Shares have not performed very well over the past few years so I don t want those What often comes next is a question similar to If I don t want to put money into those do you have anything else you might recommend As it turns out we do have a lot that we would recommend and it generally comes under the category of alternative investments which are not publicly traded on markets Most of the investments that we have in this area have been providing steady returns in the six percent to per cent range annually over the past several years Before you think that these are some strange and extreme types of investments it is worth noting that according to Benefits Canada almost per cent of Canadian pension plans are now invested in alternative investments The plan managers are doing this for all of the reasons raised in the opening three quotes They are worried about volatility and risk adjusted returns from stocks They are especially concerned that in a low interest rate world the plans can t generate the required returns with only traditional conservative government or high quality corporate bonds While alternative investments include infrastructure commodities and private equity much of our investment focus is in the areas of private debt and real estate In a nutshell private debt is lending that is not done by traditional banks and does not include bonds traded on public markets Ever since the banking landscape has changed and their lending strategy narrowed This left many companies and individuals who required debt to look for alternative sources of funds Over the past decade private debt has grown over four fold and is now close to US trillion in assets globally according to the alternative credit council Our real estate investments meanwhile tend to be focused on managers that lend to developers and building owners and who have a global reach To help understand the increase in interest in alternative investments and why the returns are higher than most publicly traded bonds here are some examples of how private debt works In some cases the borrowers can be higher risk than traditional banks are comfortable with but often the borrowers fall into a variety of buckets that banks can t or won t service for other reasons Examples include a business that requires a loan to close an acquisition The business may be a perfect candidate for a loan but requires the funds in three weeks while a traditional bank may take three to six months to approve it Eventually the company may shift its borrowing to a bank at lower rates but in the short term the company is fine paying a high interest rate for the benefit of having the financing completed quickly In other cases a company may be in an industry that a bank may not lend to for reputational reasons but which might otherwise be a great candidate for lending For personal borrowers sometimes they are business owners with a lot of assets and good credit but low personal taxable income A bank may not give them a mortgage but a mortgage investment corporation may think they are a great loan candidate especially if they are only lending them per cent of the value of their house and the house is the first collateral on the loan In all of these cases the borrowing rates would be higher and often could be anywhere from six per cent to per cent depending on the situation It is these borrowing rates along with strong risk management practices and full collateral that can provide steady returns at rates much higher than public bonds These represent just a few examples of the many situations where someone is willing to borrow at high rates for the ability to get the lending that they require The benefits to the investor are significant First they provide investment diversification and very low connection or correlation to the stock market Second over the past five years many funds were not around prior to this returns have been quite steady with very low downside volatility Having said that a full investment cycle of to years would probably provide a little better test And third returns are often relatively high with many funds providing returns in the six per cent to percent range The main negative to private debt investments is that they are not very liquid While publicly traded securities are often easily sold daily many private debt investments might require anywhere from days to a full year to redeem This is one of the main reasons why private debt might only be one component of an overall portfolio Because the risks on lending are often only as strong as the operational skill of the manager and the security against the loan it is important to be able to assess whether any particular manager has top level skills to minimize the risk of losses While every person is different in the investing world we often have per cent to per cent of a clients overall portfolio invested in a diversified mix of private debt and other alternative investments If your portfolio is per cent invested in publicly traded investments it is worth noting that many wealthy individuals and most pension plans believe that you are making a mistake Now may be the time to consider looking beyond traditional investments to meet your longterm goals Financial Post Ted Rechtshaffen MBA CFP CIM is president and wealth adviser at TriDelta Financial He is hosting a webinar with Canadian industry leaders on Alternative Investments later this month For more information visit www tridelta ca,"I hear a lot of the following these days: ""The

185,Yet the incentive structures in the law work at cross purposes with this goal and could well undermine its success It will all come down to costs Four out of five people under age will face higher premiums than without the Affordable Care Act even with the subsidies many can receive The law requires young people to pay more for their health coverage so older people can pay less A study published this year by the American Academy of Actuaries Contingencies magazine found that because of this provision premiums for younger healthier individuals could increase by more than percent Young men will pay even more than young women A former director of the Congressional Budget Office Douglas Holtz Eakin conducted a survey that showed fewer than half of young people will sign up for insurance if premiums rise by percent Young people also face a daunting approval process in applying for coverage Applicants must divulge their income family status and information about their employers details on any insurance offered at work and their health habits just to find out if they are eligible for subsidies Ezekiel Emanuel a key architect of the president s health plan says he is worried that young people will be bewildered and they may forgo purchasing health insurance and opt to pay a penalty instead That certainly will be an attractive option for many since the penalty starts at just the first year And there is yet another disincentive for young people to enroll in coverage they can wait to sign up for coverage until after they get sick or injured The law requires health insurance companies to sell insurance to anyone who applies But if young people don t sign up the insurance pools are likely to be composed primarily of people who have high health costs This could cause a death spiral where many more older and sicker people are enrolled causing health insurance premiums to rise to cover their medical costs thereby driving even more young people out of the market The White House believes that it will be able to persuade young people who overwhelmingly supported the president to enroll out of loyalty The president connects with young people too so he needs to use that bond and get out there to convince them to sign up for health insurance to help this central part of his legacy according to Emanuel a health care expert at the University of Pennsylvania But when it comes down to paying thousands of dollars for health insurance that they may not want or need that zeal may be severely tested Consider for example a year old person earning about a year He currently could buy health insurance for about a month However the new rules and more generous benefits required under the health law mean he would have to pay about a month instead He could get a subsidy of about a month but even with that he still would be paying nearly a year more for health insurance than without the law The White House is expected to mount a massive advertising campaign this summer to encourage people to enroll This will severely test his young supporters who are having the hardest time finding jobs in our economy Forcing them to also purchase health insurance and pay more for it may cool their enthusiasm to help the president fulfill his legacy Grace Marie Turner is president and founder of the Galen Institute which is funded in part by the pharmaceutical and medical industries McClatchy Tribune News Service,"ALEXANDRIA, Va. - Virtually all Americans will be required to have health insurance under the Affordable Care Act starting in 2014, and President Obama especially wants young, healthy people to sign up.

187,Selling investments and moving to cash when stocks are predicted to drop If you follow the financial news on cable TV or the internet you re eventually bound to discover some experts who are predicting imminent huge drops in the stock market And on rare occasions they may be right but often they re not And if you were to sell some of your stocks or stock based investments based on a prediction and move the money to cash or a cash equivalent you could miss out on possible future growth opportunities if the predictor was wrong And the investments you sold still could have played a valuable part in your portfolio balance Selling underperforming assets in favor of strong performers As an investor it can be tempting to unload an investment for one of those hot ones you read about that may have topped one list or another Yet there s no guarantee that investment will stay on top the next year or even perform particularly well Conversely your own underperformers of today could be next year s leaders Waiting for today s risk or uncertainty to disappear before investing Investing always involves risk and uncertainty Instead of waiting for the perfect time to invest you re better off building a portfolio based on your goals risk tolerance and time horizon All these mistakes are examples of a risky investment strategy trying to time the market If you try to be a market timer not only will you end up questioning your buy sell decisions but you also might lose sight of why you bought certain investments in the first place Specifically you might own stocks or mutual funds because they are appropriate for your portfolio and your risk tolerance and they can help you make progress toward your long term financial goals And these attributes don t automatically disappear when the value of these stocks or funds has dropped so you could end up selling investments that could still be doing you some good many years into the future While trying to time the market is a difficult investment strategy even for the professionals it doesn t mean you can never take advantage of falling prices In fact you can use periodic dips in the market to buy quality assets at more attractive prices Suppose for example that you invested the same amount of money every month into the same investments One month your money could buy more shares when the price of the investment is down meaning you re automatically a savvy enough investor to take advantage of price drops While your money will buy fewer shares when the price of the investment is up your overall investment holdings will benefit from the increase in price Buying low and selling high sounds like a thrilling way to invest But in the long run you re better off by following a consistent investment strategy and taking a long term perspective It s time in the market rather than timing the market that helps keep portfolio returns moving in the right direction over time This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor,"You may have heard that timing is everything.

I am interested in buying a flat above a shop but have been told it would
have to be a cash purchase because the property is on a floating freehold.
What does this mean? Jane Harrison at mortgage broker London & Country says:
Floating freehold probably refers just to the flat. Normally, a flat like
this would be leasehold and covered by insurance and maintenance agreements
that included the rest of the building. Agents sometimes refer to flying
freeholds. This means part of the property is built above land that is not
part of the freehold, such as a bedroom built above a shared passageway.



Either way, lenders are not keen to provide mortgages because of the risk
from actions by the downstairs freeholder. To find a mortgage, your best bet
is to shop around, particularly among local lenders who may be more willing
to help. Remember, mortgage problems may make it difficult to resell the
property later.

193,GINNY ANDERSEN Labour Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important bill for Nelson and for the Waimea Plains I was lucky enough to be one of the members who travelled to Richmond to hear submissions for one full day from the community in terms of those that were going to directly benefit from this scheme and also those who were opposed So I m thankful for that opportunity and for those of the community who took their time to come forward and give their views On the day it was interesting to hear the background of this piece of legislation and the fact that there have been low water flows for some time in that river catchment which is well known as being the fruit bowl of one of the main areas of Nelson and it s sustained through those aquifers many agricultural industries over decades and decades within Zealand It is those aquifers that are we are advised under threat as a result of water depletion and that provides a threat not just to residential households having a security of supply of fresh water but also a lot of those agricultural businesses which people rely upon for jobs and much of the community relies upon strongly over a long period of time So this bill enables the construction of a dam that would enable that water to be built up and to replenish those aquifers In fact million cubic meters of reservoir are located behind the dam and that can be in fact released in a controlled manner during periods of high water demand and of low and natural river flows It s intended to be able to I guess replenish the Waimea Plains over that time It has been noted already today that the expert advice we received indicated that this was beneficial for the long term of that security of fresh water supply in that area In the transfer of land it s interesting to note and my colleague Stuart Nash has already mentioned that there is an impact on iwi that still requires final confirmation So the iwi affected within Te Tau Ihu are Ng ti K ata Ng ti Apa ki te R T Ng ti Kuia Rangit ne o Wairau Ng ti Toa Rangatira Ng ti R rua Ng ti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu and Te tiawa o Te Waka a M ui Those eight iwi need to have full written consent provided back to the Government to make sure that when you transfer land as this piece of legislation provides to do from Crown ownership which has a right of first refusal that that can be triggered So that land is being transferred to the Tasman District Council and the right of first refusal will be transferred along with it to local government So we need to be reassured that those eight iwi are comfortable with that transfer and that that does not provide any side issues or any other concerns around Treaty rights in that space It was really interesting to sit in in Richmond during that day and hear the full range of submissions and I would like to say that it was a pretty charged up day There were some pretty fired up people there and the Hon Dr Nick Smith s nodding because he actually took a few difficult people who were not so happy with the bill on that day so I was surprised he was smiling still at the end of the day But there was some pretty rigorous opposition to the construction of the dam in that area So the main argument made in support of this bill was the fact that it sustained the strong agricultural base that has been operating within this area for a long period of time and that that would be addressing critical water shortages That was seen by submitters as the best solution to provide security over the next one hundred years and more in that area The economic cost to the region of not proceeding with this scheme was also highlighted by a range of submitters and the concern that many of those businesses orchards apples would not be able to continue to thrive without that security of water supply Also a clear point that was made was ensuring that the needs of stakeholders and improving water quality would be reassured that by having the dam in place and replenishing those aquifers it would ensure that there was a high quality of water Another point made by I think Fish Game if I remember correctly was that while this legislation provides to transfer conservation land the Crown land it is a relatively small land and of limited conservation value One of the changes that was recommended and has been carried out is to ensure that there is access to the public That was raised by submitters on that day and we ve made sure that all possible actions are taken to ensure public access to that land It was interesting to hear from farmers who had been third and fourth generations who had continued to make a living on that land and to hear their concerns that they wanted to make sure that their businesses would continue to thrive in the future There were views from those who had businesses that there was adequate consultation carried out by the Tasman District Council but that funnily enough was the main protest point of those who did not want this bill to proceed There were deep concerns that the consultation process undertaken by the Tasman District Council was insufficient and submissions in fact raised concerns about that consultation process There was very strong opposition to the fact that people did not want this dam to proceed and I acknowledge those who took the time and were really passionate about this for the area not wanting to see it proceed A key component of that concern of not wanting the dam to proceed was opposition to the financial impact of the dam So submitters note that in recent years the estimated cost of building has surged from million to million and they are concerned that that will be borne by ratepayers who won t directly benefit from the construction of this dam In the words of some it was seen that those farmers on the land were benefiting from the ratepayers contribution to a dam that they would not see a direct benefit from The Waimea scheme is for the benefit of urban and commercial water supply and will have economic and environmental benefits for the local community particularly within the Tasman District Council but also in the Nelson City Council as well We take the view that if the Tasman District Council wishes to proceed with this and this is a local issue which has been voted on it is for the local community to determine the best way forward So the Waimea scheme has been controversial that s well noted and I saw that up close and personal on the day especially as to that cost But Labour s position has been that the future of the scheme is in local hands with it being over to the Tasman District Council and other local interests to decide whether the scheme proceeds or not This has been resolved by the Tasman District Council vote and I note that two votes were taken on August councillors voted by a narrow margin to abandon the project about the ballooning price but on September councillors voted in favour for the dam to proceed in light of the new funding model that had been reached after working with investors So the Government s financial support for the scheme is subject to normal contractual conditions being met and to financial close as has already been noted being reached by December and details need to be reached to work through this So it will be interesting to see whether we can continue to get all the paperwork completed in time and the final requirements for this bill to be done in the final members day of this sitting session So without further ado I wish all of the people in Tasman and the Nelson area all the best for the future with this exciting proposition I think it holds great promise for jobs for industry and for those that have farmed the land for a long time I commend this bill to the House,Tasman District Council (Waimea Water Augmentation Scheme) Bill - Second Reading,0,

harness the power of compound interest Even the most average of Joes can use it to make money Trust me This is so much easier than the theory of relativity Here s the gist When you save or invest your

money to roll in Start young When you re in your twenties and thirties your best friend is TIME Start rolling your snowball at the top of the hill and you ll have a much bigger mass at the bottom than someone who started halfway down Consider this Amy a year old college graduate saves per month into an account earning per year for six years That s the average annual return of the stock market over time Then at age she starts a family and decides to stay home with the children full time By then Amy had kicked in of her own money But even if she doesn t contribute another cent ever her money would grow to a million bucks by the time she turned Compare that to Jason who put off saving until he was He s still young enough that becoming a millionaire is within reach but it will be tougher Jason would have to contribute the same a month for the next years to earn million by age Although Amy invested less money out of pocket over six years vs Jason s over years her money had more time to

as your money earns more interest it ll earn even more interest You certainly won t get rich overnight this way But you will get rich if you start young invest wisely and leave it alone A final note If you invest or save in a regular taxable account Uncle Sam will want his share So make sure you factor that into your saving goal However you can invest in tax sheltered accounts and keep more of

magic,"Compound interest has been called the eighth wonder of the world. And with good reason. It magically turns a little bit of money, invested wisely, into a whole lot of cash. Even Albert Einstein -- a bit of a smarty pants -- is said to have called it one of the greatest mathematical concepts of our time.

195,Car repair shops routinely attract a high level of complaints at state and federal offices related to overcharging and gotcha methods Read this guide to find out ways to avoid getting overcharged by your mechanic Auto mechanics may work on commission or at an hourly rate which may incentivize them to perform unnecessary repairs that can turn oil changes into bills Plus repair shops have the advantage of using the safety tactic in their sales pitch as in Well you don t have to change your brake pads but they are below I would to be safe Consumer Reports chief mechanic John Ibbotson puts it this way High scare equals high profit It s hard to give anti gotcha advice in the face of safety warnings I have no intention of suggesting that you do anything to make you or your family less safe But it is possible to do that and avoid ripoffs It s Not The Nickels Dimes It s The Dollars You ll probably end up overpaying for a repair at some point in the life of your car That s not the end of the world What s important is to not get routinely ripped off and discover that you ve spent or more year after year on repairs that may not be essential AAA reports the average driver pays per year on maintenance and repairs which of course can vary based on the age of the car But if you are spending more than that ask yourself why And remember the nice service manager at your repair shop is in the sales business If your oil changes routinely end up costing you may want to consider breaking up with the shop The Medium Bills Are What Will Get You Transmissions fail and engines give up the ghost It happens Major repair bills often have as much to do with bad luck as anything else so I m not going to dwell on them This repair tech at Edmunds com revealed that shops often don t make that much money on big expensive and complex jobs Where the real financial win comes into play for them are on the medium sized jobs that are easy and can be done quickly They make money on brake jobs engine flushes and so on Keep that in mind for your next visit to the mechanic and you ll likely have more confidence as a consumer giving you an advantage Service advisors are wary of customers who look like they know what they re doing the shop worker told Edmonds com Just Say No Repair shops may tell you your bill is about to balloon and get your permission usually with some friendly language like You should really get this taken care of now But do you really need that transmission flush There s a big difference between dealer recommended service and manufacturer recommended service A good rule of thumb is to follow the later which you can find in service manuals and on carmaker websites Diagnostic Fees One of the most popular and lucrative gotchas at repair shops is the dreaded diagnostic fee a service charge for establishing the problem with your vehicle Sometimes it genuinely takes an hour or two to diagnose a repair problem But Kristin Brocoff of CarMD com said that it is also possible for techs to plug into the car s computer and get a diagnosis in seconds It takes less than two minutes for the service writer or tech to use a scan tool on your car Brocoff said If the problem ends up being something simple like a loose gas cap most shops waive or discount the diagnostic fee but some charge upwards of Ask a lot of questions and know what tests they re running on your car If you want to run a test yourself and compare your results to what a service tech is telling you you can purchase a OBD reader that can read the car s computer diagnostic codes It s important to note that the codes they generate don t always tell the whole story and they can be misinterpreted Brake for Second Opinions Car brake repairs range from simple and cheap brake pad replacement to the really expensive rotor and even caliper replacement It s easy for shops to say you need the expensive work when you could get away with the cheaper job They might even show you what looks like a terribly dirty worn rotor But rotors can be repaired turned instead of replaced for example If a shop tells you that you need a full brake replacement go to another shop and get a second opinion The variety of quotes you ll receive for repairs like this can be eye opening Last time I replaced my tires I was told I needed worth of repairs on my front brakes A month later they were fixed elsewhere for Smell Listen Look Feel This leads to perhaps the most important piece of gotcha fighting advice You have a relationship with your car Treat it like a friend and it ll do the same for you Listen to it look at it smell it feel it Listen to the sounds it makes Hear a sound like an airplane landing when you press on the brakes Take it in before a cheap repair becomes and expensive repair See a puddle stain in your parking spot Get help Smell something unusual when you turn it off Open the hood and look around Feel a drop in performance when you accelerate on a highway Notice a drop in gas mileage Take it in The most important way to avoid overpaying is to avoid the captive consumer situation A good rule of thumb You want to drive to a repair shop not get towed there Avoid letting things go until the situation is dire and it s not really possible to get second opinion quotes Question Line Items When Popular Mechanics interviewed an anonymous repair tech a few years ago he shared that many shops add annoying tack on fees like shop supplies That means you might be getting charged for a shop rag Feel free to ask and challenge the shop on these charges Doing so is fair and can put the shop on notice that you aren t a pushover Use Online Tools for a Reality Check Finally there are plenty of clever tools now that can give you a rough idea of what repairs should cost in your area Consumer Reports has one So does RepairPal com They won t be exact but you ll have a good idea if the quote you are getting is fair Also keep in mind that if the quote is too low ask questions to help make sure your shop isn t planning a bait and switch Even if you do avoid a car repair gotcha it s important to have an emergency fund so a pricey repair doesn t turn into unwanted debt Having outstanding or large debts can hurt your credit score and you ll want a strong score in the event that your car is damaged beyond repair and you need to get a new one Having a good credit

202,We re not saying it s going to be pretty Michael Carter of Gabriel Roeder Smith Co told the board He declined to be more specific In February the board and its old actuarial firm predicted Houston could make generous improvements to its nonpolice nonfirefighter pension benefits and not pay more than percent of its payroll each year to keep the pension fully funded The estimate has steadily risen to percent of payroll or about million extra next year from taxpayers rising later to million extra per year That s partly because thousands of city workers have switched from a less lucrative noncontributory pension plan to a contributory plan that provides significantly higher benefits When the pension improvements were pending before the Legislature in the percent prediction assumed that no workers would switch plans In a subsequent estimate the actuary duly noted that many employees had switched plans in the previous year helping drive up the shortfall but never predicted that employees would continue to switch The workers have switched by the thousands And District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal has confirmed that he is investigating whether the lack of the forward looking assumption was purposeful and possibly criminal since it helped cause the city to agree to benefit changes that enriched some members of the pension board and their executive director along with other city employees The subject is complex but so is the May election Voters are being asked by Mayor Bill White to approve Proposition which excuses Houston from a new state law that bars cities from reducing pension benefits already earned by employees The law would still allow cities to reduce pension benefits not yet earned That has prompted employee groups to charge that White by wanting to excuse Houston from the law must want to reduce benefits for those who are nearing retirement or have already retired White counters that he must have flexibility to negotiate changes to the plan that might not be possible because of a poorly worded state law City workers are not comforted by his trust me assertions said Fred Holmes board chairman of the Houston Municipal Employees Pension System The city s main pension fund has two major plans one in which employees contribute nothing and one in which they contribute percent of their paychecks Before the changes a year employee in the noncontributory plan would have gotten a percent pension After the changes it rose only slightly to percent In contrast before the changes in the contributory plan a year employee would have gotten percent of salary reflecting the value of his own contribution After the changes the percentage rose to percent Employees are allowed to switch from the noncontributory plan to the contributory one which costs taxpayers more money They can retroactively buy previous years by paying percent of the salary they earned in that year plus percent interest Before the changes few employees switched to the contributory plan But afterward percent of all noncontributory employees switched in the first year and another percent switched in the second Nearly half who switched purchased credit for previous years an average of years each and the rest can still purchase back years anytime before they retire Since the pension shortfall became news this year the number of employees switching to the more lucrative plan and buying back years has actually increased The pension s new consultant said that it would be safe to assume that percent of employees in the noncontributory plan will be switching to the contributory plan in the next several years Virtually all of them will purchase some previous service years before they retire he said He requested that the board ratify the changed assumptions before he used them since they are the board s responsibility he said Since pension board members oppose White s effort to get out from under the new state law it would not help their cause to release any new more negative shortfall numbers just before the vote But they have little choice White and the city hired their own actuarial firm to make a new estimate and that number will be released before the election The pension board now will have a number to compare to the city s by May or May We re ready to get this show rolling and help out Holmes said acknowledging that something must be done to stem the funding crisis White cannot change the pension on his own He must negotiate an agreement with the pension board or get changes approved by the Legislature Holmes said he was optimistic and sounded conciliatory There are a lot of ways once we get to the table to solve these problems he said,"The estimated amount of Houston's main municipal pension funding shortfall could go up substantially within the next two weeks, after the pension board voted Wednesday to let its new actuarial consultant take into account a significant employee-enrollment trend that had been previously ignored.

The revised estimate to the shortfall, now $1 billion over the next 18 years, will be issued only days before city voters decide whether to opt out of a state law that locks in certain pension benefits.",1,

204,Despite the apparent increase in prudent financial behavior however these families on average have net wealth of only including their home equity not enough to meet major emergencies and certainly not enough to provide a comfortable retirement Half the families say they are worried about their financial situation and they are right to be said CFA Executive Director Stephen Brobeck Women the middle aged and those living in the northeastern and north central states are the most worried Brobeck noted These are areas where manufacturing jobs provide much of the employment and often the best jobs available for blue collar workers and the manufacturing sector has been hit hard by foreign competition Last week for example Carrier Corp the big refrigeration equipment division of United Technologies Corp said it would close all its manufacturing operations in Syracuse N Y and lay off workers Jobs like these typically are ones that offer blue collar workers defined benefit pensions Those are the traditional pensions that are taken care of entirely by the employer without requiring the worker to make investment decisions and that provide a lifetime stream of income in retirement Not only are such pensions less available to younger workers today but layoffs that truncate an older worker s career generally result in a lower pension as well It is not clear where families in the middle class are headed Highly skilled workers or those in growth fields such as health care continue to work for good wages but others struggle The CFA and Providian are pushing a nationwide savings program to encourage financial services firms to embed savings services in their offerings and to encourage individuals and families to save Pilot programs in Cleveland and a number of other cities have yielded positive results but it remains to be seen if the initial enthusiasm they have generated will be sustained The program is offering free enrollment online at www americasaves org It will ask you to set a goal and work out a plan to achieve it The program also provides free information about saving and saving options It is clear that the middle class needs to save and invest more The Fed data indicate that outside of rising home equity not a whole lot of that is going on It is equally clear that saving at these income levels particularly the lower end of the range isn t easy While inflation has remained under control in recent years family incomes haven t done much either other than at the high end And despite the attention given to the recent federal income tax cuts the overall tax burden on families especially property and sales taxes remains high In fact while assets per se are rarely taxed in the United States property taxes in most states are structured so that if your housing wealth rises through appreciation your taxes go up with it Primary residences get very favorable tax treatment when sold for a married couple up to in gains can escape tax entirely but if you don t sell you may have to pay a percentage point or more of that additional value every year in property tax Investors who own stocks on the other hand can hold unrealized capital gains for many years without paying any tax on them Only when such winnings are cashed in are taxes imposed The study found that only about half of middle class families own stock at all and the median value of those holdings was just in This means as the CFA pointed out that three quarters of middle class households held less than combined in individual stocks stock mutual funds and stock retirement funds This did spare them much of the pain of the recent market plunge but it raises serious doubts about their retirement prospects The bottom line for families is a simple but not easy choice Hold spending below income save and invest or figure on working well into old age Oh and one other thing if you do scrimp and save and do the right thing there s still no guarantee that you ll have enough More than percent of U S households owned individual retirement accounts as of June according to the Investment Company Institute a mutual fund trade group That brought the total to million households with IRAs up million from a year earlier About million of these were Roth IRAs which are not deductible but are tax free in retirement an increase of percent In addition to the rise in Roth IRA ownership the number of U S households that owned traditional IRAs rose to an estimated million from million a year earlier It is possible for a household to hold both types Nearly two thirds of IRA households included mutual funds in their IRAs typically stock funds Thirty eight percent of IRA households held individual stocks in their IRAs The median age of heads of households owning IRAs was The median annual income of such households was with median financial assets of of which was the IRA the ICI said For holders of traditional IRAs income was about the same but median financial assets which don t include home equity totaled with in the IRA The median is the midpoint of a group so half the IRA holders had more and half less At the end of last year assets in IRAs totaled trillion That was down percent from a year earlier but it still represented percent of the trillion U S retirement market,"Despite the stock market's all-too-recent dive, middle-class families managed to accumulate more wealth in recent years, largely because home values soared and those homes' owners apparently resisted the temptation to borrow out all their increased equity, according to a new study of Federal Reserve data.  

Households with incomes between $20,000 and $80,000 in 2001 dollars saw their net wealth rise 23 percent from 1995 to 2001, and the share of those families spending less than their income and saving regularly rose, according to the study, sponsored by the Consumer Federation of America and Providian Financial, a credit card and financial services firm.

To the Editor:



Many investors believe that analyst ""buy"" recommendations of worthless
companies are a relatively new phenomena, dating perhaps from the market
highs of 2000. Over 15 years ago, in ""The Limits of Research: How
Valuable Are Analyst's Reports?"" (Barron's, May 18, 1987), I showed that
analyst recommendations exhibited price increases of only 54% of the
price increase of the DJIA and only 70% of the price increase of the S&P
500. So, in 1987, the investor could obtain better results using a page
of Barron's and a dart. The investor of today should beware, because it
is my personal opinion that current recommendations of analysts have not
shown any improvement from their horrible performance of 1987.

223,Nearly a quarter of Baby Boomers report having no savings for retirement according to the IRI Fact Book from the Insured Retirement Institute IRI Among those Boomers who have retirement savings have balances below Citing a study by The Hartford Age of Opportunity Americans Transitioning Into Retirement the book notes that of retirees say if they could change just one aspect of their retirement it would be to save more money and be better prepared financially While automatic enrollment and auto escalation features in employer sponsored retirement plans have indeed boosted retirement savings the IRI contends that may still not be enough to ensure adequate reserves Individuals need to be more engaged in retirement planning the book argues and seeking help from a financial adviser is one of the most effective ways for workplace savers to become more proactive A number of factors e g the increased responsibility placed on individuals for structuring their own retirement income coupled with the recent headwinds from the financial crisis the subsequent recession and a slow economic recovery have created a set of economic conditions that have negatively affected the retirement savings behaviors of Baby Boomers the book says In a section titled Barriers to Saving the IRI examines some inhibitors to saving for retirement and how potential changes to tax policy can exacerbate them IRI researchers also explore how working with an adviser can help achieve desired levels of savings as well as how annuities can help as sustainable retirement income vehicles in the defined contribution DC plan context Key Findings The fact book s Barriers to Savings section reported the following regarding Boomers today have had difficulty paying their mortgage or rent in the past months have stopped contributing to a retirement plan said they would be less likely to save if capital gains taxes increased and stated they would be less likely to save if federal income taxes increased There are ways to overcome the barriers the book points out Those who work with an adviser and set up a plan tend to fare better Among Boomers who work with a financial adviser had determined a savings goal The IRI found that having a plan for retirement increases confidence levels Roughly half of the Baby Boomers with a plan prepared by an adviser said they were extremely or very confident they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement Nearly of Boomers who have consulted an adviser reported that they are very or extremely confident they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement compared with who have not consulted a financial adviser In sum confidence levels rise when people have an adviser and soar even higher when the adviser designs a financial plan The IRI found that of the Boomers working with a financial adviser said that adviser prepared a retirement plan Middle Incomers Need Advice Vast majority have had no training on financial security in retirement Eighty three percent of middle income Baby Boomers have not had any type of formal training or education about topics related to retirement financial security a study finds According to a recent survey from the Bankers Life Center for a Secure Retirement of middle income Boomers receive no professional financial guidance of any kind whether formal or informal At the same time a majority somewhat doubt they will have enough savings to last throughout retirement The lack of education services and confidence may be attributed to a disconnect between the Boomers and financial professionals Bankers Life researchers suggest The survey shows that approximately four in Boomers with between and in annual income think they do not need advice because they prefer to make their own financial decisions The survey also finds that many middle income Boomers could have inadequate retirement plans due to the tendency of the financial services industry to cater to wealthy Americans Of Boomers without a financial professional have received no solicitations in the past year Bankers Life says and another have never been contacted by one Among Boomers having an active relationship with a financial professional sought out the relationships themselves while a mere say the relationship was initiated by the advice provider Still good relationships between middle income Boomers and financial professionals can have positive results Those who do turn to a professional generally have more saved for retirement More than one quarter who work with a financial adviser have investable assets of more than compared with only of those who do not work with one Middle income Boomers should realize that not all of those working with a financial professional start with high levels of assets according to Bankers Life The study shows that while nearly half of individuals who have worked with a professional for less than two years have under in investable assets of those who worked with one for years or more have over in investable assets PA Adult Children Undermine Retirement Six in American parents support their adult children financially according to a study from the LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute SRI Parents with Millennial children most often help to pay for cell phones and mobile service college expenses and loans rent or mortgage payments and even entertainment costs such as movies or sporting events The majority of Americans with adult children have at least one of them living at home the study found and nearly three quarters of parents whose children are to years old have at least one living with them While Millennials are the most educated generation in history nearly four in are unemployed and many more are underemployed says Deb Dupont associate managing director LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute Parents of Millennials even those over the age of are providing considerable support to their children at a time in their lives when saving for retirement should be a priority she adds Nearly half of parents who have supported their adult children financially in the past year report that this has negatively affected their retirement saving The study findings are based on a nationally representative survey fielded last July of Americans PA Retirement and Health Care The American Benefits Council advocates a long term outlook on both A new strategy outline issued by the American Benefits Council ABC suggests that the advocacy group will work to achieve public policy reform that more closely unifies health care and retirement concerns According to its new strategy manifesto the ABC expects recent trends in personal health and financial well being to gain steam in the medium and long term Over that time it anticipates individuals and employers will embrace a broader view of lifetime income protection which includes not only health coverage and retirement savings but also life insurance disability and long term care coverage in a much more integrated way The main driver behind focusing attention on the need to protect lifetime income through a total financial wellness approach the ABC says is that people s lives are getting longer while the U S pension system is covering a dwindling number of people Indeed according to data the council pulled from a recent U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report the average time spent in retirement has lengthened from years in to years today for men and from years to years for women over that same time period Meanwhile individuals retiring today can expect the cost of health care to grow annually through the end of their lifetime In developing a new strategic plan the ABC concludes that in the future the three main stakeholders in the benefits system will continue to be individuals employers and the government although the roles of each will evolve Additionally the council says the principle objective of employee benefits policy will remain helping individuals achieve personal financial security although that concept is perhaps now more accurately described as personal health and financial well being The council s new strategy outline also takes into account the growing importance of global competitiveness in retirement and health coverage offerings The spreading global footprint of the largest employers and the increasing globalization of markets and economies means global competition will dictate much of the design and perceived successes of employee benefit programs by the end of the next decade the ABC says Another major consideration for the council s strategic vision is that technological advances should be expected to keep accelerating Technologies available today make possible what was unimaginable just years ago when the ABC s last strategic vision document was issued the group says John Manganaro Need to Address Health Care Pre retirees lack an action plan The third annual Nationwide Retirement Institute survey found that the majority of respondents with at least in household assets say one of their top fears in retirement is of health care costs going out of control More than half believe the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA will increase those costs Fear is doing little to inspire these pre retirees to take action however More than two in five say they would delay their retirement if they had to buy their own health insurance Roughly one quarter of employed affluent Baby Boomers say they believe they will never retire Just two years ago most affluent Boomers surveyed expressed little concern over health care costs in retirement Last year that number rose and it jumped a bit higher this year with saying they believe it will be the biggest expense throughout retirement Still these worries can lead to a positive outcome says John Carter president of Nationwide s retirement plans business in Columbus Ohio They increase the conversations around paying for health care in retirement and can be a great starting point for advisers to help retirement plan participants assess and plan for those costs We believe there is a lack of clear understanding around the Affordable Care Act Carter says noting that four in consumers report believing the ACA will increase their retirement health care costs People are unaware of how much they will need for meeting expenses in retirement he feels and do not fully understand the entire benefits landscape a picture that includes Medicare Social Security benefits and long term care Their underestimation of what health care costs in retirement can lead to these fears Carter says and in the wake of such fear and confusion many participants fail to plan According to the survey just of Baby Boomers have discussed health care costs with a financial adviser It s not just about the assets you accumulate Carter says As the ACA has gotten more ink over the last year Nationwide s survey found that the percentage of pre retirees who feel confident to very confident that they know their personal benefits and who grasp the consequences of the ACA has increased from to However confusion still abounds Over three in five affluent pre retirees say they wish they had a better understanding of Medicare coverage Nearly two thirds of affluent pre retirees enrolled in Medicare did not know that the program does not cover long term care costs There is room for us to educate more Carter says The survey results yielded few surprises he says but it did highlight that insufficient knowledge around planning for health care expenses in retirement continues to challenge pre retirees The good news is that the ACA has pulled health care into the dialogue he says Advisers need to be ready to have this conversation and be proactive He recommends using all available expense planning tools and calculators such as Nationwide s Personal Health Care Assessment Further he stresses that advisers need to gain a thorough understanding of Medicare Social Security and the ACA and know the benefits Jill Cornfield Advisers Rely On Numerous Enrollment Strategies Mail received at home Video CD ROM or DVD Social media networking internal Social media networking external Targeted mailings Mobile devices Source Prudential Study of Employee Benefits The Financial Wellness Cachet Incorporating holistic financial planning is a competitive advantage Financial wellness programs can be a value add for advisers especially when they help drive retirement readiness and address the roots of participant inactivity Financial stress is widespread says Matt Iverson founder of Retiremap in San Francisco citing a recent survey by New York Life Retirement Plan Services that indicates three quarters of the population describe themselves as stressed or extremely stressed The cause More than half point to possible financial difficulties and worry about potentially unaffordable medical expenses We all say everyone should save more but if you can t afford to save more because of credit card debt so you can t retire at these things have an effect on the employee as well as the employer Iverson says In the face of this significant stress which does not seem to be going away Iverson notes the adviser is the main point of contact to address the problem with retirement plan participants either with phone support or by working with the plan sponsor to implement a program to help them identify and set goals Contributing to the problem of financial stress Iverson says is that we live in an age of relentless marketing People are constantly exposed to commercial messaging It s hard to extract yourself from the things that provide short term gratification he says adding that part of the adviser s job is to frame things so people can make the right decisions A financial wellness program can help create that environment and raise awareness around getting people to meet their goals Iverson says While plan design features definitely play a part in preparing participants to retire advisers can bring maximum benefit to the plan by offering programs that help participants recognize the financial behaviors that make them stand in their own way so to speak We can advocate for the participants to help get them where they need to be he says Some of people s top concerns are skyrocketing medical expenses probably the No expense Iverson says and among other macroeconomic trends stagnant wages People have to do more with less he observes and within a retirement plan an adviser might have to broaden the scope of topics to cover more than just investment options Moving from financial planning to workplace financial wellness programs is not a huge leap and the impetus is partly being driven by the employer It is increasingly common for human resources HR and benefits people to see the impact on work performance of their employees financial stress Iverson says They would like aging retirees to retire but sometimes they cannot afford to and many participants continue to work at a time when their benefits and salary are more expensive on average an additional to a year for people who cannot retire Education must be relevant to employees goals Advisers should use the communication strategies that will resonate with specific targeted populations Much of the communication should help them see if they are on track to meet financial goals broadly Iverson argues not just for retirement which is generally more of a concern for people close to that milestone Jill Cornfield Overlooked Factors Retirement planners may be missing several key dynamics There is a pretty long list of variables people commonly forget to consider in their retirement savings effort says David Blanchett head of retirement research for Morningstar in Chicago First I think a serious misunderstanding of life expectancy still exists today especially how life expectancy will change in the next or years as that will impact even the older generations of people in the k system right now he says As Blanchett observes most people are aware that modern medicine continues to improve the average length of peoples lives but few understand how truly significant this is from a financial planning perspective For a year old even a five year boost in life expectancy dramatically increases his lifetime income needs It s really important for people to ask themselves not just Will I be able to retire but also Can my nest egg last years Blanchett says It s not an exact statistic but the other thing is that people who have saved in a k plan successfully are not average Americans he says When you look at the data consistent retirement plan participants tend to be somewhat healthier and wealthier than people on average which has a positive impact on longevity Further complicating the problem Blanchett says many people back load their savings effort and plan to make up for lost ground late in their career when they expect to earn their highest wages But what happens to this outlook if you learn at that you can t work anymore he says or that you have to shift to a part time position Another piece of the retirement planning picture that often gets overlooked is the sequence of return risk associated with retirement portfolios Put simply the sequence of return risk arises from the fact that an individual has to leave the work force at some specific point and begin drawing on accumulated assets This can be a major problem if the anticipated retirement date comes during a deep market trough as it did for many during the Great Recession when they saw more than or of their portfolios evaporate over a short time Some people think converting to a cash portfolio might be the answer here but cash isn t exactly safe either he says An all cash portfolio right now is essentially posting a negative rate of return after you factor in inflation And if you re earning a negative rate of return after inflation for the first years of retirement you re never going to make it over the year retirements we ve been talking about You re inevitably going to have to take on some amount of risk Blanchett adds that there is also a tendency to overlook the fact that bond holdings are subject to sequence risk as well and these may not always be a safe investment The point he says is that getting too focused on one piece of the retirement picture be it health care or housing may be problematic John Manganaro Next Level Readiness Sponsors need to enhance auto enrollment features More than three quarters of large and midsize U S employers that sponsor k and b defined contribution DC plans say retirement readiness has become a major issue for their employees A survey by Towers Watson shows that a vast majority of plan sponsors have taken steps to boost employee retirement readiness through improved plan design and communications However not all plan sponsors are optimizing these strategies For example more than two thirds of companies offer automatic enrollment to at least some of their workers but far fewer automatically re enroll noncontributors or participants deferring less than the default amount Towers Watson claims employers have the opportunity to engage both slow and stagnant savers by using re enrollment Similarly of companies provide automatic escalation but only mandate it Among sponsors that automatically enroll some or all workers approximately two thirds offer automatic escalation of contributions with making it truly automatic Aside from auto enrollment and escalation the appeal of an employer match continues to be one of the single largest influencers of the amount and level of employee savings according to Towers Watson The company s North American Defined Contribution Plan Sponsor Survey found of plan sponsors offer a matching contribution to some or all of their workers One third of employees save at the match threshold and another third save more Knowing that many employees tend to save at the match level provides the opportunity for employers to reshape the match to encourage increased participant savings and improved retirement readiness Towers Watson states Fifty four percent of companies offer Roth features in their plans up from in the survey found Additionally of respondents are considering or planning to add Roth features by Of those that currently have a Roth provision also allow other after tax contribution options While post tax offerings have increased utilization of the strategy still remains low with only of highly compensated employees and of non highly compensated employees using Roth accounts to save Towers Watson suggests that organizations wanting to be proactive about driving up the use of their Roth provisions should target messages to employees not currently making such contributions The Towers Watson North American Defined Contribution Plan

229,While this opinion may be viewed simply as Fayette Resources failing to make an adequate record below the case also illustrates the confusion created by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court s decision in the Mesivtah case Mesivtah Eitz Chaim of Bobov Inc v Pike County Board of Assessment Appeals A d Pa which held that non profit entities must satisfy both the statutory requirements of the Purely Public Charity Act Charity Act codified at P S and the court established HUP test When the HUP test was developed by the Supreme Court in there was no statute implementing the charitable exemption for purely public charities under Article VIII Section a v of the Pennsylvania Constitution When the Charity Act was passed in however the legislature filled that void and created what should be the standard against which such questions are evaluated unless the statute itself is declared unconstitutional either on its face or as applied Instead in Mesivtah the Supreme Court required that entities meet both tests which can lead to inconsistent results as occurred here The Commonwealth Court recognized that Fayette Resources satisfies all of the statutory requirements imposed by the Charity Act nevertheless it overturned the exemption because it found that an element of the HUP test was not met Even apart from the dual standard itself it is troubling that Fayette Resources which provides staffed homes for the intellectually disabled who are legitimate subjects of charity is exempt from federal taxation relieves the government of the duty and burden to care for the intellectually disabled and has no private profit motive was found not to have established its entitlement to a real estate tax exemption because it did not show that its costs exceeded its revenues This rationale appears to conflict with the evidence that Fayette Resources is compensated by Medicaid payments that any surplus revenues are directed back into acquisition or fixing up of group homes and that distribution of any funds for a private purpose is prohibited by the organization s by laws Is the Court saying that an entity must lose money on a consistent basis to be entitled to a real estate tax exemption Must it solicit charitable contributions to establish its claim These are the types of questions the legislature answered in the Public Charity Act The Supreme Court s and here the Commonwealth Court s insistence on applying the less detailed court established standard of the HUP test in addition to the Public Charity Act standards only creates confusion and additional costs to charities who must repeatedly litigate the vagaries of the HUP test the very result the legislature attempted to avoid Disclaimer This Alert has been prepared and published for informational purposes only and is not offered nor should be construed as legal advice For more information please see the firm s full disclaimer Mr Philip Lebowitz Duane Morris LLP South th Street Philadelphia UNITED STATES E mail solutions duanemorris com URL www duanemorris com Click Here for related articles c Mondaq Ltd Tel http www mondaq com,"On December 23, 2014, the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania logged another frustrating mile down the confused and confusing road of property tax exemption for purely public charities.Â  In Fayette Resources, Inc. v.

233,They took risks in leaving their country and now they are risk averters in the extreme They keep their registered retirement savings plans in GICs earning per cent a year and their taxable investments in bank accounts at per cent a year They have no registered education savings plan for their two children ages and We have been in Canada for only six years Phil explains But we want to send our kids to university and plan retirement Will we be able to afford to do that What our expert says Facelift asked Derek Moran a registered financial planner who heads Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with Phil and Elizabeth There are challenges Mr Moran explains Phil simply will not take risks with investments He has suffered equity losses and doesn t want to repeat them The most conservative investment strategy would be for the couple to pay off their mortgage balance as fast as possible with their monthly savings Once the mortgage is discharged they will be able to save a month In the next three years Elizabeth s income should rise to a year For now assuming that Elizabeth puts a year into her RRSP and that Phil puts into his RRSP that the couple expands their portfolio to include assets that can generate returns of per cent a year and that inflation runs at per cent a year then at Phil s age they will have in dollars in their RRSP At his age they would have However if they stick with their GICs earning per cent a year they would have at age Mr Moran estimates After their mortgage is paid off they will be able to save a month in the RRSPs and to put into cash investments If these taxable funds were to generate per cent a year after taxes and inflation the portfolio would rise to at Phil s age and at his age If the couple sticks with GICs and makes a zero return after taxes and inflation they will have a total portfolio equal to their initial savings plus inflation in dollars The after tax result could actually be negative depending on interest rates tax rates and inflation the planner notes Not only do Phil and Elizabeth have high tax exposure on their earned incomes they also fail to take full advantage of RRSP contribution room Their situation is made worse by their preference for GICs which are very safe but have low returns In the end they add to their tax problems by adding fully taxed interest income to their fully taxed professional incomes Given the couple s preference for staying in cash the course of least resistance is to pay down their mortgage The per cent they earn on GICs leaves per cent after tax and is actually a negative return once Alberta s brisk rate of inflation is taken in account Mr Moran says If they pay down their mortgage balance they will earn the per cent they pay in interest For Phil and Elizabeth this is a relatively attractive way to use their cash he adds The rest of their savings can be used to fill the couple s RRSP space Phil has of available contribution room Elizabeth has of space The contributions even if left in cash within the accounts would produce tax deductions of and respectively The next move should be to incorporate their separate professional incomes They each generate high cash savings after they pay their living expenses They could each have a company that would earn income then pay out salaries The salaries would be set to maximize their RRSP contributions Money retained in the company would be taxed at just per cent in Alberta They would have per cent of original undistributed corporate income to invest It is a better deal than investing the money after they have paid personal tax that leaves them with only to per cent of their pretax income Mr Moran says When retained earnings are eventually paid out they will be taxed as Canadian source dividends subject to lower taxes than ordinary earned income Deferral of personal taxes for many years effectively makes it possible to earn money on what can be regarded as the government s money Mr Moran notes It s rather late to start a registered education savings plan for the kids but Phil and Elizabeth could set up a family trust and pay out earnings from the corporations to be taxed in the hands of the children This plan requires that the children be years old They are likely to be in a zero tax bracket The family trust makes use of postponed contributions from existing savings There are no annual contribution limits either though the downside of the plan is that there is no Canada Education Savings Grant boost each year to parental contributions However tax savings more than offset the grant Mr Moran notes If Phil works to age he can expect per cent of the maximum Canada Pension Plan payment of a year and if he works to age Elizabeth would receive the same ratio and get at age and at age They will receive Old Age Security at age based on being in Canada for years out of the needed to qualify for full OAS benefits Under revised rules that would give Phil of the maximum of a year and Elizabeth of a year That works out to and respectively If the couple sticks with GICs for all of their investments their retirement income would be about at age If they expand their portfolio to half bonds and half stocks and generate a per cent annual return and retire at age they can expect retirement income of If they retire at age their income would be if they remain fully invested in GICs and if they use the half bond half stock portfolio the planner calculates This couple has the discipline to save and to build significant retirement savings Mr Moran says Their problem is to overcome their fear of loss in capital markets They may have some losses if they buy stocks and fixed income assets but they are certain to have losses of purchasing power if they

to use Duringa committee hearing in parliament in December for example BritishSteel shift operations manager Rich Caddy said the complex system of menus and drop down boxes meant you need some sort of degree to find a suitably qualified financial adviser The FCA also faced criticism from adviser body The Personal Investment Management Financial Advice Association PIMFA which said the registerhad an inadequate search facility and excessive use of regulatory jargon in the register entries The report continued The FCA online register is a potentially valuable resource but is currently very confusing Vital consumer protection information such as the suspensions of permissions must be given far greater prominence The committee recommended the watchdog should make any pension transfer suspensions clear at the top of register entries and in search results More broadly it called for the register to be redesiged entirely Additionally the committee urged the FCA not to drop the requirement on advisers to start from the presumption that a DB transfer is a bad idea for their client as proposed in their consultation Whose side is FCA on Field said he struggled to fathom how contingent fees have ever been acceptable for providing impartial advice on a decision such as a pension transfer Our financial services regulator has been rejigged and rebranded but I can t see much

that advice It is important not to throw the baby out with the bath water in this case he said The right lesson is to clamp down on those who seek to exploit people and scam them out of their pension

summarising the various pieces ofinformation and evidence it has collected on the British Steel saga over the past couple of months The report claims contingent charging is a key driver of poor advice adding Genuine independence is not compatible with a charging model that only rewards advisers for recommending a particular course of action According to the committee contingent charging gives rise to an inherent conflict of interest and the guidance and monitoringofit by the Financial Conduct Authority FCA has failed BSPS pensioners Active Wealth an advice firm that was accused of giving poor advice to steelworkers and has sinceentered liquidation admitted of its BSPS clients paid using contingent charging in a letter to Work and Pensions committee chair Frank Field The reportrevealed the average value of BSPS pension benefits transferred out was although in around cases the transfer value exceeded m Additionally itfound advice fees were typically around of the transfer value FCA register confusing The report also urged the FCA to reform its register which lists the details of all regulated financial advisers and their firm BSPS trustees and members were both reliant on the register to identify which firms could conduct pension transfer business it said Both however said it was difficult to use Duringa committee hearing in parliament in December for example BritishSteel shift operations manager Rich Caddy said the complex system of menus and drop down boxes meant you need some sort of degree to find a suitably qualified financial adviser The FCA also faced criticism from adviser body The Personal Investment Management Financial Advice Association PIMFA which said the registerhad an inadequate search facility and excessive use of regulatory jargon in the register entries The report continued The FCA online register is a potentially valuable resource but is currently very confusing Vital consumer protection information such as the suspensions of permissions must be given far greater prominence The committee recommended the watchdog should make any pension transfer suspensions clear at the top of register entries and in search results More broadly it called for the register to be redesiged entirely Additionally the committee urged the FCA not to drop the requirement on advisers to start from the presumption that a DB transfer is a bad idea for their client as proposed in their consultation Whose side is FCA on Field said he struggled to fathom how contingent fees have ever been acceptable for providing impartial advice on a decision such as a pension transfer Our financial services regulator has been rejigged and rebranded but I can t see much evidence of it working better for the people it is meant to protect individuals making life

239,Why does this matter to us in the retirement benefits profession Because one of the first tax preferences that will be put on the table in any budget discussion is the one for retirement savings According to EBRI the tax benefit for employment based retirement plans accounts for billion of the total budget for Even nowadays that s real money Just what is this tax benefit The big benefit is this Employers when they set money aside for a tax qualified pension plan e g a k plan or a DB plan get an immediate deduction the money grows tax free in a tax exempt trust and it is not taxed until it is distributed to the employee Why should retirement savings get this special treatment A lot of people think they shouldn t On the left there are those who assert that this tax benefit goes mainly to high margin high paid employees who don t need the favorable treatment and whose savings behavior would not change if it were eliminated On the right there are those who assert that this favorable tax treatment should be provided for all savings not just retirement savings These voices are sure to be heard in any budget based debate about the continuing utility of favorable tax treatment of retirement savings At this point when we re talking about the elimination of favorable tax treatment I think the critique from the left is the more significant one The standard counterargument has been that the current system encourages employers in order to get favorable tax treatment to provide retirement benefits to a broad cross section of employees not just the high paid That argument needs to be made again However those on the left have a point With the decline in DB plans and the prevalence of k plans it s unclear that the low paid really are receiving adequate retirement benefits under the current system Whether automatic enrollment will solve this problem remains to be seen Certainly defenders of the current system will need to produce data showing that the retirement benefits tax expenditure does benefit all employees There s a mildly subtle point here This tax expenditure like any deduction based tax expenditure generally goes to higher margin taxpayers That s a given However if the result is that retirement savings go up for everybody that the tax benefit provides employers an incentive to get everybody in a plan then it s worth it There s another point It has long been recognized that any income tax system is biased against savings Interest is just compensation for the deferral of spending If you tax interest as income which ours and other income tax systems do taxpayers will have an artificial incentive to spend rather than save The retirement savings tax benefit mitigates this effect In the current neo neo Keynesian moment saving versus spending is not favored but in the long run and in real life you need savings As all the ads keep telling us you particularly need retirement savings Of course Keynes famously said In the long run we re all dead What exactly did he know in that in we do not Michael Barry is President of the Plan Advisory Services Group a consulting group that helps financial services corpor ations with the regulatory issues facing their plan sponsor clients He has had years experience in the benefits field in law and consulting firms,"Itâ€™s not really clear right now what the new Congress is going to be like. The easy prediction is that, with many moderate Democrats gone and the new crop of Tea Party-inspired Republicans, the two sides will spend most of their time shouting at each other and waiting for 2012. However, itâ€™s conceivable that enough of them will want to ""do what the American people sent us here to do"" that they will try to ""work together"" and ""compromise"" and ""do something."" What exactly might they do?

The clear, highest-priority, semi-nonpolarizing issue is the budget, and there is a bipartisan proposal already out thereâ€”the Bowles-Simpson budget commission non-reportâ€”laying out a road map. A key element of any attempt to ""fix"" the budget is tax reform and, in that regard, the Bowles-Simpson proposal, which raises revenues by lowering rates but expanding the tax base and eliminating tax preferences, has a lot of appeal.",1,

243,People come to their wedding thinking they have to present their station in life to the world even if they cannot afford it says Lauren Rutten a wedding photographer in South Orange N J Big cars big presents such extravagance is in our mentality now That makes it hard to put things into perspective The cost of the average American wedding and honeymoon is now pegged at to according to various surveys Even industry experts are saying Basta It really is pretty exorbitant when you see how much all the different elements of a wedding can cost says Diane Forden editor in chief of Bridal Guide You have to realize less is more Who needs the limo with the fully stocked bar and the TV Three rules help with the hard work of keeping costs in check Hold down the size of the wedding Rein in its extravagance And rethink traditional expectations That could mean excluding some cousins saying no to the five course meal and ditching extras such as favors You might consider marrying on a day other than Saturday limiting liquor options and calling upon the skills of friends and relatives To start focus on the biggest bills the ones for the party Seriously the cost of the reception site was just overwhelming says Megan Fitzpatrick a year old bride to be from Jersey City N J I really had no idea Many places she checked had a person minimum to book a Saturday reception To compensate she and her fiance kept their bridal party to six people and are having an informal family barbecue for their rehearsal dinner The rehearsal tends to get blown out of proportion and can end up becoming a mini wedding Fitzpatrick says Even with all the rented silverware and linen tent weddings are still usually less expensive than restaurants or banquet halls especially if you can plunk those poles down in a park on a beach or on a relative s well manicured lawn Whether the walls are fabric or sheetrock you will need to decorate And many couples end up shocked by their flower bill You don t need huge elaborate centerpieces on every table says Forden She suggests buying local flowers in season using hand tied bouquets and substituting candles for some centerpieces Brides can also reuse church flowers at the reception but someone has to move them or check out fruit and dried flower arrangements If your guests are artists or gardeners put their talents to use As their gift they could design decorations grow flowers for centerpieces or create banners or invitations Such personal touches make a wedding unique and can deepen your friendship in a way that just receiving a toaster can t As for food look into buffets with servers they reduce the amount of food wasted Offer a wide variety of breads and salads Or ditch the heavy meal altogether If hors d oeuvres reportedly were good enough for Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher they could be good enough for you You can have a wonderful cocktail party great music and dancing serve hors d oeuvres and cake says Forden Keep the cake to two layers and garnish it with real flowers she adds The higher the cake the more expensive and elaborate sugar flowers involve a lot of labor Eileen Monaghan vice president of the nearly member Association of Bridal Consultants says liquor bills can run hundreds of dollars past expectations unless couples are careful Instead of an open bar she suggests a select menu of wine beer and one

248,Putting off action that will boost your financial well being is not about a shortage of money or having too much debt It s more about a lack of confidence in money matters and not having the right mind set the study found Seven in Americans postpone making financial decisions at least some of the time the study found Perhaps more startling is that more than half of the adults surveyed had not made a big money related decision such as making a large purchase a home opening an investment account or moving money around in a k account in the past three years But what s behind the inaction the I ll get to it another day mentality may surprise you The only thing holding you back is you said Jerry Patterson senior vice president of retirement and income solutions at Principal Financial Group More specifically how your brain is wired or miswired when it comes to money is a major obstacle What makes Principal s research different from other surveys that address retirement savings readiness is that it views investors decision making through the prism of behavioral finance In other words it takes into consideration how emotions psychology and behavioral biases can impede or advance a person s savings goals The study asked respondents questions that explored behavioral finance concepts such as recency effect a bias in which people tend to extrapolate recent events such as a big upward move in stock prices into the future indefinitely It also posed queries related to loss aversion or the idea that losses generally have a much larger psychological impact than gains of the same size People have their reasons for postponing saving for retirement Patterson said Unfortunately some of those reasons are not as valid as they think Some of the circumstances people think are barriers are actually just challenges that can be overcome with the right mind set For example while of the respondents said their current income is the biggest reason they don t pull the trigger on financial decisions Principal s research showed that current finances or lack of money do not play a significant role in procrastination If it s true that lack of income or debt is getting in the way of making decisions then debt levels and income levels should explain who is and who isn t postponing decisions but those factors didn t explain the behavior said Goldstein an expert in decision making and former professor at London Business School who now works as principal researcher at Microsoft Research Indeed even one in four high income households those earning more than per year were part of the group that postponed financial decisions And only about half said they would feel confident planning for their retirement What s more the research noted that it only takes a modest income say for people to begin to feel comfortable enough to make decisions that will affect their long term savings So what then exactly is to blame for the inaction A lack of knowledge and confidence related to investing Patterson said Those who do not feel confident about their finances are two times more likely to postpone making major decisions than those who are confident regardless of income the research found New features such as k s with automatic enrollment or robots that build low cost diversified portfolios for people online have helped investors Boosting your confidence and getting over the intimidation of investing isn t as hard as it sounds Seek help from a financial adviser Seek knowledge on the Internet You can get answers to your questions with one or two clicks of a mouse Patterson said,"Too little cash.

257,For years homeowners have relied on brokers to find the most affordable mortgages but the dramatic freeze on lending means that many of the best deals are now available only if you approach a bank or building society direct First time buyers and homeowners coming to the end of their existing deals are therefore being urged to explore every possibility in the pursuit of a cheap loan It could still be worth contacting a good mortgage broker especially if your circumstances are out of the ordinary but it also means checking whether you can find a better deal by approaching a lender direct As the mortgage freeze has escalated an increasing number of lenders have decided that they no longer want to deal through brokers Last week Scarborough Building Society axed all of the mortgage products that it sold through intermediaries Other high street names such as Cheltenham Gloucester still deal through brokers but they do not offer them their best rates First Direct Woolwich and the Post Office all offer competitive mortgages that are only available direct HSBC meanwhile made the headlines last week by introducing its Rate Matcher mortgage This allows borrowers coming to the end of a fixed rate deal with another lender to match their old rate for a further two years There are restrictions however Homeowners cannot borrow more than per cent of a property s value and the maximum loan is Pounds The minimum rate that the bank will match is per cent and all deals will be fixed for two years The deal is also available only to borrowers who apply direct to HSBC Analysts say that lenders have been cutting the number of deals available through brokers in an attempt to discourage borrowers In the current climate lenders who offer even vaguely competitive deals are being inundated with applications Dealing directly with the public means that banks and building societies also make more money for themselves Most brokers are paid commission for every deal that they recommend Cut out the broker and the lender keeps that cash There are a number of ways that borrowers can keep on top of what is on offer James Thorpe of HSBC says Customers can find out about the direct only deals on the market by checking newspapers websites and advertisements on television It definitely pays for customers to shop around Some price comparison websites such as Moneysupermarket com and Moneyfacts co uk allow borrowers to check out the whole market before choosing specific deals Most sites will include the criteria for the deals listed which is increasingly important as lenders reserve their best deals for customers who are considered very low risk Louise Cuming of Moneysupermarket says Lenders are cherrypicking borrowers and the best deals that you see advertised are generally only for borrowers who have squeaky clean credit records By using the search engines on price comparison websites borrowers can search for deals available to new customers with similar credit histories incomes or sizes of deposit The result is a list of the deals that are likely to be available to you The best three year fix on Moneysupermarket is per cent with Abbey The arrangement fee is Pounds and the loan is available to those borrowing up to per cent of a property s value Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds The most competitive three year fixed rate deal through London and Country the broker is from Halifax with a rate of per cent and an arrangement fee of Pounds The maximum loan to value LTV ratio is per cent Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds HSBC has a direct only deal with a discounted rate of per cent for two years The monthly repayments would be Pounds The fee is Pounds and the maximum LTV is per cent The best discounted deal from a broker is with Dunfermline Building Society which is offering a rate of per cent with a Pounds fee The maximum LTV is per cent and monthly repayments on the same Pounds loan would be Pounds Despite most of the best deals being those direct from the lenders it may still be worth asking a broker what it can offer Many of the biggest companies do not charge a fee for advice because they are paid commission if you agree a deal so you lose nothing if you walk away Melanie Bien of Savills Private Finance the broker says The cheapest deals might be direct only but there will be strict criteria Brokers can give borrowers tailored advice on the best deals available to them For example increasingly we are getting people who have been turned down by their original lender or who have a missed payment on their credit report which has adversely affected their credit ratings Whether borrowers find deals that suit their requirements through an intermediary or online the message is the same don t hang around John Postlethwaite of Punter Southall an independent financial adviser says Deals that are there one day may not be the next When you find a good deal call the lender straight away and check it is available If it is book an appointment SIMON J POPE CASE STUDY DAN PIRONTI left and his partner Karen Davies have bought a six bedroom house in Clapham South London at auction for

rate of per cent Mr Pironti and Ms Davies will collect the keys less than a month after they first viewed the property Mr Pironti who works as a procurement consultant says We went straight to a broker because in my experience when you need something done quickly it pays to speak to the experts High street lenders do not always advertise all their deals so you need to speak to someone who

7.14. Gamut of expansion strategies undertaken by Aegis and steadily rising LPG usage in India is expected to buoy its business in the coming years. Infrastructure status granted by the government to logistics sector will ease availability of funds to build modern infrastructure for managing complex supply chains. Its existing and new customer relationships should drive volumes at current and new capacities. JV with ITOCHU will help it become a leading LPG sourcing player in India.

288,Among the plans the National Association of State Retirement Administrators NASRA measured in nearly three fourths reduced their investment return assumption since fiscal year A brief from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College says such a change is generally viewed as a positive development for pension funding discipline bringing assumptions more in line with market expectations and forcing plan sponsors to increase annual required contributions However the researchers say the decline in assumed rates of return is actually due to lower assumed inflation not a lower assumed real return that is the return net of inflation In a fully indexed system where benefits fully adjust with inflation a lower inflation assumption should actually have no impact on costs however public pension plans have also changed their asset allocations resulting in a higher expected real return which lowers costs Therefore a quick assessment of these underlying assumption changes suggests that plans may have actually lowered their costs with the decline in the assumed return the brief says But public plan benefits are not fully indexed so the real value of benefits increases as the inflation expectation drops which increases plan costs The researchers explain that for a hypothetical plan where benefits fully adjust with inflation lower inflation will have no impact on the required contribution because the lower revenue produced by lower nominal returns will be offset by a decrease in initial benefits through lower wage growth and the cost of living adjustment COLA paid after retirement However the actual situation for public plans differs in two ways Benefits before and after retirement are not fully linked to inflation so they do not decline one to one with lower inflation therefore increasing the real value of benefits and increasing plan costs and public plans have shifted into riskier assets which increases their expected real return and reduces costs Public plans may seem like fully indexed systems because they provide benefits based on final earnings and offer post retirement COLAs the brief says But in reality not all benefits are based on final earnings and most COLAs are not designed to fully compensate for inflation It further explains that if all public sector workers remained with their employer until they retired their final earnings would reflect inflation and real wage growth over their work lives and their initial benefits based on final earnings would be fully indexed however of employees who vest in a pension benefit do not retire as public sector employees so they receive much lower benefits for their time in the public sector than employees who finish their career in the public sector The only way for a worker who leaves public sector employment before retirement to avoid a loss in benefits would be for the plan to base pension benefits on projected age earnings that is index earnings for inflation and real wage growth Without such indexing benefits erode in real terms and the higher the rate of inflation the larger the erosion With a lower rate of inflation the cost to the employer increases by making the deferred benefits relatively more expensive In addition the researchers say most COLAs are deliberately designed not to fully match inflation and some plans provide no COLA or only ad hoc adjustments meaning the benefits of many retirees erode in value over time with rising inflation When the inflation rate declines since the drop in benefit payouts does not fully reflect the drop in inflation costs rise At the extreme for plans without a COLA a percentage point reduction in assumed inflation produces a percentage point increase in real post retirement benefits The lack of complete indexing of both initial benefits and benefits after retirement means that a change in inflation is not a wash Instead as inflation declines real costs increase the brief explains At the same time public pension plans have also shifted their investment mix out of fixed income and into riskier asset classes with higher expected real returns which all else equal leads to lower costs as fewer contributions are required to meet future benefit obligations Using data reported under the new Government Accounting Standards Board GASB statements the researchers calculated the net effect on plan costs due to the lower inflation assumption and higher expected real return assuming a percentage point decrease in inflation and a percentage point increase in the real return They found a change in accrued liabilities and a roughly increase in employee liabilities and the associated normal costs In addition using these assumptions a plan s required contribution would increase by of payroll However lowering assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation was actually better for plans than if they did so due to a lower assumed real return because the researchers found that under a hypothetical scenario in which lower assumed returns are driven by a reduction in the assumed real return the increase in the required contribution would be over three times as high at of payroll,"Researchers found a decline in assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation combined with a change in asset allocations, resulting in a higher expected real return, has increased costs for public pensions, but the increase is much smaller than if the decline in the assumed return was due to a lower assumed real return.

In the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis, global interest rates and inflation have remained low by historic standards, and these low interest rates, along with low rates of projected global economic growth, have led to reductions in projected returns for most asset classes, which, in turn, have resulted in an unprecedented number of reductions in the investment return assumption used by public pension plans.",0,

290,This was lower than the amount of money typically deposited pre pandemic which averaged billion per month in the year to February Thomas Pugh an economist at RSM UK said The latest Money and Credit figures suggest that consumers are borrowing more and saving less as they try to maintain their lifestyles in the face of surging inflation Normally a rise in consumer credit is a good indication that consumption is growing strongly because it tends to expand when the economy is good People feel confident enough to borrow and splurge on big ticket items such as cars However this time may be different A rise in consumer borrowing over the next year may suggest that consumers are dealing with high inflation and attempting to maintain their lifestyles by borrowing Indeed we know that retail sales volumes slumped in December so it seems unlikely that the billion increase in consumer credit in December was due to consumers buying more goods Households had been putting larger amounts of cash away earlier on in the pandemic In the year to November the average amount being deposited per month stood at billion,"Households are borrowing more and putting less money into savings, according to Bank of England figures. Some experts pointed to the statistics as evidence of people trying to maintain their lifestyles as their incomes are battered by high inflation. Experts also said the figures suggest that householders are starting to dip into extra savings built up during the pandemic as they juggle rising bills. Consumer credit, which includes borrowing on credit cards, personal loans and overdrafts, increased by 1.4 per cent annually in December 2021, accelerating from 0.8 per cent in November, the Bank's Money and Credit report said. It marked the strongest annual growth in consumer credit borrowing since the start of the UK lockdowns in March 2020. Within the latest total, credit card borrowing increased by 2.0 per cent annually. Households also deposited Â£3.2 billion into banks, building societies and NS&I (National Savings and Investments) accounts in December.",1,

Earlier this month, New York's attorney general challenged the proposed fee on the estate of Leona Helmsley, who owned a vast real-estate portfolio at the time of her death nine years ago. The $100 million sought by the executors is ""astronomical"" and should be cut, potentially by about 90%, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. Many states have a sliding scale of fees based on estate size; on a $1 million estate, the fee is often around $30,000, or 3%, says Hugh Magill, chief fiduciary officer at Northern Trust.

294,The decision of Bernard Bernard FamCA provides a reminder of the importance of structuring a testamentary trust in the estate planning phase and sets out the factors that the Family Court will consider when deciding whether the assets of a testamentary trust will form part of the matrimonial pool The facts The husband and his sister both had testamentary trusts established under the Will of their father Both were the trustee of the other s trust Neither was a beneficiary of the other s testamentary trust The wife argued that the assets of the husband s testamentary trust should be included in the matrimonial pool The decision or indirectThe Court decided that the assets of the testamentary trust should not be included in the matrimonial pool because the husband did not have any direct control of the trust The trustee and appointor roles are not the only factors In this case it was fairly clear that the husband did not have any direct control of the trust he was neither a trustee nor the appointor The case also demonstrates that these are not the only relevant factors for a court to consider in determining whether the assets of the trust can be included in the matrimonial pool of assets The court will also look at any evidence that suggests that the beneficiary indirectly controls the trust including requirements for the beneficiary to provide consent before the trustee can make certain decisions the dealings of the trustee and whether they have acted as a mere puppet of the beneficiary i e acting in accordance with the wishes or at the direction of the beneficiary In this case the Court reviewed the conduct of the sister as trustee of the husband s trust including her resolutions relating to distribution of the trust assets and decisions to accumulate income along with the trust s tax returns Having concluded that the husband did not have any direct or indirect control of the trust the Court considered that the husband only had an entitlement to the testamentary trust as a mere discretionary beneficiary On this basis the assets of the trust were not included in the matrimonial pool but the husband s interest as a beneficiary was considered a financial resource although the Court noted that it is difficult to value this resource in circumstances where the husband has no present entitlement Conclusion Testamentary trusts can assist in protecting inherited assets from a matrimonial dispute It is imperative that the testamentary trust is properly drafted in the estate planning phase to ensure that the control of the trust is structured properly balancing the need for protection and the practical circumstances of the client Advisors also need to be aware that the asset protection benefits of a testamentary trust are not achieved simply through the structure of the trustee and appointor the ongoing administration of the trust the way the trustee carries out their role and the records maintained by the trustee are all relevant factors Cooper Grace Ward Lawyers Cooper Grace Ward is a leading Australian law firm based in Brisbane This publication is for information only and is not legal advice You should obtain advice that is specific to your circumstances and not rely on this publication as legal advice If there are any issues you would like us to advise you on arising from this publication please contact Cooper Grace Ward Lawyers Mr Scott Bartlem Cooper Grace Ward Level George Street Brisbane QLD AUSTRALIA Tel Fax E mail communication cgw com au URL www cgw com au Click Here for related articles c Mondaq Ltd Tel http www mondaq com,"A testamentary trust is a trust established under a Will.

295,The waiting list for planned care currently stands at mn patients a figure that Coffey claimed had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic The government is proposing changes to the NHS pension scheme in order to boost the health service s capacity We know that people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons she said For instance currently pension rules can be a disincentive for clinicians who want to stay in the profession she admitted or to return from retirement and help our national endeavour We will correct those pension rules relating to inflation Coffey continued We will expect NHS trusts to offer pension recycling and we will extend until measures that will allow people to stay or to return to the NHS Former health secretary and current health and social care select committee chair Jeremy Hunt welcomed the government s planned pension rule changes from the backbenches In August Hunt called for an immediate exemption for doctors to public sector pension rules which are currently forcing them to retire in their fifties in alarming numbers Correcting inflation woes The standard pensions annual allowance is However a taper lowers the annual tax free allowance for pension contributions from to as low as for those NHS Pension Scheme members earning an adjusted income of more than and a threshold income of more than Those that surpass the limit however are slapped with tax bills while members also face a lifetime allowance of mn The NHS Business Services Authority has struggled to cope with a surge in retirements which in the three months to April were per cent higher than in the same period over the previous five years according to the Health Service Journal NHS Digital statistics showed that there were retirements in the three months to April The spike in retirements has caused a delay in pension payments In a statement the Department for Health and Social Care announced the introduction of new retirement flexibilities which will include a partial retirement option for staff to draw on their pension and continue building it while working more flexibly allowing retired staff to build more pension if returning to service The government also committed to fix the unintended impacts of inflation so senior clinicians aren t taxed more than is necessary To achieve this it will amend the revaluation date in the NHS Pension Scheme to reduce the risk that NHS staff face annual allowance tax charges as a result of high inflation In August the Policy Exchange think tank called for a reassessment of the link between consumer price inflation and the annual allowance for public sector pensions Previously legislation ensured that only pensions growth above inflation was assessed as the rate of CPI used to revalue benefits in the career average revalued earnings section of the NHS Pension Scheme was the same rate of CPI applied to uplift annual allowance calculations This changed in April however when pension input periods were changed to align annually from April to April These are the periods over which the amount of pension saving under an arrangement is measured The Policy Exchange report argued that the design of the legislation has created two unintended consequences It noted that when CPI rises members are now assessed for their growth in benefits including inflation When CPI falls the annual allowance growth may be negative Negative growth is zeroed and cannot be carried across to other pension schemes within the same tax year or carried back to previous tax years to offset historic tax charges the report stated Pensions recycling carries legal risks In June members of the British Medical Association demanded support for employers to offer the recycling of pension contributions Pension recycling in this setting entails the passing on of unused employers pension contributions to an opted out member of the pension scheme as part of their total reward The government has now responded to this request announcing that by all trusts will be required to offer pensions recycling meaning employer pension contributions can be offered in cash instead of as an addition to pension funds helping retain senior staff who have reached the lifetime allowance for tax free pension saving The NHS Employers website guided in March that pensions recycling may be considered necessary to recognise the fact that staff who have opted out of the scheme due to pension tax issues will not get the full value of benefits from their employer s pension contribution in comparison to other colleagues It warned however of legal risks associated with recycling Employers should weigh up the impact of recycling on pay equality and the gender pay gap it warned especially where recycling is offered to one group of staff and not others Employers could also be accused of using recycling as an incentive for employees to leave the NHS Pension Scheme the guidance added Under the automatic enrolment regulations NHS Employers cautioned employers should not take any action for the sole or main purpose of inducing a worker to give up membership of a relevant scheme without becoming an active member of another relevant scheme The Department for Health and Social Care policy paper on NHS also revealed the government will be implementing permanent retirement flexibilities and extending existing temporary measures to allow our most experienced staff to return to service or stay in service longer In August the government announced new proposals in a consultation which extended an existing suspension on the application of rules around retire and return The rules which ordinarily require suspension and abatement of pensions for returning workers who exceed certain thresholds were originally suspended in March in a bid to make up a potential staff shortage resulting from the Covid pandemic The suspension was due to be lifted in October this year but the government has now proposed an extension meaning the rules would not be reapplied until March In reaction to the government s announcement Hymans Robertson partner Chris Noon said Interventions like this continue to highlight the inappropriateness of the pension taxation system The complications of the annual and lifetime allowances make it difficult for many individuals to save for retirement and ultimately have political consequences like we have seen with NHS staff in recent years he noted adding that Treasury should dust off the review of pension taxation that it came close to implementing in Alex Janiaud is deputy editor at FTAdviser s sister publication Pensions Expert,"The government will be correcting pension rules regarding inflation and will mandate NHS trusts to offer pension recycling by 2023, as part of its bid to prevent punitive pensions rules from encouraging workers to leave the National Health Service.

300,What the group failed to say but clearly implied is that the nauseating ride of the stock market and the flagging confidence of investors has made consumers more vulnerable to financial scams than at any time in memory While savvy investors like to think of scams as only luring in suckers and dupes Karen Tyler president of NASAA and the securities commissioner for North Dakota says that the evidence arriving at regulatory offices every day suggests otherwise It s not just suckers that are being taken in right now she says It seems that even people with a high degree of financial literacy can be convinced to do something right now that might otherwise defy logic or seem irrational It s just how people are reacting to the market The rapid run up in energy prices has brought back countless old ploys about oil and gas exploration and development as well as the always promising new technologies that pledge increased energy efficiency or the ability to get to resources once thought too expensive to harvest The financial predators and con criminals really mimic what is going on in the economy today borrowing from the headlines and crafting their scams based on the headlines and what is making the news to make things seem more legitimate Tyler said Let s face it high energy prices are something we are all thinking about today When the con criminal calls and pitches the net greatest thing coming out of the energy sector that will alleviate high oil prices and enhance production people are willing to listen She added It s easy to sell people on the idea that the demand for energy will keep going up and that they can cash in here doing much better than they can with their other investments Bubble trouble Likewise the real estate bubble and subprime lending crisis have brought new schemes about property related investments Even the emerging technology of the Internet is helping Tyler noted that NASAA members are concerned that rogues will use social networking ties and Web site community features to ingratiate themselves to like minded individuals then take advantage of that relationship Some networking sites make it easy for scam artists to post fraudulent investment ideas and many people are too trusting of their new online friends One reason the social network sites can become a problem in the current economic situation is that the chat boards and other interpersonal relationships can easily lead to a call to action Where that kind of push might seem forced in many settings it s not unusual for an online community to follow a few leaders reporting good results or rallying the troops for change Sidetracked goals The issue also stretches into the world of established legitimate investments that may be ill suited for some consumers One theme common to the investment advisory community these days is that brokers and financial planners have tools to help the investor reach their goals In many cases these can be complex equity indexed annuity products or variable annuity deals but not too long ago it was simply tilting a portfolio toward bonds through the use of auction rate securities All of these strategies can be appropriate but only in moderation and with the investor s complete understanding of what s at stake and how it works Tyler noted that for an investor who suffered big losses in auction rate securities bond issues that saw a calamitous price drop because they lost most or all of their bidders during the credit crunch knowing that the securities are legitimate is not much of a panacea The consumer can t necessarily access their money and the damage is real in terms of how it diminishes assets so while there is hope for a bounce back in the securities I don t think someone necessarily feels better about their loss because it came from a legitimate investment instead of a scam Tyler said Ultimately avoiding the scams and traps means approaching the situation rationally and dedicated to the process of acquiring full knowledge before buying an investment Part of the global issue of compromised confidence that we re seeing right now is that people feel like they have to make a change and do something different Tyler said There are so many significant challenges being faced by investors that indeed they are more vulnerable to acting on that desire to do something and be taken in Instead of making wholesale changes jumping to new advisers newfangled investment ideas or the next purported guru Tyler said investors should revisit the reasons why they made their investments in the first place It s not that making change is wrong it s more that they probably made those first choices carefully and want to be equally careful and maybe more careful before changing things now,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Summertime, and the scamming is easy.

Weâ€™ve mentioned before that about 40% of middle-class Americans will live close to or in poverty by the time they reach age 65.

306,While investing in postsecondary education continues to yield on average positive and substantial returns burdensome student loan debt levels may be lessening these benefits the researchers conclude As policymakers evaluate ways to aid student borrowers they may wish to consider policies that reduce the cost of tuition such as greater state government investment in public institutions From to the share of American families of all ages with an outstanding student loan balance rose from percent to percent according to the Fed s Survey of Consumer Finances The median family with student loan debt now owes on those loans according to the survey up from a median balance of just in dollars in While the Fed s latest report focuses on young families those headed by older adults are also experiencing rising student loan burdens Thirty four percent of families headed by someone between and have outstanding student loan balances as do percent of families headed by people in their s and s Student loan indebtedness is now just as prevalent among these middle aged Americans percent as it was among to yearolds percent in If those trends continue in just a few years people with student loan debt will account for a majority of households headed by someone under the age of And as that generation continues to age many will carry their debt with them some well into retirement The Fed s researchers say they ll be looking at the effect of student loan debt not just on homeownership but on access to credit overall Preliminary data shows that higher student loan debt early in life leads to a lower credit score later in life which has implications well beyond homeownership Data compiled by the American Enterprise Institute shows the proximate cause of skyrocketing student loan debt The cost of higher education has risen much faster than the cost of just about everything else The price of college tuition has risen by percent since more than three times faster than overall inflation since then One reason for rising college costs is that state policymakers have slashed funding for higher education in recent decades In states taxpayers spend more on jails and prisons than they do on colleges and universities according to a Department of Education report Overall the return on investment to higher education remains quite good A person with a bachelor s degree can expect to earn about half a million dollars more over their lifetime than a similarly situated individual with only a high school diploma according to a report by the Social Security Administration But the rising price of tuition is gnawing away at that earnings advantage The Fed s report shows that a rising debt load makes it harder for young Americans to buy a home some previous generations took for granted,"Skyrocketing student loan debt put homeownership out of reach for 400,000 Americans in their 20s and 30s from 2005 to 2014, according to a new report from the Federal Reserve.

Meanwhile, trade jobs are underfilled as high school students are pushed toward a four-year college path, potentially doomed to deal with student debt for decades. Ameritech Financial, a document preparation company that helps federal student loan borrowers with federal repayment plan applications, recommends that young adults who struggle with higher education debt look into income-driven repayment plans (IDRs).

""There is a big push these days toward trade jobs as the student debt crisis grows,"" said Tom Knickerbocker, executive vice president of Ameritech Financial. ""Students have been told that the key to success is a college education and that loans will help them achieve that. But student loan horror stories might be changing the conversation.""",1,

An auto insurer's innovative taxi service for seniors has sputtered to
a slow start in Orlando.



San Antonio-based USAA attracted the attention of transportation
experts nationwide earlier this year when it announced plans for Choice
Ride, a trial program in which people over age 65 give up driving in
exchange for a 90% discount on auto insurance. Seniors pay about $1,000
in advance for every 30 round trips in a USAA-provided limo; to receive
the discount, they must agree to drive only in emergencies.

314,The following is a press release from S P Global Ratings OVERVIEW We reviewed four PHEAA Student Loan Trust transactions issued in and We affirmed our ratings on four classes of notes from the four transactions The affirmations reflect our view of the transactions credit enhancement levels collateral profiles available liquidity and payment structures as well as our view that each transaction has sufficient liquidity to cover interest payments to the notes over the next several months despite the impact of the COVID pandemic NEW YORK S P Global Ratings Jan S P Global Ratings today affirmed its AA sf ratings on the class A notes from PHEAA Student Loan Trust and Each transaction is backed by a pool of student loans originated through the U S Department of Education s ED Federal Family Education Loan Program FFELP Our review considered the transactions collateral performance available liquidity changes in credit enhancement and capital and payment structures We also considered the evolving macroeconomic environment that has resulted from the COVID pandemic which will likely present employment challenges for student loan borrowers Additionally we considered secondary credit factors such as credit stability peer comparisons and issuer specific analyses As vaccine rollouts in several countries continue S P Global Ratings believes there remains a high degree of uncertainty about the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects Widespread immunization which certain countries might achieve by midyear will help pave the way for a return to more normal levels of social and economic activity We use this assumption about vaccine timing in assessing the economic and credit implications associated with the pandemic see our research at www spglobal com ratings As the situation evolves we will update our assumptions and estimates accordingly COVID IMPACT ON FFELP PORTFOLIO Although the levels of default for the loans in FFELP transactions may increase due to the COVID pandemic we expect the loans to maintain their guarantee from ED and for net losses to remain low S P Global Ratings affirmed its rating on the U S sovereign at AA Stable A on April Generally all of the borrowers loan payments interest and principal and the amounts received from ED are made available each period for the transactions waterfalls Typically FFELP transactions waterfalls first pay senior fees and expenses and then pay bond interest payments After bond interest payments are made the remaining available amounts are primarily used to make bond principal payments and in the case of certain transactions to make releases Effectively bond principal payments and releases are excess liquidity that is available if needed for bond interest payments in the short term A review of recent servicer reports for all of the transactions in our FFELP portfolio shows that generally bond interest payments make up no more than and on average of the total payments to bondholders As a result of the COVID pandemic we believe that FFELP transactions will be affected by higher levels of forbearance and income driven repayment relief Generally we believe FFELP transactions could withstand such temporary material declines in borrower payment levels and still make full and timely note interest payments We expect the decline in borrower payment levels will have a greater impact on the ability to repay principal by the legal final maturity date Classes with less time to maturity will be negatively affected to a greater degree than those with more time to maturity RATINGS RATIONALE We rely on the long term sovereign rating on the U S government AA in our analysis of defaulted loan reimbursements under the federally reinsured guarantee as well as ED interest subsidies and special allowance payments on the FFELP loans When the U S sovereign rating is AA our criteria require that for notes rated higher than the U S i e AAA rated notes payments backed by the U S government receive a haircut Based on our review of similar transactions backed by FFELP loans we generally believe a parity for releasing structures is commensurate with a AAA rating The class A notes parity ratio for each of the four PHEAA transactions is below Therefore we affirmed our ratings on these notes at AA sf Generally we calculate parity as the sum of the pool balance as of the end of the collection period and the reserve account over the relevant note balance as of the end of the distribution date CURRENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE All of the transactions in this review comprise one senior and one subordinate class with coupons based on a spread above a LIBOR index The subordinate classes are not rated PAYMENT STRUCTURE AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT These transactions utilize a payment mechanism that defines a principal distribution amount to be distributed to the noteholders to achieve an overcollateralization target Generally once the overcollateralization target is reached available funds can be used to pay subordinated payments and then released out of the trust The target overcollateralization is non amortizing and thus provides a floor amount of credit support to the notes which is especially important during the transaction s later stages As a result overcollateralization should build and senior and total parity should grow as the loan pool amortizes Credit enhancement includes overcollateralization parity subordination for the senior classes the reserve account and excess spread COLLATERAL These transactions primarily comprise Stafford Consolidation and Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student loans that are supported by a guarantee from ED of at least of a defaulted loan s principal and interest Loans that have been serviced according to the FFELP guidelines are supported by this guarantee therefore net losses are expected to be minimal LIQUIDITY Based on the historical principal paydown of the notes and the expected impact of higher forbearance and IBR levels due to the COVID pandemic we expect that these notes will be repaid before their respective legal final maturity dates In our analysis a principal payment haircut is used to determine if the note is sensitive to the pace of principal payments This haircut illustrates the immediate potential percentage decrease in principal payments that would still result in full principal repayments by the legal final maturity date The notes in the transactions reviewed have haircuts above based on historical average principal payments over the past year We will continue to monitor the performance of the student loan receivables backing the transactions relative to our ratings and the available credit enhancement and liquidity for the notes RELATED

319,In Sterling s case his alleged girlfriend taped a phone conversation between them without his knowledge While the recording was used by the NBA in rendering the lifetime ban could the recording be used for evidentiary purposes in a legal proceeding While I cannot speak in detail about California law it is a two party consent state In other words every person who participates in the discussion must agree to be taped in order for it to have legally occurred How about in New Jersey Well New Jersey is a whole different story Known as a one party consent state only one person involved in the discussion needs to consent to the recording being made In other words only the person who is doing the actual recording needs to be okay with it which essentially goes without saying As a result many of our cases involve litigants who recorded the other party without that party s knowledge saying something that can potentially be used as evidence in the divorce proceeding Perhaps the recording revealed that the other spouse is working despite claims that she is a stay at home mother without any income or perhaps it reveals that she hid assets after having claimed full disclosure on her Case Information Statement From a custody and parenting time standpoint perhaps the recording reveals that he is still drinking excessively despite claims that he never drinks at all or finished his rehab program to completion or he admits to striking the child despite answering otherwise in his answers to interrogatories or when testifying during a deposition Like with the perils of social media the possibilities of what may show up on a recording are truly endless Depending on a given set of facts and circumstances it may be advisable for a party to procure a recording device and use it when speaking with the other litigant For one thing it could prove to be very useful should the other spouse ever make a false claim of domestic violence A recording of what truly transpired can be extremely valuable whether the allegations are true or not In other instances you never know what the other party may say that could be useful on any issue including those I list above On the other hand if the recorder is used in a certain way perhaps left in the other party s bedroom recording for days on end it could potentially constitute a form of domestic violence in and of itself should the other spouse discover the device Thus there are risks depending on how the recording is made If you are not recording the other party always be aware that you may be recorded Everything you say and everything you do may be on tape and may eventually be used against you in your divorce post divorce or custody proceeding Ultimately the Sterling recording led to the ban The fact that the recording was of a private phone conversation shows just how damning the content thereof could potentially be Family law litigants in New Jersey which requires the consent of only one party to make such a recording should be cognizant of both sides of the coin when conducting themselves with the other party The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances Mr Robert Epstein Fox Rothschild LLP Market Street th Floor Philadelphia PA UNITED STATES Tel Fax E mail communications foxrothschild com URL www foxrothschild com Click Here for related articles c Mondaq Ltd Tel http www mondaq com,"Unless you have been living under a rock in recent days, you have heard about Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, his race-based comments recorded by his girlfriend, and how his comments led to his lifetime ban from any and all NBA related activities.Â  While I am not going to use this blog as an opportunity to discuss what happened (read the firm's Sports Law Scoreboard Blog for that), it isÂ how theÂ infamous recordingÂ that led to thisÂ troubled man's downfall connects with our world of divorce that is worth discussion.Â  Indeed, I have blogged on many prior occasions about the dangers of using social media in divorce, but what about a situation where you are tape recorded without your knowledge?",0,

The idea is to find a big winner in the market, which (due to its success) is generally a very large company. Then, one looks for a much smaller company within the same industry. The 'baby brother'might be growing fast too, or, it might even become an acquisition target of the larger company.",0,
322,Certainly few of us need to ask whether the plans matter Americans now hold trillion in k s and similar defined contribution plans nearly three times as much as the trillion parked in annuities The plans weren t originally designed to be the nation s primary retirement lifeline they started as a minor tax perk for senior executives but they ve grown inexorably as ever more big companies have abandoned traditional pensions Only about a third of the corporate workforce can look forward to a monthly pension check today down from three decades ago Over the same period assets in k like plans have grown fold And yet as many economists and money pros know and as more employees are beginning to realize k plans are riddled with problems capable of tripping up even the most diligent investors The laundry list of pitfalls includes high and often hidden expenses as well as company provided advice that critics say ranges from vague to nonexistent And perhaps most frustrating many employees have little say over the investment options in the plan lineup meaning that picking the components of their k may be the biggest financial decision they never get to make For many investors the answer has been to adopt what amounts to a k plus strategy They re opening up separate accounts where they get investment options that their plans lack and seeking advice from outside financial planners As Seattle planner Lowell Lombardini Parker puts it Use what you can But if you have to go outside the k Expanding Your Choices During the financial crisis of many Main Street investors began searching for the first time for commodities foreign bonds and other alternative investments that could stay afloat when U S stocks sank But if they went looking in their k s advisers say chances are they found nothing and even now many plans haven t adapted Excluding target date products the average plan has just funds only one more than before the market crash according to human resources consultants Aon Hewitt The very categories the plans are missing are often the ones that employees could use to hedge their portfolios against a choppy stock market Less than half of plans have a bond index fund for example and only about one in four includes real estate funds The upshot is that some employees have decided in a sense to take the money and run setting up separate retirement accounts that can fill the holes in their k s The plan at aircraft giant Boeing for example has many things going for it including low fees and plenty of low cost index funds But it lacks some funds that focus on assets that can thrive in rocky markets including real estate investment trusts and Treasury inflation protected securities In response to this shortage many Boeing employees have built their own shadow k s Mr Lombardini Parker says he has dealt with dozens of clients from the company helping them buy low cost funds targeting those asset classes Boeing says its own plan includes a prudent menu designed to avoid overwhelming unsophisticated investors The shadow k strategy isn t necessarily the right fit for everyone Because a matching contribution from an employer is essentially free money planners say investors should always collect fully on that And higherincome workers may not be able to make tax deductible contributions to outside accounts if they also have a k Investors frustrated with their plans can also always approach the boss Retirement consultants say employers no less befuddled by the system are often happy to hear employee requests about say adding funds to a plan Bring In Reinforcements At about of k plans employees have access to investment advice But according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America a trade group only about one in five eligible investors takes advantage of the offer Why so little interest David Wray president of the plan council says the threat of lawsuits means large companies need to make sure investors in similar life situations get consistent recommendations which means the advice is less likely to be personalized Employers also almost always avoid offering advice about any assets that aren t in the k like a home or a spouse s savings The result Plan provided advice tends to be generic says Mr Wray The problem is that advice that isn t generic can get expensive Financial advisers can spend hours poring over every investment choice But their fees often start at of an investor s assets One Goldilocks option Some financial planners will counsel investors on a onetime basis for an hourly fee Brian Terry a Charlotte N C based adviser has seen dozens of k clients He gives his clients a rundown of their plan taking a few hours to help them pick investments many but not all return once a year for a follow up His price an hour Financial planners can have their own idiosyncrasies and agendas of course and if planners offer advice about investments outside the k investors should ask whether they get compensated for recommending any particular products When it s time to talk k preparation counts Think carefully about when you want to retire and how much money you hope to spend says Lea Ann Knight a planner from Bedford Mass who meets with many clients for similar consultations And don t be shy about secret ambitions like that condo in Maui Devote your face time with the planner to these goals says Ms Knight

323,So call us and we ll talk whether things are going well or whether they aren t I ve got an opinion I can tell you that I m an expert on my opinion The phone number is Or you can go online at daveramsey com You can click on Dave s e mail Please keep those brief and to the point And we ll do our best to answer them as a part of the show this evening So thanks for joining us All right let s go to Dee Dee Dee Dee is in Indianapolis to kick the evening off How are you Dee Dee CALLER Hi Dave Thanks for taking my call RAMSEY Sure CALLER Really appreciate some wise counsel RAMSEY Well give it a shot What s up CALLER A lot And I ll try to be brief A former widow married a man had medical malpractice suit from my deceased husband Put it in some annuities some IRAs The children got theirs Long story short the marriage is not going well We re currently separated I paid off his charges three or four times paid all the taxes estimated we re both in commission sales He came home two years ago and wanted another grand in charge cards that s in my name promising that this would be our future He s in real estate On a scale of to on stupidity or naivete Dave I don t know but I signed and I did it Okay So that is that part of it In the meantime had a daughter that was a drug addict used her funds to get her through rehab and on her own out of her annuities I did not use legal counsel I did it on my own So bottom line now is my daughter s hired an attorney to threaten me or to take me to court for the annuity money that I spent on her And my husband and I kicked out of the house back in April That switch that you talk about it flipped when he said he was going to come claim bankruptcy He wanted me to claim bankruptcy I said no this is my house in my name first and second mortgage And we kind of argued about it And a few days later a man came to shut off our heat So I called him in the office and said you are out I am tired of this stuff I ve invested in his business I ve done what I thought I should And I told him the money tree the giving tree and the loving tree is all gone Now what So I get to an attorney She said claim bankruptcy And I did RAMSEY The annuities are all drained CALLER I m sorry RAMSEY The annuities are all drained CALLER No what they did was they asked for the declaration page So that s where I am right now That was about five six weeks ago And the IRAs are going to be fine but the trustee asked for the declaration page to the annuities RAMSEY Uh huh CALLER So I m in a quagmire Not really sure RAMSEY So how much is in these annuity CALLER It pays out over years about grand a month starting in until death or years whatever RAMSEY Okay That money s gone All right are you making a living CALLER I m in commission sales I can do better You know I m going to have RAMSEY Can you make a living Can you eat CALLER Yeah I m doing OK I m doing all right I m selling RAMSEY Have you hired an attorney to sue your drug addict daughter back right CALLER No she s out and she s doing fine now RAMSEY No she s not Anybody that would sue their mother for getting them help is not doing fine by definition So I guess you know you re going to have to mount legal or just throw her threats of lawsuits and the bankruptcy I guess CALLER That s what the attorney did RAMSEY Okay CALLER So RAMSEY Any claims resulting from that would be CALLER Correct RAMSEY in the bankruptcy So that shuts her down Okay that works CALLER Yeah Well and I ve been excommunicated from the family No contact with them or any of my grandchildren RAMSEY Well of course CALLER Bit family It s just it s horrible RAMSEY Because you won t pay her back money that kept her from dying of drug addiction CALLER I ve got the receipts RAMSEY I know CALLER I ve given them the receipts but it s still you know it s family RAMSEY Okay so how can I best help you tonight CALLER I don t know which end is up I don t know what to do first I m going to l be in this house for a while The attorney said that you know you ve got six to nine months RAMSEY Yeah Basically rent free because you re not going to pay payments CALLER Right RAMSEY And it ll take them that long to take it Okay CALLER Right RAMSEY So well you ve got a pile of cash to start And we start with the basics We start with food shelter clothing transportation and utilities Any children at home CALLER No RAMSEY Okay CALLER One in college and the four others are out on their own RAMSEY Okay So it s pretty simple You just got to take care of you Food shelter clothing transportation and utilities And we take care of those things And from there then we rebuild CALLER I did the baby steps and I ve got in savings RAMSEY Good good And all the debts are in the bankruptcy So that s taken care of unless you ve got taxes or you have taxes outstanding CALLER Yeah that was part of the problem I paid the taxes for the first six years of our marriage And then it was his turn And he said he was And then he didn t So the IRS seized all my bank accounts at one time and left me one cent Aren t they nice One cent I mean RAMSEY Married filing jointly you know if you were not aware of what s going on it s a possibility you can qualify for innocent spouse provision You should ask a CPA about that But the only debts that ll survive bankruptcy would be typically something having to do with fraud which we don t have in this case Taxes would survive and child support those kinds student loans will survive a bankruptcy So if you ve got any of those things that s your baby step And then you move on to baby step number three which is build your emergency fund And you just begin to rebuild your life in the midst of all this emotion and drama that is your life right now And you know it s difficult thing to wade through that much stuff And you re wading through a bunch of it No question about it And you now if I were in your shoes if you were my little sister I would tell you to spend some time with a good counselor just because you ve been hit by people that you love so hard so many different ways that you ve got some pretty deep wounds That doesn t make you a bad person It just means you got hit You were in a car wreck emotionally And you know you got a broken leg a broken arm You got a head you know a cut on your head whatever Whatever metaphor you want to use for this And it d just be very wise for you to spend some time unpacking all of these things that have happened and you know picking up what your part of it is and laying down the rest of it and getting some peace about it and some forgiveness and moving on And you know there s a lot of stuff flying around in your life there that is obvious in just talking to you And it s not a bad thing I just would say it s a good thing to unpack that and you know reach some spiritual conclusions some emotional conclusions about some of this so you can put a bow on it move to the next stage of your life You ve had a lot of different things happen to you Thanks for the call All right Jennifer is next in Columbus Ohio Hi Jennifer welcome to The Dave Ramsey Show CALLER Hello Dave It s an honor to talk to you sir RAMSEY You too What s up CALLER Well just feeling a little stuck between a couple issues and looking for some advice on getting together a game plan RAMSEY Okay CALLER In summary I m the youngest of four kids My father has passed away and so did my oldest sister Most of the family responsibilities have come down to me The other two siblings just aren t really involved at for varying reasons I m trying to advise my mother financially And I m really not sure what the best options are for her at this point I ve been doing this for a few years now And now I m just kind of feeling a little stuck RAMSEY Is she following your advice CALLER She asks me and then does whatever she wants LAUGHTER RAMSEY That sounds normal Okay CALLER She s only in her early s And her family tends to live a long time eighties nineties hundred So even though she s in her s I m still thinking about her future RAMSEY That s a good thing CALLER And I just don t think she s making very good decisions She s wasting a lot of money I m trying to secure things But on the other hand I can t I don t want to insult here And I don t want to feel like I m taking over and she has no choice in her life RAMSEY Okay CALLER Her big thing is she does not want money to be tied up and inaccessible to her RAMSEY Okay CALLER I would love it to be RAMSEY Okay CALLER You know RAMSEY Because why What does she do with it that s irresponsible CALLER Mostly gambling RAMSEY Oh OK CALLER Or just RAMSEY And so how much money does she have CALLER Well I m not absolutely positive anymore RAMSEY Roughly CALLER I would guess about left RAMSEY To her name CALLER Yes RAMSEY Oh CALLER The house is paid off RAMSEY Yeah this is a broke person that doesn t need gambling in their life at all Okay CALLER I agree RAMSEY Wow CALLER I agree RAMSEY Well here s the deal I mean CALLER I ve been trying RAMSEY you know the first thing you got to establish is obviously she can t do that Obviously you there s not a legal mechanism that allows you to make her be smart unless you have her declared mentally incompetent And she s not mentally incompetent CALLER No not at all RAMSEY So you couldn t have her have that happen And so gambling s not illegal It s stupid but it s not illegal And you know lots of broke people do it And they re going to continue to be broke people And you know it s going to come down to you re probably going to end up having to pay her groceries because she gambles this money away And but before you know before you give her any money ever you re going to be then you have the right to say with this money comes strings You re not allowed to do this anymore You re not going to do any of this with this money And you know I really wouldn t give her any money if she s gambling at years old CALLER No RAMSEY I would just buy things like groceries or pay her light bill or whatever If you ve got the ability CALLER She s doing OK with living expenses It s just the savings that I m concerned with RAMSEY She has no money though CALLER Not really no RAMSEY I mean what is she living off of Social Insecurity CALLER Social Security and pension RAMSEY Yeah how big is her pension CALLER I think combined she brings in about a month RAMSEY Between the two Yeah So she can eat on that with a paid for house and then gamble away the other and still survive CALLER Right RAMSEY You know but you know there s not really a lot you can do to make somebody that you love that s misbehaving suddenly behave All you can do is just be there And you know if they ask you can say But as you said was classic you know I tell her what I think she should do then she goes and does what she wants to do And you know folks are just that way Adults are that way They have the legal right to go do stupid things Stupid s not yet illegal Thank goodness we d all be in jail for something we ve at some time or another in our lives So I think it s just you know you re the only one that cares And you re having to watch someone that you love hurt themselves And that s a hard thing to do And I think I would just say that out loud and then step back and smile and love her and watch it We ll be right back with more of your calls The phone number s This is The Dave Ramsey Show on the FOX Business Network COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CALLER Hi Dave My name is Ahmed I was going to ask you what s the best way to teach my kids about investing END VIDEO CLIP RAMSEY Great question Well it depends on the age of course Once they can do basic multiplication and grasp the idea where could look at share price and a mutual fund versus times the number of shares that you own equals the total dollar value in there and then you can begin to you know share with them what their mutual fund looks like if you ve got a mutual fund For instance our kids we had college funds in their mutual funds And so they could watch their college fund And then when we you know there d be something on the TV that night or the television of the stock market going up or down then we d sit down and look at that and maybe go online and look say this is what happened to the mutual fund But we don t worry about that We ride it out up or down We have a long term perspective That s the definition of investing And you don t want to do a bunch of stuff where like they play with single stocks because then that teaches them to buy and sell single stocks which is a bad idea The track record of people who mess around with that is not very good Most people don t do very well doing that Everybody thinks they do They ve got that it s like phishing stories They ve all got that one that was a big catch but then they forget about all those days they went and caught nothing or they lost everything That kind of a thing So you know investing honestly is pretty boring because you just kind of buy and four get it Once you ve gotten a good mutual fund picked out But you can walk them through and show them some of the math things and create some teachable moments have some discussions And that ll help you to begin doing that But I wouldn t do anything too sophisticated too fancy because then that teaches them that this has to be complicated It s really not Okay let s go next to Frank Frank is in Winston Salem Hi Frank how are you tonight CALLER I m good How are you on this evening RAMSEY Better than I deserve sir How can I help CALLER I heard you on our local channel here in the morning You had a marriage counselor in there talking And I was tried to call in that day and couldn t get through So I called in this evening And me and my wife been having some problems for about well we ve been married for seven years And it s been going on seven years To make a long story short she s had two affairs And we ve got a child together that is six years old And I ve got two children from a previous marriage And she won t let me see them She s tried everything she can do to get them out of my life And I don t know what you do We split up and got back together and split up and got back together And she s fine for a month or so and then goes back to the same old not wanting my other kids RAMSEY So why does she not want them around CALLER The only thing I can figure is jealousy There s no I don t show any more attention to them than I do you know our daughter And I don t know She don t give me an honest reason She just says they re not my kids I don t want to them here RAMSEY Uh huh OK Well CALLER We ve been to marriage counselors We ve been we ve talked to a preacher RAMSEY And what do they say to her CALLER You know they re his kids You knew he had them before you all were married You know he needs to be a part of their lives you know just like he needs to be a part of you know our child s life RAMSEY Well Frank I m just a guy I m not a marriage counselor I ve been married years And so I don t have any you know great marriage counseling insight to give you I mean at some point she s going to have to decide that she values you and your marriage more than her jealousy of these kids because it is not reasonable for you to disown your children because this lady who obviously has emotional issues can t get her act together CALLER Right RAMSEY And so the only thing I know how tell you is sometimes you know you ve obviously said all you can say to her I don t have anything to tell you to say to her but sometimes the light comes on if you ll continue to be involved in the congregation You said preacher Be involved in your local church Some other ladies being around her some other friends being around here There s some modeling going on of people doing marriage right around you And maybe that rubs off on her some I know it s rubbed off on me some I ve watched guys that were better husbands teach me by their example to be a better husband you know And so that s a kind of thing that might help her And of course I think I would continue to invest in sitting down with some kind of a counselor whether it s your pastor preacher you know a professional marriage counselor any of that s fine with me But it s obvious that you guys are going to have to invest in that because you can t just sit where you are Where you are stinks You know she s being a jerk about the kids You re freaked out about that And this has got to stop And so it s not going to lead you to good places And you re not going to abandon your children You d be crazy to You d be the wrong kind of guy to do that So I think you got to continue to have input into your marriage and you re your relationship from other people And that s good friends and that church type of a setting And that s you know some good counsel And continue to do that And then you know maybe one of these days that information will get through And you ll see a change of heart for her I sure hope so We ll be right back with more of your e mails and calls Our phone number s You re watching The Dave Ramsey Show on the FOX Business Network COMMERCIAL BREAK RAMSEY Tonight s did you know percent of teens say they have never discussed using credit cards responsibly with their parents Well that s interesting Seven out of teens have not had a discussion about a credit card with their parents And yet it is the number one cause of bankruptcy among young adults So you parents are horrible That s your parenting I mean what is your deal using credit cards responsibly Maybe you could have a discussion like never use them That s a good way to never have one that s a good way to use them responsibly Kim is on the line Kim s in Salt Lake City Hi Kim welcome to The Dave Ramsey Show CALLER Hi Dave RAMSEY Hey what s up CALLER First of all thanks for taking my call RAMSEY Sure CALLER And I ve got some mortgage questions for you And I ll give you a little history I m a disabled widow I m waiting for an insurance policy to pay off and but that could be I don t know when RAMSEY A life insurance or disability policy CALLER Life insurance policy RAMSEY When did your husband pass CALLER He passed November S it s been we ve been fighting the battle RAMSEY Why are they not paying out on it CALLER They re saying that it was due to drugs and alcohol And it was a classic pulmonary embolism So I ve had to go to get an attorney and go to court on it RAMSEY Drugs and alcohol are not a reason not to pay out on a typical life insurance policy What kind of a policy was this CALLER I was accidental death policy RAMSEY Oh Okay CALLER That s why RAMSEY Okay CALLER But my biggest question is I m four months behind on my mortgage I ve been working with the mitigation department And I ve found people have been calling me telling me that I can restructure my loan And I m under the understanding that restructure his they don t mess with the time of the loan They renegotiate the interest rate of the loan And then they put all the RAMSEY Who is calling you I m sorry who s calling you your mortgage company CALLER No I put I tried to file some stuff with the mitigation department online And I guess I inadvertently got on a Web site so I ve had like five or six different companies call me RAMSEY Oh you stay completely away from CALLER About his restructure RAMSEY You stay completely away from those people It s a total scam CALLER And I m well what I m having a hard time finding somebody to help me restructure this loan without them charging me to RAMSEY They re going to charge you to And they re going do nothing CALLER Right RAMSEY Don t do any of that ever The only person that can restructure your loan is your mortgage company Are you talking to them CALLER I have been And but it is really hard to get ahold of them And I m really worried about them sending me a letter of foreclosure RAMSEY Well I think they re probably going to You re four months behind CALLER Right RAMSEY And so if you don t get it restructured so why are you behind CALLER I just ran out of funds RAMSEY Okay CALLER I ve used all of the money that you know RAMSEY So what do you make a year What is your disability income CALLER My disability I m getting a month RAMSEY Okay And how much other money do you have nothing else CALLER Not anymore I ve used all if the you know inheritance money for the home RAMSEY What s the home worth CALLER It s worth I owe on it And it s on a year at percent RAMSEY Okay You re not going to like my answer Let me tell you up front CALLER Okay RAMSEY But it s the best thing for you to do anyway If I woke up in your shoes I would not be waiting around on this life insurance policy to make your life OK because you may never get that money I hope you do but it might not come in time to save this house And you have to much equity in this house to lose it And the chances of them rewriting this loan to where you can pay the payment on a sign income is zero They do not have a program that s going to drop your payment to per month CALLER Right RAMSEY And that s what it s got to be or a month for you to live on a month right CALLER Right RAMSEY And so you can t afford this house darling CALLER Well I was looking at doing a quick sale And the bottom line is I d end up coming out with or RAMSEY Yeah I don t know that I have to do a quick sale I think I d get a realtor Get the thing on the market Try to get it sold in the next to days They re not going take the house in minutes CALLER Right RAMSEY If they start a foreclosure it will take them several months from now to do that You probably have two or three months minimum Maybe six months before the actual foreclosure sale occurs RAMSEY And so in most states it takes days or more from the time they actually named the date of the foreclosure sale and they re a long ways from doing that They will not do that until you are about six months behind on a traditional mortgage What s your interest rate CALLER RAMSEY Okay you re on traditional mortgage an FHI a VA or a Fannie Mae And they re not going to take you to foreclosure sooner than six months You re only four months behind So we ve got at least days to get this house sold Okay So I m going to put a sign in the yard this week And I m going to try to sell it And then you can walk out with a traditional sale you know with maybe here Right CALLER Right RAMSEY And then I m going to go buy a little inexpensive nice condo that s safe that you have zero payments on And then that will give you the ability to live off on per month Then if the insurance money comes in and how much money is that on that accidental death CALLER It s and then you know the lawyer s going to take a chunk RAMSEY Yeah Then I would take that balance that s not enough to make you move back INAUDIBLE I would take that money and invest it to have a little bit more income to go with your And of course depending on the nature of your disability if there s something that you can do to earn some other income that s going to be advisable too because a month s going to be tough to make it on for a lot of years And that s really what you re facing And so I would get this thing up for sale before it gets any further behind You can continue to work with them directly with your mortgage company to the extent they ll work with you about restructuring the loan but there s really not a restructure mathematically that is going to make mortgage fit in a per month income You know the thing is just RAMSEY Bad body said sad story And so I m going to go ahead and sell this house while I ve still have time to not have to give it away And come out of there with enough to buy you a little condo or something cash that you can be safe in and is paid for that you never lose that what Great question Sorry you re facing this darling All right more of your calls and e mails right after the break Send me your questions at Daveonair Daveramsey com This is The Dave Ramsey Show on the FOX Business Network COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CALLER Hi Dave My name is Rachel I have been with Citibank over years I just got a letter that they re going to raise my fees Do you think I should look for another bank or try to challenge them I didn t see any reason for doing it END VIDEO CLIP RAMSEY You know when do you reach the point I m mad as hell and I m not going to take it anymore I mean when do you reach that point with these banks They just mistreat and you just stay with them Why If you keep going to a restaurant for its lousy service how do you complain about the food You don t You leave them They re morons They mistreat their customers You re one of them I don t know why you re one of them Leave Go to a great little community bank who actually care that you re there Go to a credit union who will actually care that you re there And then if they raise the fees you can actually get to talk to a human who might discuss it with you You don t get a letter in the mail Oh my goodness See this is the deal People somehow feel I have been with them years Well years ago they were a different company Somewhere during that years they lost their soul You know You just can t You just can t stay and continue to do business with people who mistreat you This isn t hard to figure out Mark is on the line in Chicago Illinois Hey Mark Welcome to THE DAVE RAMSEY SHOW And how are you tonight CALLER Hey Dave Thanks for taking my call RAMSEY Sure CALLER I am doing good RAMSEY Good What s up CALLER A quick question to your point You know I have some extra cash I guess I m wondering is it wise to try to pay off my mortgage after a lot of different things as soon as possible Or is it better off to put that money toward some other resource You know my wife and I both work I think we make a good income for our age I really don t know how to judge it if it s good or bad RAMSEY What s your income CALLER I think combined we re about we re right at RAMSEY Mm hmm Well you re in the top one half of percent of Americans regardless of their age So that would be called pretty good LAUGHTER CALLER OK OK Like I said I m pretty modest I don t know how to judge it RAMSEY You re killing it dude That s how I m judging it So how much you have any debt except you house CALLER You know I have a small credit card debt not much A small student loan RAMSEY OK First thing I ll do is pay those two off CALLER OK RAMSEY I ll just clean up the house there You got a little mess Clean up the house get organized And then you need to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses In your place that s to CALLER Right Yes I mean I CROSSTALK RAMSEY They re just for emergencies Never to be touched CALLER Yes Right I probably got a bit RAMSEY OK CALLER You know I wouldn t say six months but I probably got four four and a half months RAMSEY OK Well you re in good shape then as long as you don t touch it CALLER No Right That s the do not touch fund RAMSEY Yes That s the operable thing This is not really an investment This is just in case of emergency In case Murphy knocks at the door and we can t answer the question Then the next thing I would do is make sure you re putting percent of your income into retirement Are you investing a year about a month CALLER Yes I hit the IRS limit on my k plan Annually RAMSEY All right And what about your wife CALLER My wife she puts the maximum that her company her organization lets her put RAMSEY Does that amount to a year total CALLER Um I don t believe so because RAMSEY I don t think so either CALLER Yes RAMSEY So you need to look at how you can do some investing to get you to a total of percent of your household income which would be about a year Do you have children CALLER Yes I have two small boys RAMSEY OK Do you have any college savings done CALLER Yes we have it s one of those can t think of a name It s not a some of those college funds those very INAUDIBLE fund that came out through RAMSEY s CALLER Yes through s RAMSEY Is it a prepaid college CALLER No it s not a prepaid college It s more like an annuity I believe I don t know if I m doing the right thing for that either RAMSEY I would have that in good mutual funds and let that be your college fund Annuities I m not real thrilled with just because of the extra fees And I wanted something that s gong to pay well so we re going to do retirement OK we re going to have no debt except the house We re going to have an emergency fund We re going to do retirement Do the kids college I m walking through what we call are the baby steps Mark and baby step number six is the next one after college and that s pay off the house early And then the answer is after I m doing these other things yes I would be paying off the house early as fast as I could because if you have a pay for a house would you go borrow on it in order to investing The answer is no CALLER Right RAMSEY And that s the same question I m just asking it backwards CALLER Exactly because that would be you know that was the other thing So how much I mean the boys are young They re years old How much should I be saving or trying to invest monthly for a college type of program that s not you know a month a month I you know or as much as I can RAMSEY Well to cover their undergrad in an in state college probably a month will take care of you pretty easily CALLER OK RAMSEY If you want to go fancier than in state college tuition and you want to do more than just undergrad then you re going to need to save more than a month each but that will take good care of you there You re right on track on that So I ll be doing that I ll make sure I had a year going into retirement and everything else I can squeeze out I m going to start throwing at the house and pay it off as fast as I possibly can then the last up is with the house paid off there s nothing left to do then but to become very wealthy and give a bunch of it away All right Question coming in on Twitter now After going through FPU I m committed to launching my photography business without debt Good But I m overwhelmed by all the start up costs Any suggestions Yes You only need to buy a camera Used And then after you have a couple of shoots with the camera and somebody pays you then you can buy a light and then once you shoot with that light and that camera and then you might buy another light Then once you shoot with that you might have another lens But you don t have to buy all of this stuff up front in order to be a photographer A photographer these days especially with digital the way it is has everything to do with your eye Look through the lens and see things I look at a lot of photographs We do a lot of print work a lot of things around here And I ll just tell you you can after you do that for a while I m not artist I m not a graphic artist but I can tell and looking at you know photographs who s got an eye that INAUDIB,,0,
E  and who is just taking a snapshot  And me  I take snapshots  I don t have an eye   But I can see other people that do  I can t frame it up  I don t know how to cause that same effect but you do  And that s the talent  It s not in the equipment  So grow your business  Make the profits  buy your equipment and you grow a little slower   Ann writes   I d like to know the best way to protect myself financially when the spouse will not quit spending and counseling is not an option   Why isn t counseling an option   Is there a way to separate financially and still stay married   No  Not well   For better or for worse divorce is not an option    I think you re in denial  darling  I think there s a lot of things that an option to your house that you re not willing to do  Counseling is an option  If your spouse won t go you go  And divorce is an option  I don t like divorce being an option  And I don t think it s the first option  I think it s the very last absolute worst option and I don t recommend divorce   I don t like divorce  I m not saying any of those things  But divorce is an option  And when you get pushed into a corner long enough you eventually will snap and your little futile explanation of your life of counseling is not an option  divorce is not option  so how can I live my life  It sucks this way where everything is separated and I can stay with this bozo who I hate   Well  that s a dumb way to live your life  That s ridiculous  So get in there and do the work  Fix this mess up and    to where you can heal the marriage and then you can start talking about combining the finances and doing this the right way  But no  there s not a way to do this half but life thing and make it work  It doesn t work   Lots more calls and e mails coming right up

    Don t go away  You re watching THE DAVE RAMSEY SHOW on the FOX Business Network    COMMERCIAL BREAK   RAMSEY  Tonight s  Myth vs  Truth   Myth  if I do a will  I might die  The truth is you re going to die  So do it with a will    LAUGHTER   It ain t funny  People really do say that  If I get a will  I m going to die  You re going to die  Nobody gets out of this deal alive  And so don t leave your family handcuffed and clueless about what s going on with the money stuff and with the estate   Well  I m not really out very much  Well  then don t spend a lot on the will  It s not very expensive to do a will  You can do a will for    or    bucks  Go to USLegalforms com ramsey and they run all kinds    or DaveRamsey  They run all kinds of specials there and    you know  you can get a state specific will from this online service  It s very  very straightforward and you know  get the thing done   But you want    always want your will to be state specific because probate law  the law that dictates how an estate is handled  is not federal law  It is done state by state and there are some differences  some nuances  from state to state  And of course  your will needs to be done specific to the state you re living in now  So if you ve moved  it s time to update that puppy   All right  Let s go to Detroit  Michigan  Anita is with us   Hi  Anita  How are you tonight   CALLER  I m good  Dave  Thanks for taking my call   RAMSEY  Sure  What s up   CALLER  Well  I want to give you a little bit of financial background  First of all  my husband and I are completely debt free and we own three properties  debt free as well  Two of those are rental properties  They do very well   RAMSEY  You guys are killing it   CALLER  You know what  I ve been doing DAVE RAMSEY even before I knew about DAVE RAMSEY  I ve been doing this budget thing for a long time   RAMSEY  You ve had common sense a long time    LAUGHTER   CALLER  Well  thank you  Anyways  my question is this  We re kind of on track for several goals here  One of them being our ultimate dream home and then what we wanted to do is we actually wanted to have another rental property and then also get my husband a newer vehicle because he has been driving a      Taurus for like six years and    so now we are at a point where we are deciding to do that   RAMSEY  Good   CALLER  And so he had wanted to maybe get a new vehicle for more money than what we originally were planning  I thought         would be fairly substantial for a used vehicle  And mine should we also have   RAMSEY  What car is he looking at   CALLER  Well  he was looking at some of those    Buick Enclave and things like that  So we need to stay away from that  but probably a vehicle in the         range  That was too much because we don t really want to go in debt for it   RAMSEY  Well  why would you be in debt  You ve got than           CALLER  Well   RAMSEY  You just don t want to spend it on a car   CALLER  Right  Right  Because we can t take it out of the bank and pays for it   RAMSEY  You sure can   CALLER  But we think that that would set us back further  So   RAMSEY  Further than what  Further than    why  Just to buy the next house   CALLER  Right   RAMSEY  OK so how much money is in the bank   CALLER  We have several years  salary  Do you want me to tell you specifically   RAMSEY  Yes  how much money   CALLER            RAMSEY  OK  Very good  Good for you  And how much is the current home worth   CALLER  Our current home  the values have gone down at        now they re probably    if we were get    to      we d probably be   RAMSEY  OK  let s say you have      And let s say you got a     in the bank  So that s      What is the price of the home you d like to move up to   CALLER  Probably     to      And we wanted to put    or    percent down   RAMSEY  So you were going to borrow money on the house   CALLER  If we bought a new one  yes   RAMSEY  OK  All right  And the rental properties are worth what   CALLER  The rental properties  the one that s right behind us  so it would probably go for    to      We got it for     And the other rental property is probably worth about    to     And they ve both been very productive  We ve had    one of them has been renting for like six years now and the other we ve just got and then rented   RAMSEY  What other wealth do you have   CALLER  We do have an IRA  And    not as much in the IRA   RAMSEY  OK  So            bucks or something   CALLER  Right around      RAMSEY  OK  All right  It sounds like your net worth is somewhere around six or           And you re completely debt free and your life is good  What is the income   CALLER  Combined       net  with the rental property and we save right    we probably save  oh gosh  usually    to    percent of that every month   RAMSEY  Wow  Well  I got to tell you  I think you guys are superstars  I don t recommend buying a new car unless you have    million net worth because a new car goes down in value so quickly   CALLER  Right   RAMSEY  I think the new car that he s looking at for    he can probably buy one year old for      CALLER  I see   RAMSEY  They go down that fast   CALLER  OK   RAMSEY  And so    certainly it s not going to bankrupt you if your write a         check and buy a car  It is going to slow down your ability to move up to that          house  obviously  or it s going to slow down you doing that and doing it debt free  which would always be my goal   I got to tell you  I think you guys are stars  It would be hard for Dave Ramsey  almost impossible for me  once I finally got out of debt to go back into debt  That would be really  really tough   And  you know  the freedom that you feel when you don t have any payments and you ve got         in the bank  And you got this great income coming and you re able to save like crazy  I just wouldn t be willing to sacrifice that for a different house or for a car   And so I m paying cash for whatever I do  That s how I live my life  So I m probably going to come down on your side on this car and limit it to    and slightly used  although that s very conservative in a good way  And them I m going to probably take my time on this house move thing  I m not that excited about going back into debt on the house move   All right  answers to more of your questions coming right up  Contact us at Daveonair Daveramsey com  You re watching THE DAVE RAMSEY SHOW on the FOX Business Network    COMMERCIAL BREAK   RAMSEY  Welcome back to THE DAVE RAMSEY SHOW  We re glad you re with us  We appreciate you joining us  America  Up next is going to be Courtney in Gainesville  Florida  Oops  let s try that again  There we go   Courtney in Gainesville  Florida  How are you  Courtney   CALLER  I am wonderful  It is so good to hear your voice   RAMSEY  Well  yours  too  darling  How can I help   CALLER  Thank you  My husband is in ministry  We have been relocated to this area  We had a house on the market    have a house in the market in the St  Petersburg area  It s been in the market for two years and here we are now with a lease to own offer   They are wanting to lease it for five years and put         down  And we are excited about it but need to know if we need some advice   RAMSEY  I wouldn t do it  Not a chance being tied to this house for five years  Your future is in Gainesville  Florida  not in St  Peter  This house can t be sold even if you re going to make less or whatever else  You know you ve got to make a decision to    you know  to part ways with St  Petersburg   And five years  That s ridiculous  No  I would consider this  I would consider leasing it to them with an option to purchase during the term of the lease  And it s a one year lease  If at the end of that lease you choose to renew the lease and renew the option  you could do that   But I would not enter into a rent to own contract  That is a bad deal for the seller  It s not a good deal for the buyer either  So    but a lease with an option to purchase on a one year add up time or you can make the decision  You re welcome to do that and    but I don t think a         down would make any difference if they don t ever close on the deal  except you keep the         and then you have a mess on your hands   So I d rather just let them lease it  If they don t pay the rent we evict them  That simple  And you know    and hopefully they can close on their option their right to purchase  The option needs to state that in the event they re in default on the lease that the option is invalid   They d lose their right to purchase the house if they don t pay the rent payments  And then it has the same effect as a rent to own  But it gives you a lot more control and it doesn t bind them to a deal  They don t have to close on the house  And you don t have to re rent it to them after a year   So I d lease it to them for a year with the option to purchase  lock in the price  You can take the         as a deposit on the rental if you want  and the deposit to be applied as the down payment later   That d be OK  If you want to do that  just hold it in an account  You don t spend it  And    because you ve got to give it back to them if they move out at the end of the year because it s a deposit  But I wouldn t take their money and tie them into a five year deal  That s not good for you or them   All right  Mindy is writing in by e mail   My husband and I are watching your show and we heard you say everybody needs life insurance  Due to medical reasons my husband cannot pass the blood tests for a life insurance  He s the provider for our family and I m disabled  What should we do about life insurance  Also we do not have medical insurance because either my husband and I both have pre existing conditions and the insurance is unaffordable  if we have a plan that will cover any thing  What do you suggest    Well  I don t know what the nature of your medical conditions are but I would be really scratching around trying to get a high deductible  affordable health insurance plan if there is any possible way  If he is simply not insurable under any circumstances for life insurance  I don t know what s in his blood but you know  you should bring it up here  his blood test  But    then you re looking for something where  like at work he can add on to his work policy without a medical check   Along with this  it s very high  it s very expensive versus what you can buy term insurance for where he insurable but a lot of these mortgage companies will provide you with the ability to buy without a medical checkup  mortgage life insurance which pays off your mortgage in the event that you pass away   At least you have that covered  And then these         policies and things are called guaranteed issue  They come with your checking account  That kind of a thing  But all of that comes to up   to    times more expensive than traditional term  So if you can find somebody in spite of his blood work that will give him some kind of a life insurance that s probably cheaper than those other option   All right  up next we re going to check out your e mail comments and find out what s on your mind  Don t go anywhere  You re watching THE DAVE RAMSEY SHOW on the FOX Business Network    COMMERCIAL BREAK   RAMSEY  Well  this is what s on your mind  Brian writes   I closed on my house yesterday     percent down     year note  When I went to the bank to get my loan the loan officer told me I was weird because he s reviewed    to    loans a month for years and couldn t remember when he had someone with no FICO score  Ha  Well  what he doesn t know is that my intention to pay it off is early as possible  Thanks for all you do   Very good   Michelle from Washington writes   I just received a phone call from a credit card company telling me they would lower our interest rate  I replied that we just paid off all of our credit cards and have no plans to ever use them in the future  The    seconds of stunned silence on the other end of the line was priceless     LAUGHTER    We ve been working the plan after reading the  Total Money Makeover  and within two years we ll be

car and will have the newer SUV paid off in the next eight months  After that  besides the house  we ll be    years old and debt free  Thank you  It s such a blessing to have found you at such a young

324,For example Diageo the drinks giant whose brands include Guinness Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff is a long standing holding that went into my forever fund at per share in October The price briefly exceeded last year before a series of sobering announcements put a stop to the party including last Monday s postponement of publication of its preliminary results City cynics sagely warned that bad numbers take longer to add up and the share price went flat at so I bought some more on Thursday Even at that level my modest gain is being topped up by dividends running at and covered times by corporate earnings While dividends are not guaranteed and dozens have been cut or cancelled during the coronavirus crisis it is notable that Diageo has delivered a series of pay rises for shareholders Its dividends have increased by over the past five years Subject to the results now due on August this long term investor continues to regard the current fears as a short term setback for a great British business Diageo closed at on Friday Greene King the Suffolk brewer is another example of doing the double with income and growth from the wet trade I allocated my full Isa allowance at per share in April when the shares were yielding more than Various saloon bar bores were kind enough to write in to say that I was wasting my time and money But the billionaire Li Ka shing seems to have disagreed because he bought Greene King for bn last August when I sold my Isa stake at per share bagging a five figure tax free profit Funnily enough another pubs group in which I invested Fuller Smith Turner also attracted an agreed m bid for its London brewery in January last year that time from Asahi of Japan I remain a shareholder not least for a discount off all food and drink at Fullers fabulous pubs Similarly I retain a small stake in the Kentish vineyard Chapel Down where I would only get p for shares I bought at p but will shed no tears because of a discount off the price of its excellent sparkling wines One of the few positive things to say about the coronavirus crisis is that it reminds us to have fun while we can Heineken the giant Dutch brewer is the last of my squiffy shares but by no means the least I paid in January for shares that cost now Nor is alcohol the only way to gain from drink and a desire to socialise As I may have mentioned before I invested in the tonic maker Fever Tree Drinks at per share in March and sold half of them at in October to help to buy the cottage I am sitting in now It s not rocket science is it Buy what you know is as good a rule for DIY investors as any Without wishing to sound like an absolute lush it would be fair to say I have done quite a bit of bottoms up research into the drinks trade over the decades Next Saturday I intend to do more But fears of a second wave of coronavirus and a subsequent clampdown on social interaction remain the ghost at the booze stocks banquet Investors should beware of what the economist John Maynard Keynes called animal spirits which a former chairman of the American Federal Reserve or central bank translated as excessive exuberance Ahead of Independence Day we might recall that William McChesney Martin another Fed chairman defined his role as being to take the punch bowl away just as the party gets going Bear in mind that share prices have been boosted by historic low interest rates As pointed out here several times over the years there simply isn t a better hole to go to if you are seeking real returns Now I note that fewer financial experts are expressing amazement at rising share prices and more of them have begun to dub this bull market TINA standing for there is no alternative Ever the contrarian I would just point out that shares prices will probably slump when interest rates rise However there is no reason to expect that to happen soon So any tendency to worry about such a prospect should recall another of Keynes observations In the long run we are all dead On a happier note I remember a lunch long ago before which Fred Trueman the England and Yorkshire cricketer gave this grace Blessed Jesus Lord divine you turned the water into wine Now forgive us humble men as we turn it back again Let s hope this party doesn t end with a hangover It s time we stopped feeding the FCA fat cats More than years after financial services were subject to statutory regulation our sleepy City watchdog last week mused about doing something to cap fund managers pay but not before next year Like St Augustine the suits at the Financial Conduct Authority appear to be saying Make us good but not just yet Christopher Woolard interim chief executive of the FCA said A new UK regime would represent a significant improvement in the regulation of investment firms For the first time it would deliver a regime designed with investment firms in mind Individual investors may wonder when we will get a look in But it s no use asking Woolard because he is halfway out of the door and due to be replaced by Nikhil Rathi chief executive of the London Stock Exchange in October Do try to keep up Why should we care Because the FCA s annual budget of m is funded by the companies that it regulates which pass these costs on to consumers With regulators eating their way through more than m a week including an annual salary of plus pension for Rathi it all adds up The more of our money that slumbers in the regulators and fund managers wallets the less that will be left to work for us Take a walk around the Square Mile or Canary Wharf in London and ask

325,The bad news is that several recent studies warn that Americans on average should plan on spending well over just in out of pocket medical costs during retirement But the good news or at least better news is that the challenge isn t so overwhelming if you break down the projected expenses into a smaller annual figure In a report released in June the Vanguard Group with help from Mercer Health Benefits projected a typical woman could easily face in out of pocket medical costs starting at age and extending over her remaining estimated lifespan of years The costs are roughly percent less for men partly because they tend not to live as long That projection doesn t include food housing and other routine expenses just medical outlays But the report instead encouraged people to focus on these costs as an annual expense not as a lump sum It estimated that the same hypothetical woman would spend about in annual health expenses in the first year at age rising gradually after that with inflation That s a more reasonable number a lower figure that might encourage more people to view the challenge as achievable That annual figure encompasses most medical expenses retirees would face including Medicare insurance premiums drug costs and other out of pocket outlays But it doesn t include long term care which could run tens of thousands of dollars for some retirees or nothing at all for others At any rate or so sounds a lot better than a couple hundred thousand dollars Multiyear lump sum projections are fairly unusual anyway as people tend to think more in annual costs when making decisions In a similar vein the Vanguard Mercer report explained that single person households in retirement spend about a year on average for food clothing and shelter excluding medical expenses citing numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Yet that same estimate projected over a year retirement stretch and without factoring in inflation would jump to more than Larger lump sum numbers could become behaviorally distracting the report stated meaning people could become so discouraged about saving that much money that they throw in the towel before trying Nevertheless lump sums are the way many studies estimate out of pocket costs for retirees For example the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College recently estimated a typical year old couple would need roughly for health care spending in retirement The Employee Benefit Research Institute assumed a year old couple would need while a Fidelity Investments study projected that a couple starting at age would need around None of those estimates included potential costs for long term care The point of the Vanguard Mercer approach wasn t to minimize the amount of money retireesmight need for medical expenses Rather it was to portray the challenge in smaller more manageable annual chunks Most studies point to a daunting out of pocket healthcare expense over the lifetime of a retiree said Jean Young one of the authors of the study and a senior research associate at Vanguard These large dollar values can be demotivating It s important to recognize that the various cost estimates are broad While the Vanguard Mercer report projected a baseline annual cost for a year old woman likely yearly expenses could vary from as little as to more than Personal health and other factors can push the numbers higher or lower So can factors like changing prices for prescription drugs It s also worth remembering thatfor people who retire early big medical outlays could begin prior to age when Medicare eligibility begins Some early retirees could have access to subsidized medical insurance through work that covers most health costs Alternatively nonworking individuals can obtain private insurance on their own Regardless people who retire before need to have a strategy to bridge their health care coverage between retirement and Medicare according to the study Then there s long term care Planning for these expenses are particularly difficult because while about half of seniors will require paid care others might not need to spend much if anything The Vanguard Mercer report recommends that people consider a range of resources to pay for long term care including personal savings and the equity in their homes Long term care insurance while expensive and difficult to qualify for might be another option So too for certain annuities that feature larger payments for people who need care Medicaid not Medicare is the government program that pays for long term care as a last resort after people have depleted most of their other assets or didn t have much to begin with The Vanguard Mercer study included several other tips for people seeking to grapple with out of pocket medical costs in retirement These include the following Consider Medicare choices carefully as the type of coverage you choose matters a lot Retirees may enroll just in original Medicare or pay extra for additional coverage The report recommended Medicare Advantage a popular private insurance addition as a cost effective option Start using health savings accounts if you re still working These accounts which require enrollment in high deductible health insurance plans allow people currently employed to accumulate money to meet medical costs in retirement In other words workers can pay current medical expenses from regular income while letting money in the accounts grow Contributions are tax deductible the money builds tax deferred and withdrawals come out tax free if used for medical expenses Stay healthy if you can Exercising eating well taking required medications as prescribed and following other smart behaviors also can reduce out of pocket health costs Even factors like marital status and employment can make a difference married people who keep working into retirement age tend to report better health the study said Reach Wiles at russ wiles arizonarepublic com or Russ Wiles Columnist Arizona Republic USA TODAY NETWORK,"Medicare pays for many of the health-care costs incurred by older Americans, but it doesn't cover everything. This creates a financial-planning problem â€” how much should a person expect to pay in out-of-pocket health-related expenses during retirement?

It's a tough question because there are so many unknowable factors: What medical problems will you face? How much will Medicare insurance programs pay? How long will you live? What about long-term care?",1,

327,Asselin wants to raise the rate from now to per thousand of equalized value The tax would be paid on second homes and business properties To offset their higher business property tax rate Asselin proposes cutting the business enterprise tax by a third and the business profits tax from percent to percent We need tax relief This plan provides it Asselin told the panel He estimates the cuts will reduce current business tax receipts by million Gov John Lynch has said that any education funding plan he signs will have to eliminate the state property tax which he calls an accounting fiction because it is paid entirely at the local level Asselin said his plan keeps the tax in place because we need a stable source of revenue to funding education in the future Other taxes will not keep up You need a broadbased tax to do that he said Asselin said his plan is better than four others under consideration because it significantly increases the Education Trust Fund boosts education grants in all but communities gives all homeowners a tax cut and provides enhanced tax relief to low income homeowners While the committee appeared open to his idea there were also worries that the plan takes the state so far in a new direction that it might take too long to put into place Revenue Administration Commissioner Phil Blatsos said he thinks it would take months to train state and local officials set policies for collection and distribution Asselin wants the bill in effect on July Saying he has no problem with the concepts in the bill Blatsos added I m uncomfortable with the time frame Asselin said his plan is based on a per pupil cost of each The per pupil grant from the state would vary depending on the wealth of each community Those with the lowest value of property on a per pupil basis would get the highest levels of aid Those with the highest property values would get the least Berlin for example gets per pupil while Gilford gets The plan calls for all state property tax payments to go directly to the state then be disbursed to communities under the targeting formula Current law leaves most of the tax within the town raising it Critics say that any plan to eliminate the statewide property tax will force local property taxes higher Asselin said he d be willing to include a measure of local income in his aid formula The sub committee is working on several plans at the same time and will be in session today if weather permits The plan it eventually recommends will have to pass a number of steps including a trip to the House Finance Committee before it can move to the Senate The state is distributing million this year from sources other than the statewide property tax Asselin s plan would distribute million raised through the state property tax as well as taxes on business restaurants real estate and other sources The key difference is that most homeowners are exempt from the tax he said It exempts the first of a home s value from the tax but Asselin said he is willing to raise the exemption higher He also raises from million to million the funds available to help low and moderate income local property taxpayers The bill counts not only income but assets including stocks bonds and retirement accounts Asselin also leaves the current school funding law in place as a back up plan in case the New Hampshire Supreme Court should rule some part of his plan unconstitutional Blatsos said the plan is so different from other models that it is difficult to estimate how it would affect state revenues He said businesses based outside New Hampshire that do business here could see taxes go down depending on whether they own property in state Those that are based here could see a tax hike depending on their property holdings Rep Mary Cooney D Plymouth said the Asselin bill would solve the problem that sees low income families having to pay high taxes because local property values are low Fred Bramante a former chair of the state Board of Education said the plan works This is a plan that will make this a better state for its businesses and for its citizens he said,"CONCORD -- A plan to raise the statewide property tax rate, but exempt most primary residences, drew more than three hours of testimony and questions yesterday.

328,This took me to a place that few of us would expect to visit the Finance Act This does indeed turn out to have been an important piece of legislation For that was when full tax relief first became available on contributions made to pension schemes In other words it created a valuable incentive for saving up for one s old age It was a further step in a social revolution that had begun in when Lloyd George introduced a National Insurance scheme paid for by employees and employers alike which was in essence a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment Now I hasten to add that Osborne s pension reforms have left the system of full tax relief largely intact Employers will go on taking pension contributions from your pay before deducting tax but not National Insurance contributions But one can see that if the state was going to provide a subsidy of this size to encourage saving for retirement it must have seemed perfectly reasonable to force these savers as far as one reasonably could to use their pension pots to purchase an annuity the financial instrument that actually produces a regular income until death Otherwise there would be a strong likelihood that the state subvention would be wasted And it is this near compulsory annuitisation with its penal per cent tax penalty on spending one s pension pot as one pleases that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has swept away However the problem for which compulsory annuitisation was supposed to provide an answer remains How can the state be reasonably sure that subsidised savings for retirement are sensibly used when the moment comes In its way Osborne s answer may prove to be as significant and as long lasting as the pension clauses of the Finance Act For in his amplification of his Budget statement he repeated that guidance on pensions choices would be guaranteed and that it would be provided by independent organisations And in turn this would be funded by a levy on regulated financial services firms The Treasury also announced that an individual would have had to take advice from an impartial financial adviser regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority before a transfer could be accepted Thus compulsory annuitisation is being replaced by compulsory advice Compulsory advice This is a novel concept In the vast market for financial products there has been a glaring disparity between the power and strength of the suppliers banks insurance companies unit trust groups and the like and consumers Only wealthy consumers have been able to afford the level of advice they require if they are to make successful purchases For the pass was sold in the s and early s when the High Street banks began to sell their own financial products starting with unit trusts This meant that from then on it was no use asking your bank manager for advice He or she had a straight conflict of interest Not a moment too soon this lousy system has recently been partially dismantled Compared with all this Osborne s proposals appear excellent The same body that supervises the major suppliers of financial services would regulate the new advisory firms And the costs would be paid by the industry So far so good But there are a lot of details to be settled In particular it appears that face to face advice would be the exception rather than the rule More reliance would be placed on internet based advice and consultations by telephone This would be a pity For there is no substitute for a full and frank discussion face to face Given that Osborne would have equalled his distant predecessor at the Treasury Sir Robert Horne the architect of the Act But I cannot refrain from adding that when I sought some biographical details I discovered that Sir Robert was known as a womanising bachelor and was famously referred to by a future Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as a Scots cad a whittamsmith independent co uk,"Comment

I never fully understand news events unless I know the history. I need to understand how we got here.

331,Establishing a low cost plan aimed at young adults who are required for the first time to buy health insurance The so called Copper Plan would have lower premiums but higher consumer cost sharing for medical care Insurers would have to provide the same minimum coverage required by the law Exempting companies that employ fewer than full time workers from having to provide voluntary health insurance plans for their employees Currently the exemption covers companies with fewer than full timers Increasing the number of companies that can qualify for health insurance tax credits Requiring state insurance regulators to design uniform rules so that policies can be sold across state lines The ACA legalized the practice but state officials worry about control of out of state providers Replacing new health insurance reporting requirements for small businesses with yet to be defined simpler methods Gillespie opposes the Affordable Care Act He proposed a replacement law that would abolish the requirement that most Americans buy health insurance and he would get rid of health care exchanges He proposes that the government provide tax credits for people without employer coverage to buy health insurance credits would increase with a consumer s age and family size His plan would no longer require insurers to cover a family s adult children until they are He also wants limits on malpractice awards to bring down insurance costs and discourage doctors from ordering extra medical tests His plan also would allow insurers to compete across state lines To encourage consumers to set up health savings accounts he proposes each person be eligible for a one time tax credit if they have an account He says his plan would cost just under trillion over years which he argues is less than half of the cost of the ACA Sarvis opposes the Affordable Care Act and favors deregulation of health care by Washington and the states He favors a national health care market with little state interference and would end tax breaks for employer based insurance He wants to lower the cost of medical care by greatly expanding both the number of medical professionals doctors physician assistants

Navy He and others in the state s delegation successfully pushed this year to keep money in the budget for the multibillion dollar overhaul of the aircraft carrier George Washington at Newport News Shipbuilding He opposed plans to cut financial support for military commissaries and has said proposals to change military pay or benefits should wait until a commission studying the issue finishes in early He was active in successful efforts to block Navy plans to transfer a Norfolk based carrier to Mayport Fla He voted for recent Veterans Affairs reform legislation passed in response to a scandal involving falsified records and appointment delays It included his proposal to use free services of private Virginia high tech firms to help upgrade the agency s patient appointment systems and

ships to He says hundreds of billions in reductions to defense spending during the Obama administration should be reversed He says if the ACA is repealed it would save more than trillion which could be used for defense and other things He supports changes to Veterans Affairs to deal with lengthy appointment delays and opposes proposals by Obama to raise Tricare copays for military retirees and families of active duty service members to help cover rising medical costs He opposes a proposal to reduce the subsidy for commissaries Sarvis says Pentagon spending can be cut and incredibly expensive programs like the Air Force s F stealth fighter the F Joint Strike Fighter and the V Osprey tiltrotor aircraft should be considered for elimination He says the military can shrink but Norfolk shouldn t be affected because the Navy will still want to use its natural deepwater port He says pensions and other benefits shouldn t be changed for those in the system but doesn t know whether changes should be made for new service members IMMIGRATION Warner voted for broad immigration reform approved by the Senate in Provisions include allowing people living here illegally to take steps toward citizenship more investment in border security visa programs for high tech and low skill workers and an E Verify program to confirm workers legal statuses Under the bill immigrants without proper documents could obtain provisional immigrant status if they meet certain conditions including not having a criminal conviction After years and several steps they could apply for citizenship Gillespie supports granting visas but not citizenship to the millions of people living here illegally after they complete a multistep process including criminal background checks payment of back taxes assimilation and demonstration of self sufficiency He wants stronger border security changes to the visa system and improvements to the E Verify system so that employers can be certain their workers are not here illegally Sarvis favors easing quotas to allow millions more to emigrate here and supports granting legal status to those here illegally if they haven t broken other laws He says after paying penalties they should eventually be allowed to become citizens BUDGET AND DEBT Warner has pressed for a bipartisan approach to reduce deficit spending and slow the growth of the trillion national debt He proposed shrinking deficits by cutting spending raising more revenue by eliminating some tax exemptions and loopholes and changing entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare He opposes changes for those who are retired or nearing retirement but he says the financing of benefits for future retirees has to change He opposes a balanced budget constitutional amendment that prohibits deficit spending He voted for the Budget Control Act in that included a trigger to start more than trillion in automatic budget cuts over years called

steroids Gillespie said the government cannot sustain its borrowing and growth in debt and he favors changes to entitlement programs to keep them intact He supports a balanced budget amendment and opposes raising taxes other than possibly shifting one revenue source for another He says a tax increase won t help shrink the size of government and wants to lower the federal corporate income tax rate from to percent He would offset that by eliminating some deductions tax breaks and loopholes Gillespie wants to simplify the tax code including taking away deductions credits and loopholes for the wealthiest Americans And he wants to increase the per child income tax credit possibly by consolidating it with other credits such as for dependents child care and adoption He would also let the deduction rise with inflation He wants to replace the earned income tax credit for low and moderate income taxpayers with wage enhancement tax credits to help low income workers stay on the job rather than seek unemployment benefits He said he would work to end sequestration but has not proposed a plan Sarvis wants to shrink the federal government substantially He wants a balanced budget amendment as long as it s balanced with cuts but no new revenue He wants to simplify the income tax code by removing all exemptions and deductions and favors abolishing the income tax or the payroll tax He says

business owners from providing insurance that covers contraception if it violates their religious beliefs He backs legislation to undo the court ruling and says such decisions should be left up to a

alternative should be adoption he says and government should make it easier to adopt or provide foster care He praised the Hobby Lobby ruling saying it affirmed our freedom of religion Sarvis supports abortion rights and says the federal government shouldn t be involved SAME SEX MARRIAGE Warner supports same sex marriage and voted for the repeal of the military s Don t Ask Don t Tell policy that banned openly gay service members He was a co sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act that would allow gay couples legally married in one state to have their unions honored for federal purposes such as collecting Social Security if they move to a state that doesn t recognize same sex marriages Gillespie says marriage should be only between a man and a woman but says some legal protections for same sex couples such as hospital visitation rights and survivor benefits should be allowed He says gay marriage laws should be decided by states He supported the federal Defense of Marriage Act that prohibited gay couples from being recognized as married under federal law until the prohibition was overturned by the Supreme Court in Sarvis supports same sex marriage ENERGY Warner Offshore drilling He favors drilling for gas and oil off Virginia s coast and has introduced legislation to speed up the timetable for exploration and drilling He will support offshore drilling only if Virginia is given a portion of the revenue He wants federal officials to more than double the size of Virginia s share of the off shore drilling planning area Under the current federal map the state has a

Barack Obama to approve the project Coal He has not said whether he supports Obama s proposed rule to decrease carbon emissions from coal fired power plants by percent by He wants to nudge the coal industry to find innovations for cleaner coal and says Virginia has competing interests on climate change with coalfields in the southeast and rising seas in Hampton Roads He had supported a cap and

336,From racial diversity to stringent lending standards there are myriad factors keeping Millennials from becoming homeowners at the same rate that older generations did Many of these factors are outside their control Experts believe however that a lack of knowledge can be as detrimental to first time homeownership rates as a lack of resources In a recent survey of renters said they believed they would need to put down more than to secure a mortgage In reality the median down payment on a mortgage in was just California Colorado Hawaii Oregon Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Vermont tied for the highest median down payments in the country at People don t consider themselves homeownership candidates when in fact they are says Laurie Goodman co director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute Even in areas of the country where it is much cheaper to buy than to rent people think I can t afford to buy because they don t have the necessary down payment Whereas in fact given where down payments actually are they do It s a huge deterrent What accounts for this misunderstanding For one low down payments are a relatively new phenomenon In just before the housing bubble burst the median down payment was Additionally a home buyer who put down less than often needs to buy private mortgage insurance which protects the lender not the homeowner in the event of default and costs between and of the loan amount each year To be clear all else being equal a higher down payment is better When interest rates are low as they are now it may pencil out to pay for mortgage insurance But the math gets harder to justify if you are taking out a mortgage when rates are high You may be charged a higher interest rate if you put down less than since some lenders view lower equity loans as riskier Starting with more equity gives both you and your lender some security if home values fall But building equity is also a key argument for why it pays to get into homeownership early even if you haven t saved of the median sale price of a home sold in April According to the Federal Reserve s Survey of Consumer Finances the average homeowner s net worth is times the average renter s The earlier you buy the more equity you can build over time You can tap into that equity for in an emergency or in your retirement My parents advice to me was real estate is basically an elevator all you have to do is get on says Justine Boucher a year old homeowner who realized she could buy a home after learning was not a requirement Here are four ways to become a homeowner without a down payment Government backed loans Borrowers with credit scores of or above can put down as little as on a Federal Housing Administration insured loan The upside is that is typically easier to qualify for an FHA loan than a conventional loan with a private lender The downside is that FHA borrowers who put down less than are on the hook for private mortgage insurance typically at a rate of until they refinance or pay off the mortgage With a private loan PMI is automatically cancelled after equity reaches of the purchases price Low down payment conventional loans With home prices climbing since lenders eventually caught on to the fact that high down payment requirements were making it difficult to attract new mortgage customers So around they began offering low down payment loans to borrowers with high credit and earning potential Like the special mortgages that have long been offered to new doctors who typically have substantial student debt and earn relatively modest salaries during residency these loans often don t require private mortgage insurance Credit score and payment size requirements vary and some programs require education for first time buyers You can start your search by reading Low Down Payment Mortgages Including Some With Low Or No Mortgage Insurance or Low Down Payment Mortgages By State Including States With An Option For

340,Health care experts worry that ultimately consumers in these states could end up confused about the exchanges and the overall rollout of the law could be hindered Without the shared planning and the cooperation of the state government it s much harder for them to be ready to implement this complicated law said Rachel Grob of the University of Wisconsin Madison who has studied differences in how states are implementing segments of the law Several of the Northeast Midwest and Western states running their own insurance exchanges have spent weeks on marketing and advertising campaigns to help residents get ready to buy health insurance At least million will be spent on publicity explaining what people need to do next and persuading the doubtful to sign up for coverage according to data compiled The Associated Press By contrast most states across the South have declined federal grants to advertise the exchanges and ceded the right to run the marketplaces themselves And early Sunday the Republican led U S House added to legislation that would avert a partial government shutdown a one year delay of the creation of the marketplaces Democrats have said delaying the health care law would sink the bill and the White House promised a veto Governors from the Carolinas to Kansas have decried the exchanges and the rest of the law which was passed by Congress in and many argue reaffirmed when voters re elected President Obama in The Supreme Court in upheld the constitutionality of most of the law a piece of the Medicaid expansion was an exception When it came to Obamacare we didn t just say no we said never South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley said last month alongside U S Sen Tim Scott whom she appointed last December when Jim DeMint resigned And we re going to keep on fighting until we get people like Sen Scott and everybody else in Congress to defund Obamacare Others have gone beyond fiery rhetoric Missouri s lieutenant governor urged residents to refuse to sign up for federal health insurance while Kansas legislators and the state s governor enacted a law symbolically declaring that residents can t be forced to buy health insurance In Florida state

the libraries the health departments said Jerson Dulis who was trained to help enroll people in the state exchange He works for Broward Community Family Health Centers Inc which received a federal grant to provide consumers understand and enroll in health insurance plans In places where state officials have declined to disseminate information the work is left to nonprofit organizations and word

confident that I know a majority of the information but it s gathering and I m looking at it I m preparing for the opportunity of the marketplace Sherry Graham said she s hoping insurance company

monthly insurance premium because the younger woman works only part time Every year here I am trying to find another or so to add to the monthly premium to keep her insured said Graham of Raleigh It s enough to hurt I have to figure out where to get that money from because I m not getting a raise like ever In response to confusion over the health overhaul officials in the Carolinas have grudgingly made moves to lessen disruptions North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory s health agency recently urged county social services departments to discuss the insurance exchanges when people come in seeking food stamps or child care help The Republican governor s administration also encouraged social services agencies to offer space as available to navigators In South Carolina which also left advertising and running the exchange to the federal government the state Medicaid agency ramped up its call center to handle percent more calls as people have questions about the law deputy director John Supra said

enacted declared that residents can t be forced to buy health insurance or penalized The measure was largely a symbolic protest given supremacy of the federal law Missouri bars state employees from

349,KNOWLEDGE LIMITS First some basic consumer theory Investors make the best decisions they can but are limited by their knowledge Collecting knowledge can be costly A new employee must select among numerous investment options by reading through fund prospectuses or looking for cues of growth Most people have made investments in learning a work related skill in order to earn a living but they haven t made an investment in how to be their own pension manager But creating million pension managers doesn t sound like a sensible public policy goal One way to help workers is to give them the information they need to make better choices This is the appeal of information policy If ignorance is the problem then give them a detailed brochure that contains everything they d need to know to make a better choice Unfortunately consumers may have no idea what to do with this information And more information makes the problem worse There is perhaps no sadder example of failed information policy than the mutual fund prospectus At an SEC roundtable Don Phillips Morningstar s president of investment research said that fund prospectuses were bombarding investors with way more information than they can handle and that they can intelligently assimilate To its credit the SEC tried to streamline the fund prospectus to only the most important information Unfortunately research shows that investors given a simplified prospectus still focus the most on fund characteristics that are irrelevant like past performance and ignore characteristics that matter like fees Disclosure can even be counterproductive In a paper Sunita Sah then at Duke University and George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University found that advisors were more likely to give self serving advice if they first disclosed a conflict of interest to their client When an advisor admits to a conflict of interest in a face to face transaction this creates two problems First the client now feels that if they don t accept the recommendation they are admitting they don t trust the advisor something that is taboo in human interactions The second problem is that the advisor now feels less pressure to make a recommendation that isn t self serving It is as if one can absolve one s sins by admitting to being a sinner The authors found that recommendations given by participants in the role of advisor were significantly worse for the consumer if they had to disclose conflicts of interest Examples may include the ADV Part among RIAs or any number of client disclosures required by FINRA Duane Thompson president of consulting firm Potomac Strategies notes that different disclosure requirements among regulators of financial advisors add to the confusion Disclosure across regulatory authorities in the financial services industry varies considerably even when financial intermediaries provide the same kind of retail advice such as retirement planning Differences in the latitude given to advisors in making self serving recommendations don t help either GETTING IT RIGHT The most effective financial disclosure laws have given consumers a little bit of very important information that is easy to use A great example is the disclosure of a consistent interest rate in banking products the APR mandated by the Truth in Lending Act Before the act banks could play games by varying the compounding period or other product characteristics in order to take advantage of less sophisticated consumers With the APR comparing terms was a piece of cake and anyone could easily select a competitive CD University of Chicago professor Eugene Fama found that consumer CD rates were basically identical to the similar duration bond rates obtained by more sophisticated investors It is easy for consumers to compare a single number That s why gas stations go out of business if they charge for a gallon of gas that costs down the street Many financial markets such as year fixed rate mortgages savings accounts and property insurance are much more competitive because it is easy for consumers to compare one number for products that have similar characteristics Retirement investments aren t so easy Nothing about the defined contribution retirement system in America is particularly efficient U S Rep George Miller D Calif famously posed with three quarters of a pie to illustrate the estimated of retirement savings lost to excessive plan administrator fees over a worker s lifetime Investments within retirement accounts tend to be expensive not very well diversified and not necessarily appropriate for the worker s life cycle stage A well functioning market for retirement assets would provide healthy competition among plan adminstrators to improve the quality of advising services and lower the cost of investing options Is disclosure the answer University of Michigan business law professor Dana Muir believes that there is room for improved disclosure within the retirement industry if the right information is disclosed to the right people There is a significant body of research questioning the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure says Muir Studies in a variety of disciplines indicate that disclosure often fails to enable the person receiving the disclosure to act more rationally than the person would have acted in the absence of the disclosure For disclosure to work those who get the information need to know what to do with it This is the problem with giving more information to workers They don t necessarily know how to use investment information to select appropriate retirement funds Muir thinks that fee and compensation disclosures to plan sponsors are more likely to have an effect on plan fee levels than disclosures to plan participants Plan sponsors have an incentive in meeting fiduciary obligations to consider fee and compensation information Disclosure seems to work a lot better in markets with informed participants who have an incentive to use new information New York University professor David Yermack found that the mere mention that a CEO was flying a corporate airplane for personal use within an SEC K form led to a same day drop of in the firm s stock price There is no doubt that mandating firm disclosure through the SEC to investors has improved the stability and efficiency of the U S equity market In retirement savings markets where employees must participate but often don t have the knowledge to make complex choices the best choice may be no choice at all This is the logic behind providing safe harbor to plan sponsors who select qualified default investment alternatives QDIAs for their employees If the default investment is generally appropriate for the worker s life cycle stage then most investors can avoid making bad choices Muir however doesn t think the plan sponsors should be on the hook in a system of investment defaults The sponsors often don t know more about selecting the right QDIA than employees particularly if they are small businesses in non finance fields And giving employees more disclosure about the risks of a default investment defeats the purpose of a default system That s why Muir believes that the primary job of the plan sponsor as a fiduciary should be to select the right plan administrator Leave it to the experts to select and defend which QDIAs to include in the plan New rulemaking by the U S Department of Labor is meant to provide disclosure to plan sponsors to help them select the right plan vendor Joseph Piacentini chief economist and director of policy research at the DOL s Employee Benefits Security Administration imagines that easier access to pricing will both help employers shop around and enhance competition among providers Piacentini notes that the rule will lay the groundwork for a more price competitive market not just on the demand side but also on the supply side Low cost vendors will attempt to poach business from their higher cost competitors Disclosure transparency as a regulatory tool works by affecting the behavior of the party receiving the disclosure but also the behavior of the party who must disclose something This is why some within the industry are seeing disclosure as an opportunity rather than a burden Lance Hocutt an advisor for Ameriprise Financial in Tuscaloosa Ala is looking forward to the opportunity to compete To him the new disclosure rules really help those advisors and plans who already provide full disclosure level the playing field And price isn t the only way to compete many employers look for a mix of cost and services when assessing an advisor s value I have a specific client service model for each plan which includes an annual education plan quarterly meeting dates and events Hocutt sees the much needed personalized service he provides to sponsors and employees as an informed advisor s greatest asset Until the low cost competition will put a broker in front of plans Hocutt sees a place for advisors who can provide the right level of service at the right price Disclosure may have a role in improving retirement security for Americans after all But regulators need to recognize when disclosure works and when it is a smokescreen that gets in the way of more effective policy The defined contribution retirement system is here to stay It s in everyone s interest to make sure employees get high quality plans at the right price Michael Finke Ph D is a professor and coordinator of the doctoral program in personal financial planning at Texas Tech University,"The defined contribution revolution saw employers shift responsibility for funding retirement to employees who werenâ€™t well equipped to become their own pension manager. One easy solution would seem to be information. Give people the right tools and theyâ€™ll be better able to select the right investments, the right advisors, and save the right amount of money. But is more information the key to improving retirement security?

New research provides insight into the promise and perils of disclosure as a policy tool. At its worst, disclosure is a waste of time and resources, draining millions of dollars from the financial services industry and achieving few measurable improvements in investor outcomes. At its best, disclosure can instantly achieve efficiency improvements within markets where itâ€™s difficult for investors to assess price or quality.",0,

351,The people who go to the Portsea Polo are a mixed bunch it s not all wealthy multi generational Portsea families So I went in curious to hear what those present thought might be in store for them in Some I spoke to drew comparisons with their industries as economic barometers and on those occasions the only way was up Overall the view was one of hope but there are some areas of weakness Ultimately it might come down to playing to our strengths and appreciating the good moments while they re here One person on a high and enjoying a good moment was Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop It was little wonder she looked so resplendent and confident given she d produced one of the more inspirational performances among our politicians last year She practically swanned into the Jeep marquee with the debonair local businessman David Panton by her side Animated and fun Panton must be a breath of fresh air for Bishop not to mention a salve for her eyes given what she s had to deal with and look at among her colleagues on the job On light duties but happy to chat Bishop says she d hoped would begin on a brighter happier note than but the shocking events in Paris and the loss of the AirAsia flight put an end to that notion In some respects has begun as ended Bishop says In terms of her portfolio she plans to focus more on building relationships with those in the Indian Ocean Asia Pacific region It s where Australia can make the biggest difference and have the most influence and I think Australia s standing in the world is at its highest when our influence in our region is at its strongest Referencing the upbeat mood around her at the polo she says Australians were naturally optimistic people but it was up to the government to help facilitate opportunity in and beyond I believe that there is a sense of confidence that times will be better And that s the role of the government to ensure we have in place the national security and national economic framework to boost that confidence Over at the Portsea Polo Club marquee chef Ian Curley of The European wasn t so sure about the upbeat outlook Despite having just opened another wine bar in Melbourne s Hardware Lane he believes will be tough for eateries I m running away from restaurants says Curley who plans to focus more on consulting and public appearances If you re going to open a restaurant these days you need a big backer but even then you re still not going to make that much money He predicts many big names in restaurants will struggle this year and that high profile chefs will increasingly lend their hands to charity Later in the Italian Riviera themed Peroni marquee I tried to track down under pressure Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour to find out where things sat with his plan to lift the price of stamps from to Missing him I went in search of Jayco founder Gerry Ryan but instead found myself face to face with his son Andrew which was OK with me I was soon mesmerised Sure Ryan had a lot of really interesting things to say about the five or so family businesses he helps run but I couldn t help but be distracted by his shock of rust coloured waves There s just something about red haired men Concentration was tricky but the upshot of what he said was that caravans aren t a bad economic indicator with sales up in the good times and off when things are flat The whole caravan industry s going well but Jayco s increased market share and is flying Ryan says Orders are up per cent on this time last year and retail sales were per cent better in than they were in calendar he says We re doing a caravan every minutes so if you re looking at that I guess there s hope for the economy Back in the Jeep marquee I came across the tireless managing director of Melbourne s Langham Hotel Ben Sington He was on the hunt for brand allegiances and sponsorships because he expects will be a big year in hospitality particularly for the southern capital With the lower Australian dollar already attracting more international guests and encouraging more domestic travel among the locals Sington was confident a string of extra sports events in Melbourne in the cricket World Cup the Asian Cup football and International Champions Cup soccer extravaganza would inflate numbers still further These are all big events for Melbourne and five star hotels get that kind of business Sington says As the polo ended my driver whisked me off to the less crowded Western Port Bay side of the Peninsula where I joined fellow Flinders Yacht Club members for the annual Commodore s Cocktail soiree They may be a down to earth bunch over there but they re every bit as aware of the long term issues we face as a nation In their sport they might have found one of the best ways to a happier Commodore Rod

aside and to live in the moment If only for a moment Have a terrific,"If you stepped out of 2014 hoping for better times ahead, you could have done worse than join the 6000-plus others who tramped

You can hear the episode wherever you get podcasts Place often gets overlooked when people think about how they can live a long healthy life Frederick said People don t understand how important place is in the context of healthy aging Many of us spend too much time focusing on what a prospective home s primary bedroom and appliances look like he noted and not enough about the social connections we ll have and can make in the area the home is in Frederick who incidentally hates moving is a consultant and researcher whose company SmartLiving focuses on the nexus between real estate and living

around the U S See The best little cities to live in the U S in One perhaps unexpected type of research Frederick recommends when choosing an area is scoping out how well poised it is for the future After all you ll probably be living there for years if not decades ahead You want to be in a place where it has a certain dynamic component to it where there s additional opportunities to grow and earn money in different ways Frederick said That also means assessing whether the area will likely be able to attract workers who will provide the kinds of services you may want and need including long term care Friends Talk Money podcast co host Pam Krueger advised beginning your research by coming up with a short list of possible areas maybe five ones where you can actually see yourself

live in a state where I might be able to reduce my expenses including taxes she said There are nine states that don t have an income tax and about a dozen that don t have any estate or inheritance taxes Picking a particular home When choosing a particular place to live a house townhouse condo retirement community or apartment Frederick said figure out what you re going to need in your personal space One of the sad things I see is you find people that love their home love their neighborhood but there s some fatal flaw in their house that will force them to move elsewhere earlier than they might prefer he said Also see Where s the best place for me to retire MarketWatch s updated tool warns you of climate risks while helping you find your dream spot Sometimes when choosing a home you

This downturn broke all the rules about padding one's portfolio with proper asset allocation. The problem was that as the global markets crashed, the correlation between opposing asset classes began to increase.

As money began to come back into the market, investors and advisors thought differently about portfolio creation and diversification. Both a higher level of risk aversion and the case for better risk diversification had been made, with the impact seen in allocations and products. On the core side, exchange-traded products began to proliferate and garner large amounts of assets. But demand for actively managed funds also continued.",0,

358,The credibility of hedge funds has been bolstered in recent years by a number of high profile and respected fund managers entering the market But rather than employing hedge fund strategies themselves these fund managers have brought a high degree of critical analysis and technical know how to the process of putting together portfolios of hedge funds so called fund of fund products and making them available to a wide range of investors Investors confidence has been further heightened by the fact that the fund of fund managers have been prepared to put in some cases a significant amount of their own capital into the same funds that they re asking investors to buy The fund of fund structure has benefits for investors namely the comfort that comes from the research or due diligence carried out on the underlying managers and the benefits of diversifying across a range of underlying managers and investment styles In addition unlike investing directly into a single strategy hedge fund there is a low minimum capital requirement in most FOF vehicles An investment in FOF allows the investor to gain access to several funds with a much smaller investment than would be required for an investment in each In some cases the initial investment is as little as But diversification is the key attraction for investors putting money into a fund of fund structure It reduces an investor s exposure to individual strategy manager and fund risk Typically hedge fund managers like ourselves design a portfolio from the bottom up and from the top down selecting managers on the basis of their skill in a particular area of expertise Colonial First State s head of hedge funds Damien Hatfield says Diversification across managers using the same strategy does little to benefit investors and is like holding a share portfolio of similar stocks such as mining companies he says A portfolio built in that way lacks diversification and is completely exposed to risks that adversely affect that sector such as moves in commodity prices A professional fund manager typically has the resources to commit to researching the skills and expertise of individual hedge fund managers and the analytical firepower to carry out extensive modelling and backtesting to come up with the optimal mix of manager and strategy Analysing and investing in hedge funds requires quantitative and qualitative assessment is time consuming and usually beyond the capabilities of the average investor Hedge Funds of Australia s managing director Spencer Young says This lack of capability to perform due diligence generally relates to a range of issues including location of the funds themselves technical skills required of the investor to understand and dissect sophisticated investment strategies lack of access to confidential and reliable market information high minimum investment requirements lack of access to the best funds which are typically closed and the ability to perform monitoring of the manager Even though the process of analysing and combining hedge funds is time consuming and complex there are simple issues that investors should focus on before determining whethera hedge fund investment is right for them Deutsche Bank for example suggests a list of questions that investors should be able to answer yes to before committing money to a fund of hedge funds see table above right However in general the analysis of underlying fund managers is aimed at minimising an investor s exposure to three general areas of risk Misrepresentation fraud risk not telling the truth Market investment strategy risk poor investment strategy or not doing what they said they would Business operational risk inadequate administration process procedures and reporting These general areas have in the past decade led either individually or in combination to the most significant hedge fund failures Some of the other areas that the fund of fund managers assess before deciding whether to employ a hedge fund manager include Management s motivation Integrity education employment history lifestyle attitude Its defined investment strategy whether an identifiable opportunity exists embedded market risks definition of investment process market knowledge in defined strategy Investment management capability portfolio management risk assessment and management ability strategy implementation experience in market conditions understanding the impact of market flows trading experience Funds under management critical mass verses manageable amount ability to manage growth quality and spread of investors Business operation back office infrastructure and reliability fee structure decision and execution process quality stability compensation and turnover of staff All this work comes at a cost to the investor however FOF and hedge fund managers don t consider themselves to be charities they expect to be reasonably rewarded for the effort that goes into constructing portfolios identifying researching and in the case of FOF managers continuously monitoring other fund managers But as a trade off FOF managers will often negotiate lower fees with their underlying managers than an individual investor could achieve if investing directly in the underlying specialist manager Despite the massive changes that have taken place in the industry a lack of transparency can still be an issue with some hedge fund managers And not all FOFs disclose with whom they invest This is most often explained as a competitive measure or as required by the underlying specialist manager However often the FOF manager will have greater insight into the underlying managers individual positions and styles than the average investor and is in a better position to perform due diligence POINT CHECK Answer yes to all of these questions before committing money to a hedge fund Is the fund managed by a global and experienced absolute return investment manager How committed is the investment manager to absolute return investments do they have their own capital committed Does the investment manager have sufficient resources to monitor the managers strategies and performance globally on an ongoing basis Does the investment manager have access to the top funds and investment capacity going forward Are the decision makers based in your region or are you simply dealing with a sales and marketing team Does the investment vehicle meet the local tax and regulatory requirements as well as provide limited liability Is the investment vehicle protected from currency fluctuations Does the fund report to investors frequently and with transparency Does the fund use a rigorous performance fee calculation including a hurdle rate and high water mark Does the manager manage money on behalf of institutional investors typically institutions are more diligent in their investment process Source Deutsche Asset Management,"Hedge funds

359,The European wealthy appear to love going to see their private bankers in Geneva or Lugano for them the cachet of the Swiss bank account where private banking was born in the th century seems undiminished While the North Americans are focused on capital markets the Europeans are more banking led Entrusting money to bankers for protection is deeply ingrained in the culture of the European wealthy who have witnessed far more social and political upheaval over the centuries than their American cousins Americans are generally more aggressive in their investment style using hedge funds for instance to a much greater extent But North American HNWIs are much more philanthropic and likely to give to charity helped by clear tax incentives to do so Figures suggest that America s rich are between two and five times more likely to donate to good causes,"
EUROPE AND North America together make up 61 per cent of the world's
high net worth wealth, with roughly equal contributions from the two
regions' rich. But the Merrill Lynch-Cap Gemini report paints a picture
of two different types of millionaires.



The European rich do not emerge from the study looking very attractive.
Europeans are much more likely to have inherited their wealth. And
Europe's millionaires account for more than $2,500bn of the $8,500bn in
total HNWI wealth that is held offshore - North Americans have less
than $1,000bn offshore. The report suggested that this is part of a
culture of secrecy among Europe's wealthy - most of this money is held
in Switzerland or Luxembourg. A less charitable interpretation would
attribute this to an attempt to avoid paying tax.

361,In a lengthy interview with ThinkAdvisor Inker who came to GMO right after graduating from Yale University years ago talks about the huge risk inherent in a Trump election a stock market bubble on the not so distant horizon what could easily trigger the next U S financial crisis the impact of Brexit and emerging markets among other issues critical to investors and advisors Inker is responsible for allocations of GMO s multi asset portfolios and portfolios that invest across equity regions Clients are chiefly sophisticated institutional investors For retail investors the firm is subadvisor for two Wells Fargo funds the Wells Fargo Asset Allocation Fund EAAFX and the Wells Fargo Absolute Return Fund WARAX both of which Inker manages A member of GMO s board of directors he has held a variety of posts during his rise including chief investment officer of quantitative developed equities ThinkAdvisor recently spoke by phone with the Boston based chartered financial analyst who has spent his entire career to date at GMO Where did he get that job lead From David Swensen Yale s longtime CIO and one of his professors Grantham called asking if Swensen had any students who could be a good fit with GMO It s been two dozen years and counting for Inker Here are excerpts from our interview THINKADVISOR What impact will the presidential election have on the U S economy and stock market BEN INKER A government can manage to destroy an economy if it so chooses and it s possible that a sufficiently ill advised set of policies in the U S could do profound damage We now have a candidate for president who is capable of that It s very hard to know what a Trump presidency would be like but some of the things he has said would be really scary It s possible that a Trump election would be the exception to the rule that it doesn t much matter who is U S president from an investment standpoint What if Hillary Clinton is elected Whether she turned out to be a particularly good president or a particularly bad one it seems unlikely that she d do anything to change the nature of the U S economy in a profound fashion Jeremy Grantham is Are you next in line to succeed him We aren t trying to base the firm on having another Jeremy Grantham and the firm hasn t set itself up so that in order for it to succeed I must be Jeremy doesn t have any day to day responsibilities for the portfolios Over time he gave over his responsibility for the management of client assets My team and I function independently of him He comes in every day and is thinking about important investment topics that can have impact on the portfolios But I am the portfolio manager he is not Do you have lots of meetings with him and then decide how to proceed Jeremy is a member of our investment review group and we meet periodically to talk about big things that are going on But I have the end responsibility for determining what it is we re going to do Do you see any signs of a bubble occurring now The U S stock market is getting closer to two standard deviations overvalued relative to history which Grantham defines as a bubble But we aren t quite there yet Maybe when the S P is at or we could plausibly be talking about bubble levels What about a bubble in bonds It s very hard to call what s gone on in government bonds a bubble in the normal sense because bubbles are usually characterized by euphoria and very positive emotions whereas it seems anything but with regard to what s happened with bond yields What impact has Brexit had on your investing As people who are attempting to be long term investors we think the impact on the true long term fair value of most companies whose stocks are traded in the U K is just not that big a deal Nothing happened that was material enough to cause us to say We need to jump in now and do something about it Please talk about the U S dollar in light of Brexit Brexit didn t particularly cause the dollar to strengthen since part of the dollar s strength has been on the back of an assumption that the Fed was in a hiking mode whereas the rest of the world was absolutely not Brexit seemed to put Fed hikes on the table U S house prices might beat the U S equity market in the race to cause the next financial crisis Jeremy Grantham wrote in an update to his Q quarterly report Do you agree Yes you could easily see housing causing the next crisis Home prices have now made quite an impressive recovery from their post financial crisis low but are pretty expensive again Compared to stocks a home is an asset owned by a much larger swath of households for the vast majority of people it s their biggest asset and owned with a lot of leverage So you could imagine a problem in the housing market caused by a normalization of interest rates Some people will find it difficult to pay their mortgages So that could precipitate another bubble If there are continued increases in housing prices that could create another bubble and another bust The contagion of a debt fueled asset bubble housing is much worse than a cash fueled asset bubble equities It generally takes close to a generation for assets to return to bubbleness after a real bust for people to lose their memory of how painful that was But markets seem to lose their memory a lot more quickly than they used to What s your outlook for the U S stock market for the rest of this year We don t much like the U S stock market but the fact that the market is pretty expensive doesn t necessarily stop it from going up It s an overvalued market in a world where most things that are cheaper look scarier and the things that look lower risk are deeply unappealing whether cash government bonds or investment grade corporate bonds We don t think the market deserves to do particularly well So up or down slightly would be perfectly unexceptional In all the portfolios where I have an ability to express a view on the U S market my multiyear view is that U S stocks are less attractive than stocks in the rest of the world Mr Grantham wrote in his Immigration and Brexit report in July that the U S market will hang in or better at least through the election Agree The election cycle has had pretty good predictive power We re in the fourth year of an election cycle and historically with few exceptions you tend to have a modestly up and stable year So now through November if history is a guide that s the best guess If you own the cheaper stuff you ll eventually win Why is the U S market trading at a significant premium to that of the rest of the world A big part of it is that the U S seems safer The presidential election aside bearing in mind what I said about a Trump election being the notable exception somehow the political risks seem less extreme in the U S than in some other places The economy here is doing better The market has done better People have trouble imaging the U S losing because it has won for a long enough time When the U S does lose again which will inevitably happen sooner than later it s going to come as a nasty shock because right now people have trouble imagining it What do you forecast for earnings growth in the U S Over the next several years the U S should struggle to see much earnings growth and profits might well shrink a bit If the U S grows sustainably from here it s probably going to be on the back of household incomes and therefore wages growing faster than the overall economy which means falling profit margins What if the economy is weak There will probably be falling profit margins on the back of falling sales So the good news would be gently falling earnings as rising revenues are slightly more than countered by falling sales margins The bad case would be a recession where profits would fall more sharply What s your outlook for bonds If something happens that causes inflation to be a lot higher or a lot lower than expected that can give you either a wonderful windfall gain or blow a nasty hole in your portfolio that takes a long time to dissipate Your thoughts about high yield junk bonds High yield bonds are probably worth a place in your portfolio today But we owned more high yields this winter and spring than we do now Yields have gotten to quite attractive levels but a real concern is that though investors are probably getting close to adequately paid for default risk they re not getting paid very well because high yield bonds have become very illiquid assets So what specifically are the implications We as a firm have concerns that we might well be at the start of a default cycle Trailing month defaults in high yields in the U S have now peaked above the long term average A lot of that has to do with energy and mining We ve seen very few events in history where we ve had a move up through the long term average level that immediately went back down and things were safe for high yield investors So we ve got some concern that the next few years might be bad from a default level perspective How are high yield bonds priced compared to Treasuries No worse than Treasuries in the event of a bad outcome and better in the event of something better than that You ve been overweight emerging markets What s your take now If you talk to investors about emerging markets in general you get eye rolls head shakes and Oh man we ve lost so much money It s hard to imagine emerging markets turning around People have very low expectations for this asset class And when people have very low expectations for asset classes good things can happen Is that the situation right now Our head of emerging markets has long said that the real money there isn t made when things go to from good to great but when they go from absolutely horrible to merely terrible So we re happy holders of emerging market equities today because they re priced for pretty bad things and bad things aren t happening Looking at Brazil it doesn t seem like there s been a positive headline about it this year But the Brazilian stock market has been just about the best performing stock market in the world What significance does that example have to GMO For quite a while we ve had complaints from our clients that emerging can do well only when the emerging economics are firing on all cylinders and that in the absence of that emerging is doomed to lose We don t believe this Again when expectations are really bad you can get very good returns when merely less horrible things come to be Do you see less horrible things in the offing It hardly takes a stretch of the imagination to think so We believe emerging markets are priced at a level where if that happens they can perform They deserve to make money in real terms which is exciting in a world where so many assets are priced not to give returns over and above inflation Any downside to emerging markets We re still quite worried about the aggregate amount of credit growth in emerging across the last five or six years We re still seeing that certainly in China But all else equal I d rather have a cheap market with everybody convinced that nothing good can happen than an expensive market where everybody is convinced all it can do is go up Please talk a bit more about China Growth in China is worrying The question is Can you find stuff to own there that s relatively safe even in the event of a credit induced problem or possibly is cheap enough that even if it isn t safe in a credit induced problem the expectations are so bad for it that it will do OK Despite our concerns about the economy there s stuff worth owning in China Broadly in what market sectors do you see opportunity We re not primarily sector people but what s definitely striking today is sector valuations variance in different regions of the world That seems to have a lot to do with how comfortable people are with the local economy Can you talk specifics In the emerging world where people don t have particularly high expectations for growth or in Europe some of the more cyclical sectors such as consumer durables and industrials look pretty cheap In the U S where the economy has been fine for a long time and expectations seem to be that it will continue to be we still like some of the more defensive sectors though consumer non durables have done very well and some of the consumer product companies do look pretty fully valued What are your thoughts about oil Our best guess is that there isn t currently enough investment in energy production to meet the world s oil needs for the next four or five years So reasonably one could see the price of oil creeping up over that period As you look longer than that oil whose overwhelming use is as a transportation fuel has a meaningful risk of being kind of pushed aside in favor of electric transportation It s hard to know exactly whether that s going to be a big deal in the s or not But it s certainly a risk Back to Brexit How will Britain s leaving the European Union affect the U S dollar long term Even if Brexit does not have long term impact on the British economy one presumes the likelihood of a recession in the U K during this period is reasonably high and they re not going to raise interest rates into that So the U S dollar might be looking for an excuse to stay expensive or get more expensive I m more confident that seven years from now the dollar should be cheaper than it is than I am that a year or two from now it will have gone down not up Related on ThinkAdvisor GMO s Grantham Why the Stock Market Won t Collapse This Year Reasons Not to Dump Emerging

interpretation of the regulation The proposed amendments implement the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd Frank Act provisions regarding mortgage loan servicing Specifically this proposal requests comment regarding proposed additions to Regulation X to address seven servicer obligations To correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers to provide information requested by mortgage loan borrowers to ensure that a reasonable basis exists to obtain force placed insurance to establish reasonable information management policies and procedures to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers to provide delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower s mortgage

working with the Cornell e Rulemaking Initiative CeRI on a pilot project Regulation Room to use different web technologies and approaches to enhance public understanding and participation in Bureau rulemakings and to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques The TILA and RESPA proposed rulemakings on mortgage servicing are the subject of the project The Bureau has undertaken this project to increase effective public involvement in the rulemaking process and strongly encourages all parties interested in this rulemaking to visit the Regulation Room Web site http www regulationroom org to learn about the Bureau s proposed mortgage servicing rules and the rulemaking process to discuss the issues in the rules with other persons and groups and to participate in drafting a summary of that discussion that CeRI will submit to the Bureau Note that Regulation Room is sponsored by CeRI and is not an official United States Government Web site Participating in the discussion on that site will not result in individual formal comments that will be included in the Bureau s rulemaking record If you would like to add a formal comment please do so through the means identified above The Bureau anticipates that CeRI will submit to the Bureau s rulemaking docket a summary of the discussion that occurs on the Regulation Room site and that participants will have a chance to review a draft and suggest changes before the summary is submitted For questions about this project please contact Whitney Patross Attorney Office of Regulations at FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

Protection G Street NW Washington DC SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION I Overview A Background The recent financial crisis exposed pervasive consumer protection problems across major segments of the mortgage servicing industry As millions of borrowers fell behind on their loans many servicers failed to provide the level of service necessary to serve the needs of those borrowers Many servicers simply had not made the investments in resources and infrastructure necessary to service large numbers of delinquent loans Existing weaknesses in servicer practices including inadequate recordkeeping and document management and lack of oversight of service providers made it harder to sort out borrower problems to achieve optimal results In addition many servicers took short cuts that made things even worse As one review of fourteen major servicers found companies emphasize d speed and cost efficiency over quality and accuracy in their foreclosure processes FOOTNOTE Federal Reserve System Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision Interagency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices at Apr Interagency Foreclosure Report available at http www occ gov news issuances news releases nr occ a pdf END FOOTNOTE The Dodd Frank Act Pub L July adopts several new servicing protections The Bureau has the authority to promulgate regulations to implement the new servicing protections These changes will significantly improve disclosures to make it easier for consumers to monitor their mortgage loans and servicers activities The changes also address critical servicer practices including error resolution prompt crediting of payments and force placing insurance where borrowers have allowed their hazard insurance policies to lapse FOOTNOTE See Dodd Frank Act sections and END FOOTNOTE The Dodd Frank Act also gives the Bureau discretionary authority to develop additional servicing rules The Bureau proposes to use this authority to adopt requirements relating to reasonable information management policies and procedures early intervention with delinquent borrowers continuity of contact and procedures for evaluating and responding to loss mitigation applications when the servicer makes loss mitigation options available in the ordinary course of business These proposals address fundamental problems that underlie many consumer complaints and recent regulatory and enforcement actions The Bureau believes these changes will reduce avoidable foreclosures and improve general customer service The proposals cover nine major topics as summarized below The Bureau s proposal is split into two parts because Congress imposed some requirements under TILA and some under RESPA This proposed rule would amend Regulation X which implements RESPA to implement section of the Dodd Frank Act concerning error resolution and force placed insurance and to impose additional requirements concerning reasonable information management policies and procedures early intervention with delinquent borrowers continuity of contact and procedures for evaluating and responding to loss mitigation applications FOOTNOTE Note that TILA and RESPA differ in their terminology Consumers and creditors are the defined terms used in Regulation Z Borrowers and lenders are the defined terms used in Regulation X END FOOTNOTE B Scope of Coverage The proposed rules generally apply to closed end mortgage loans with certain exceptions Under the proposed amendments to Regulation X open end lines of credit and certain other loans such as construction loans and business purpose loans are excluded Under the proposed amendments to Regulation Z the periodic statement and adjustable rate mortgage ARM disclosure provisions apply only to closed end mortgage loans but the prompt crediting and payoff statement provisions apply both to open end and closed end mortgage loans In addition reverse mortgages and timeshares are excluded from the periodic statement requirement and certain construction loans are excluded from the ARM disclosure requirements As discussed below the Bureau is seeking comment on whether to exempt small servicers from certain requirements or modify certain requirements for small servicers C Summary This is a summary of a Federal Register article originally published on the page number listed below Proposed rule with request for public comment

passed upon the adequacy of this prospectus Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense Before you invest you may want to review the fund s prospectus which contains more information about the fund and its risks You can find the fund s prospectus shareholder reports and other information about the fund online at troweprice com prospectus You can also get this information at no cost by calling by sending an e mail request to info troweprice com or by contacting your financial intermediary This Summary Prospectus incorporates by reference the fund s prospectus dated October as amended or supplemented and Statement of Additional Information dated October as amended or supplemented SUMMARY Investment Objective s The fund seeks the highest total return over time consistent with an emphasis on both capital growth and income Fees and Expenses This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy hold and sell shares of the fund You may also incur brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the fund which are not reflected in the table or example below Fees and Expenses of the Fund InvestorClass IClass Shareholder fees fees paid directly from your investment Maximum account fee a Annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as apercentage of the value of your investment Management fees b Other expenses Total annual fund operating expenses b a Subject to certain exceptions accounts with a balance of less than are charged an annual fee b Restated to reflect current fees Example This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds The example assumes that you invest in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods that your investment has a return each year and that the fund s operating expenses remain the same Although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be Year Years Years Years Investor Class I Class Portfolio Turnover The fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when the fund s shares are held in a taxable account These costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the fund s performance During the most recent fiscal period the fund s portfolio turnover rate was of the average value of its portfolio Investments Risks and Performance Principal Investment Strategies The fund pursues its objective s by investing in a diversified portfolio of other T Rowe Price stock and bond mutual funds that represent various asset classes and sectors The fund s T ROWE PRICE allocation among T Rowe Price mutual funds will change over time in relation to its target retirement date The fund invests in a mix of both actively managed funds and passively managed index funds which is an approach designed to reduce tracking error and result in lower overall fees in comparison to actively managed target date funds The fund is managed based on the specific retirement year target date included in its name and assumes a retirement age of The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely stop making new investments in the fund The fund is designed for an investor who retired at or about the target date and who plans to withdraw the value of the account in the fund gradually after retirement However if an investor retires earlier or later than age the fund may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor retires on or near the fund s target date Over time the allocation to asset classes and funds will change according to a predetermined glide path shown in the following chart the left axis indicates the overall neutral allocation to stocks with the remainder of the allocation to bonds The glide path represents the shifting of asset classes over time and shows how the fund s asset mix becomes more conservative both prior to and after retirement as time elapses This reflects the need for reduced market risks as retirement approaches and the need for lower portfolio volatility after retiring Although the glide path is meant to dampen the fund s potential volatility as retirement approaches the fund is not designed for a lump sum redemption at the retirement date The fund pursues an asset allocation strategy that promotes asset accumulation prior to retirement but it is intended to also serve as a post retirement investment vehicle with allocations designed to support an income stream made up of regular withdrawals throughout retirement along with some portfolio growth that exceeds inflation After the target date the fund is designed to balance longevity and inflation risks along with the need for some income although it does not guarantee a particular level of income SUMMARY The glide path provides for a neutral allocation to stocks at the target date of The fund s overall exposure to stocks will continue to decline until approximately years after its target date when its neutral allocations to stocks and bonds will remain unchanged There are no maturity restrictions within the fund s overall allocation to bonds although the bond funds in which the fund invests may impose specific limits on maturity or credit quality The allocations are referred to as neutral allocations because they are strategic and do not reflect any tactical decisions made by T Rowe Price to overweight or underweight a particular asset class or sector based on its market outlook The target allocations assigned to the broad asset classes Stocks and Bonds which reflect these tactical decisions resulting from market outlook are not expected to vary from the neutral allocations set forth in the glide path by more than plus or minus five percent The target allocations and actual allocations may differ due to significant market movements or cash flows The following table illustrates how the portfolio is generally expected to be allocated between the asset classes and the underlying T Rowe Price mutual funds that are used to represent the broad asset classes and specific sectors The fund invests in the Z Class of each of its underlying funds T Rowe Price is contractually obligated to waive and or bear all of the Z Class expenses with certain limited exceptions The fund s overall allocation to stocks is represented by a diversified mix of U S and international stock funds that employ both growth and value investment approaches and consist of large cap mid cap and small cap stocks The fund s overall allocation to bonds is represented by a core fixed income component designed to have lower overall volatility and a diversifying fixed income component designed to respond to a variety of market conditions and improve risk adjusted returns The information in the table represents the neutral allocations for the fund as of October The fund s shareholder reports set forth its actual allocations between stock funds and bond funds and to the individual T Rowe Price mutual funds T Rowe Price may periodically rebalance or modify the asset mix

share price fluctuates which means you could lose money by investing in the fund You may experience losses including losses near at or after the target retirement date There is no guarantee that the fund will provide adequate income at and through your retirement The principal risks of investing in this fund which may be even greater in bad or uncertain market conditions are summarized as follows Active management Asset allocation The fund s overall level of risk will directly correspond to the risks of the underlying funds in which it invests By investing in many underlying funds the fund has partial exposure to the risks of different areas of the market However the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund s assets among the various asset classes market sectors and investment styles represented by those underlying funds could cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar benchmark or investment objective s SUMMARY Investments in other funds The fund bears the risk that its underlying funds will fail to successfully employ their investment strategies One or more underlying fund s underperformance or failure to meet its investment objective s as intended could cause the fund to underperform similarly managed funds Market conditions The value of the fund s investments may decrease sometimes rapidly or unexpectedly due to factors affecting an issuer held by an underlying fund particular industries or the overall securities markets A variety of factors can increase the volatility of an underlying fund s holdings and markets generally including political or regulatory developments recessions inflation rapid interest rate changes war military conflict or acts of terrorism natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious illnesses or other widespread public health issues such as the coronavirus pandemic and related governmental and public responses including sanctions Certain events may cause instability across global markets including reduced liquidity and disruptions in trading markets while some events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others Government intervention in markets may impact interest rates market volatility and security pricing These adverse developments may cause broad declines in market value due to short term market movements or for significantly longer periods during more prolonged market downturns Bond exposure An underlying bond fund s share price can fall because of various factors affecting bonds or due to general weakness in the overall bond markets The fund invests in underlying funds with varying levels of credit risk interest rate risk inflation risk and liquidity risk At times participants in bond markets may develop concerns about the ability of certain issuers to make timely principal and interest payments or they may develop concerns about the ability of financial institutions that make markets in certain debt instruments to facilitate an orderly market Those concerns could cause increased volatility and reduced liquidity in particular securities or in the overall bond markets and the related derivatives markets which could hamper an underlying fund s ability to sell the bonds in which it invests or to find and purchase suitable investments Stock exposure An underlying stock fund s share price can fall because of weakness in the overall stock markets a particular industry or specific holdings Stocks generally fluctuate in value more than bonds and may decline significantly over short time periods There is a chance that stock prices overall will decline because stock markets tend to move in cycles with periods of rising and falling prices The value of an underlying stock fund may decline due to general weakness or volatility in the stock markets adverse conditions impacting a particular industry or market sector or factors affecting an investment style or market capitalization targeted by the fund International investing Investing in underlying funds that hold the securities of non U S issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in underlying funds that hold securities of U S issuers Non U S securities tend to be more volatile and have lower overall liquidity than investments in U S securities and may lose value because of adverse local political social or economic developments overseas or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U S dollar In addition investments outside the U S are T ROWE PRICE subject to settlement practices and regulatory and financial reporting standards that differ from those of the U S The risks of investing outside the U S are heightened for any investments in emerging markets which are susceptible to greater volatility than investments in developed markets Emerging markets Investing in underlying funds that hold securities of issuers in emerging market countries involves greater risk and overall volatility than investing in underlying funds that hold securities of issuers in the U S and other developed markets Emerging market countries tend to have economic structures that are less diverse and mature less developed legal and regulatory regimes and political systems that are less stable than those of developed countries In addition to the risks normally associated with investing outside the U S emerging markets are more susceptible to governmental interference political and economic uncertainty local taxes and restrictions on an underlying fund s investments less efficient trading markets with lower overall liquidity and more volatile currency exchange rates Interest rates The prices of and the income generated by bonds and other debt instruments held by an underlying fund may be affected by changes in interest rates A rise in interest rates typically causes the price of a fixed rate debt instrument to fall and its yield to rise Conversely a decline in interest rates typically causes the price of a fixed rate debt instrument to rise and the yield to fall The prices and yields of inflation linked bonds are directly impacted by the rate of inflation as well as changes in interest rates Generally underlying bond funds with longer weighted average maturities and durations carry greater interest rate risk Changes in monetary policy made by central banks and or governments such as the discontinuation and replacement of benchmark rates are likely to affect the interest rates or yields of securities in which an underlying fund invests Prepayments and extensions Underlying funds that invest in mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities or any debt instrument with an embedded call option are subject to prepayment risks because the principal on the security may be prepaid at any time which could reduce the security s yield and market value The rate of prepayments tends to increase as interest rates fall which could cause the average maturity of the underlying fund s portfolio to shorten Extension risk may result from a rise in interest rates which tends to make mortgage backed securities asset backed securities and other callable debt instruments more volatile Credit quality An issuer of a debt instrument held by an underlying fund could suffer an adverse change in financial condition that results in a payment default failure to make scheduled interest or principal payments rating downgrade or inability to meet a financial obligation The fund s exposure to credit risk is increased to the extent the fund invests in underlying funds that hold securities that are not considered investment grade Holdings that are rated below investment grade carry greater risk of default and erratic price swings due in part to potentially adverse changes in the credit quality of the issuer Market capitalization Because the fund invests in certain underlying funds that focus on a particular market capitalization its share price may be negatively affected if investing in that market capitalization falls out of favor Small and mid cap companies often have less experienced management more limited financial resources and less publicly available SUMMARY information than large cap companies and tend to be more sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions As a result investments in small cap and mid cap companies are likely to be more volatile than investments in large cap companies However large cap companies may not be able to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies especially during strong economic periods and they may be less capable of responding quickly to competitive challenges and industry changes Investment style Because the fund invests in certain underlying funds that focus on growth stocks and certain underlying funds that focus on value stocks its share price may be negatively affected if either investing approach falls out of favor Growth stocks tend to be more volatile than the overall stock market and are more sensitive to changes in current or expected earnings Value stocks carry the risk that investors will not recognize their intrinsic value for a long time or at all or that they are actually appropriately priced at a low level Inflation To the extent the fund invests in underlying funds that are designed to provide protection against the impact of inflation those investments could adversely affect the fund s performance when inflation or expectations of inflation are low During such periods the values of an underlying fund s investments in inflation linked securities or stocks designed to outperform the overall stock market during periods of high or rising inflation could fall and result in losses for the fund causing the fund to lag the performance of similarly managed funds Liquidity An underlying fund may not be able to meet requests to redeem shares without significant dilution of the remaining shareholders interests in the fund A particular investment or an entire market segment may become less liquid or even illiquid sometimes abruptly which could limit a fund s ability to purchase or sell holdings in a timely manner at a desired price Reduced liquidity can result from a number of events such as limited trading activity reductions in bond inventory and rapid or unexpected changes in interest rates Large redemptions may also have a negative impact on an underlying fund s overall liquidity Bank loans Underlying funds that invest in bank loans expose the fund to additional risks beyond those normally associated with more traditional debt instruments An underlying fund s ability to receive payments in connection with a loan depends primarily on the financial condition of the borrower and whether or not a loan is secured by collateral although there is no assurance that the collateral securing a loan will be sufficient to satisfy the loan obligation In addition bank loans often have contractual restrictions on resale which can delay the sale and adversely impact the sale price and they have significantly longer settlement periods than more traditional investments Bank

374,As early as October the U S Department of Labor is expected to propose new rules that would ensure that brokers and other securities professionals would act solely for the benefit of their clients when advising on individual retirement accounts Those assets are a giant honey pot with trillion in IRAs according to the Federal Reserve The Dodd Frank financial regulation law of authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish a no less stringent fiduciary standard for brokers than the duties that investment advisers must follow How that will play out may depend largely on the ferocious lobbying battle raging over the Labor Department s plan The period for public comment on what an SEC rule should look like officially ended in July The SEC staff a spokesman says is carefully considering the comments we received and will coordinate with the commissioners on next steps The SEC won t say how long that might take Meanwhile the Labor Department is charging full speed ahead and raising hackles in the brokerage industry The DOL is clearly moving forward on a track that s inconsistent with where the policy should end up Judd Gregg the former Republican U S Senator from New Hampshire who serves as chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Wall Street s main trade group told me It s a dangerously large expansion that will chill all kinds of activity Mr Gregg says it would be a disaster a nightmare if the DOL sets a separate fiduciary standard for IRAs We don t think the DOL is moving forward in a way that s going to be constructive at all it s going to be destructive adds Mr Gregg The folks with small accounts are going to lose the ability to get advice and their costs will go up The heart of the matter Fiduciaries should avoid conflicts but brokers are generally required only to disclose them Having a completely conflict free relationship doesn t work in practice across most of the brokerage industry says John Taft head of RBC Wealth Management in the U S which manages billion For example when your broker s firm underwrites an initial public offering of stock he and the firm earn far more by selling some of those shares to you than selling you something else When your broker buys you a bond out of his firm s inventory of your broker s firm rather than on the open market the firm also tends to make more money Industry groups have argued that if brokers can t have any conflicts like earning higher fees on some investments than on others then they no longer will be able to afford handling small accounts The brokerage industry is saying in effect If you don t allow us to continue to give conflicted advice we won t be able to give any Assistant Secretary of Labor Phyllis Borzi who oversees retirement benefits told me But there are lots of people out there who are already acting as fiduciaries and they re not bankrupt They re making money Labor Department officials can t comment on the details of the pending rule proposal but Ms Borzi says the agency and the SEC are working very closely to ensure that their agendas don t clash There are several possibilities say legal experts Advisers could be restricted from enticing retirees to sell one investment they already hold in order to buy another says Tamar Frankel a professor at Boston University who specializes in fiduciary law Arthur Laby a securities law professor at Rutgers University suggests that brokers could be permitted to fill orders for individual investors from their firms own inventory only for readily marketable highly liquid securities and that firms could be prevented from paying their advisers more for selling in house products There s no mileage in it for anybody to come up with a rule that is unduly burdensome Ms Borzi says But when people rely on experts for advice on what is probably the biggest chunk of money they ve ever had in their life the advisers have a responsibility to work for the clients best interests and not their own Meanwhile ask your adviser Do you or your firm earn more money for recommending this investment Can you suggest a simpler cheaper way of accomplishing the same goal Investors can always act as their own fiduciaries just in case their advisers aren t Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor wsj com,"In the next few weeks, the way investors get advice could change forever.

375,Brings investors equity upside while trying to limit downside By Thomas Gryta The Invesco Convertible Securities fund CNSAX seeks to harness perhaps the best aspect of convertible bonds let investors benefit from rising equity prices while reducing downside risk when they drop A convertible is a hybrid investment instrument a corporate bond with the option of being converted into a pre determined number of common shares at certain price That allows it to trade like a stock as equity value rises but a floor is provided by the coupon payments and return of the principal at maturity It is a defensive approach to equities said Ellen Gold lead manager of the fund The fund is up for the year as of Monday about percentage points above the Morningstar category average for open end convertible funds In the last three and five years the fund s average annual total returns were and respectively topping the category by percentage points and percentage points Depending on market factors a convertible can be more sensitive to either the price of underlying equity or to the price of the bond Morningstar mutual fund analyst Michelle Canavan specializes in convertible funds there are only about and said the Invesco fund has been particularly good at adjusting its portfolio to the wider environment of the markets and economy This allowed the fund to limit the damage of the financial crisis in but benefit from the upswing in later years Overall she said convertible funds can play a role in an investors portfolio It can be a good diversifier in this environment but it will be riskier than your typical fixed income fund Ms Canavan said The Invesco fund typically looks for convertible securities that offer to of the upside from the underlying equity but with only to of the downside Ms Gold said Once it finds issues that match the profile the fund conducts traditional equity analysis on the company and its stock Because it is a bond the fund must factor in credit risk to some degree even though many convertible issues aren t rated by credit rating agencies If we don t like the underlying common stock chances are we aren t going to buy the convertible she said The fund invests in some busted convertibles which are those that have fallen enough below their conversion price that they are likely to be converted and thus trade more like a bond The credit of the company has deteriorated but not to the point of being distressed Ms Gold said It owns busted convertibles in several financial services companies as part of its top holdings including Bank of America Corp BAC and Wells Fargo Co WFC notes co manager Ramez Nashed The fund only invests in true convertibles as opposed to synthetic convertibles that are typically constructed through a mix of investment grade bonds and long term options on a particular stock Turnover of the fund s holdings varies but has dropped in recent years because the number of new issues has fallen as companies opt to take advantage of low interest rates to issue traditional debt The total convertible market is about billion according to Ms Gold In terms of individual investments the fund likes Gilead Sciences Inc GILD which makes HIV medication drugs and is developing a new one pill treatment for Hepatitis C Ms Gold likes the reliability of the HIV treatment business while also having potentially significant growth opportunities from the success of the Hepatitis C treatment The Invesco fund holds Gilead s coupon convertible with a May maturity which currently has a yield It doesn t sound like a lot but the common stock doesn t pay a dividend she said The bond has a conversion premium the amount paid in excess of a similar traditional bond without conversion which she considers to be low She notes that the bond will benefit from a rising stock price and the short maturity timeline means it will behave like a traditional bond if the shares drop Ms Gold also likes network equipment maker Ciena Corp CIEN because it should benefit from AT T Inc s T recent announcement to increase its capital spending on its wireless and landline networks AT T has typically been Ciena s largest customers Ms Gold said The fund owns Ciena s coupon convertible with a March maturity and a current yield She expects the benefits of AT T s investment may take some time to materialize but should boost the stock If you are wrong you are getting par back but in the meantime you re getting a coupon for the next three years she said Thomas Gryta covers the U S telecom industry for Dow Jones He can be reached at or

376,PLANNING TO QUIT Family Finance asked Derek Moran head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with George to assess his readiness George has annual take home income composed of salary and dividends from his taxable investments of Mr Moran notes His expenses net of savings are just a year He actually seems addicted to saving but there is tax planning that we can do On retirement George will have a company pension of about a year That s the result of the common retirement plan which multiplies of final income about now by years of service George could split income when he retires with his new wife to take advantage of the new family tax credit though the tax savings for these parents of children under will be modest Her earned income of about a year will exceed his income but not by much He would pay more tax she would pay less When both are retired the children will be over and the tax break will vanish Entering into a union with his spouse to be who is years younger offers a significant tax advantage because he can set the minimum distributions from his RRIF on her age rather than his If he had no spouse his distribution rate would be of RRIF assets Using her age it is about He is effectively cutting the initial payout by about half keeping what is not paid out in the RRIF still growing paying tax on about half the money he would have had to take without the spouse and extending the life of his RRIF Mr Moran notes The minimum distribution rate will climb but her age will provide a discount for decades COSTS AND BENEFITS If George does buy a house with his fianc e he needs to put his name on the title He will then be entitled to share provincial homeowner tax refunds Manitoba currently provides persons over a cash refund of a year on top of as much as a year in property tax credits already available to seniors By marrying he is taking on family obligations She will pay most of the costs of raising her two young children and paying for their educations but she might outlive him and collect his pension benefits for decades George has to weigh the cost of giving up of his pension taking to of that amount instead to provide for his wife Given that her income is nearly as much as his earnings taking a survivor option is not essential Mr Moran says RETIREMENT INCOME Drawing income from his of non registered investments and TFSA is not important for the time being George s retirement income will exceed his probable spending even with the additional costs of a shared family life George s portfolio has an Achilles heel that is a concentration on stocks that could plummet in hard times He has several mutual funds constructed to harvest dividend income and a portfolio of U S large caps and Canadian financial services companies but hardly any government bonds He needs to add some to provide for an extended market decline When stocks are falling government bonds tend to gain value as investors rush for guaranteed payment of income and repayment of principal Long bonds with terms up to years though exposed to loss should interest rates rise several per cent have recently generated huge gains driven by pension funds and insurance companies Swapping energy stocks for bonds in low fee mutual funds or ETFs would be worth considering Mr Moran says A allocation to bonds and to equities would be a sensible balance However given that George s income from defined benefit and government pensions is secure he could lower the allocation to bonds When retired George will have his pension and of income from non registered assets generating a year after inflation for total income of a year After average tax he would have a year to spend He will likely continue to add to his TFSA but keep it intact as a rainy day fund which at age would have a balance of with the after inflation growth assumption CPP benefits of at rates at age would push his total annual income to After tax at about he would have a year to spend A year later at he could add annual OAS in dollars but probably lose all of it to the clawback the exact loss dependent on dividends from non registered stocks At his RRSP having grown at a year for years from at retirement to in dollars packaged in a RRIF could begin payments based on his wife s age at about a year making final pre tax income about a year After application of age based tax credits and pension income credits and average tax of he would have about a year to spend Were he to draw a year from his TFSA it could add a year in untaxed income for total disposable income of a year Estimating his future wife s retirement income at age is speculative If she continues to work for years she might add of pre tax job pension income plus full CPP and OAS benefits to family income This case shows what being frugal can do for a retirement Mr Moran says George s spending never rose to match his income As a result he will have a reserve for a long and probably pleasant retirement

manufacturing company in Manitoba. Retirement at 54 is early, but as George explains, he has issues of spiritual and physical exhaustion. ""I am tired of working,"" George explains. ""I have seen friends and family die or have serious health issues. I want to enjoy my life now while I am in good health, and able to enjoy the fruits of my labour."" George has the luxury of early retirement, because he has saved zealously, he has a company pension, and he has had only himself to support. But changes, including marriage, are coming. He worries these changes could derail his plan.

George is preparing a new stage of his life, with a woman who is 41. He can sell his home, a 600-squarefoot starter house with a current estimated price of $210,000, then live with his lady and her two children, ages 9 and 11, and eventually they'll buy a larger home together.",1,

381,You ve made some life decisions that you ve regretted and some of those decisions surely involve money What sort of money mistakes have you made Don t be shy about admitting your financial mistakes According to the latest version of Finder com s annual America s Biggest Money Mistakes survey you have million fellow Americans to keep you company More than three quarters of respondents claimed to have made a money mistake in their lifetime We re surprised that number isn t closer to As Finder com Consumer Advocate Jennifer McDermott says It s understandable that so many have made a money mistake in our lifetime we re only human However while a slip up doesn t need to derail our entire financial wellbeing it s important to recognize the triggers to make better choices in the future What s the most cited financial mistake By far the winner was spending too much money on fun activities such as shopping vacations or dining out Almost of respondents claimed this financial error Blowing too much on fun is the number one money mistake Americans are making It s easy when you re swept up in the moment to only listen to what makes us feel good right there and then whether that s a new dress another drink or booking a last minute vacay empathizes McDermott However it s important to assess how you re likely to feel after spending that amount of money Will it still seem like a good idea when the credit card bill arrives Women were more likely to admit this overspending at compared to of men Are men more unwilling to admit financial mistakes in general Truth be told there was only a one percentage point difference between men and women who admitted past financial mistakes for women for men Even so there are some insightful differences in the types of mistake claimed more by either sex Along with overspending women were also more likely to regret letting their partner control the family finances to for men The categories where men had much greater regrets than women suggest tendencies for riskier behavior Almost one quarter of men surveyed regretted making a bad investment compared to only of women In addition of male respondents reported too much gambling as a fiscal error compared to only of female respondents Perhaps testosterone trumps proper risk assessment Men and women reported the second largest financial regret at about the same rate of women and of men regretted dropping out of college It s fair to call dropping out a financial regret based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS As of college dropouts earned a median wage of per week well below the median of for all workers Those with bachelor s degrees had a median weekly salary of Unemployment rates show a similar pattern for college dropouts for those with bachelor s degrees The number of people naming dropping out of college as a money mistake shows there s a need for greater discussion about career pathways For those yet to attend it s worth taking some time to research and determine your options before locking in your major suggests McDermott This may come in the form of a gap year or entering into the world of internships both of these can inform your decision and help you decide what industry is right There s no rush Doing this could save you a lot in the student debt you accumulate by dropping out without earning a degree The survey found some generational differences but perhaps not as much as you might expect Millennials and Generation X ers were almost equally likely to admit financial mistakes to respectively Baby boomers were least likely to admit a money mistake at a questionable number because baby boomers have had more time to make financial mistakes than the other generations Individual money mistakes were a bit more predictable along generational lines Millennials were far more likely to admit overspending on fun activities than generation X ers and baby boomers Baby Boomers were more likely to regret bad investments compared to generation X ers and millennials Other financial regrets include overpaying for a wedding getting caught in an online scam and having children It s odd to consider having children as a financial regret because we d like to think that your investment in a child isn t for financial payback Still the average cost of raising a child born in through the age of is estimated at over according to a report released by the U S Department of Agriculture and that value probably hasn t been decreasing So you ve made some mistakes with your money Who hasn t Outside of the nearly one quarter of respondents whom we believe simply won t admit it The real point is that you learn from those mistakes and don t repeat them If you continue to make money mistakes eventually you won t

those years and I can t take away the gray hairs and I can t take away the stress It seems like a small thing to do to say I m sorry but I m very sorry And we want to work to fix it and correct it Kaitlyn McCollum is one of the teachers who lost her grant money unfairly and like many of them her story began with a letter that sent her reeling The mailbox Two years ago the high school teacher in Columbia Tenn walked to the mailbox pregnant with her first child and opened an official looking letter from the Education Department I remember going out to the mailbox I even opened it up at the mailbox and sheer panic just set in McCollum says Her federal TEACH Grants had been turned into more than in loans The reason McCollum had narrowly missed a deadline for mailing in some annual paperwork She walked inside sat at the family table beside her husband A J and sobbed Not only was this sudden crushing debt unfair McCollum later argued to the Education Department she couldn t afford to pay it on her meager teacher s salary And she didn t understand why the department wouldn t turn the loans back into grants since she could prove she was teaching just as she d promised She appealed but was told her loans could not possibly be turned back into grants McCollum was not alone NPR s reporting over the past year found that the same thing was happening to thousands of other public school teachers The problem at the heart of the TEACH Grant story is that small paperwork issues often triggered this catastrophic consequence In order to qualify for a grant aspiring teachers agreed to teach for four years in a low income public school But the rules also required that teachers send in a form every year to prove they were actually teaching The forms were often due over the summer when teachers and principals who had to sign them were away on vacation And if teachers sent in this annual form even one day late missing a signature or date or with any other little problem their TEACH Grants would be turned into loans with interest And this process was irreversible Teachers were told their loans could not be converted back to grants For two years the debt haunted McCollum and her young family They went into forbearance a brief reprieve but with interest accruing They even moved to a smaller less expensive house to prepare for what now seemed inevitable No one was listening Fair or not the debt was growing and would need to be repaid And then just a few Saturdays ago another letter arrived in the mail McCollum opened it in the car her husband driving their young son Louther chirping in the back seat A much needed spring break vacation lay ahead Do you see that word Congratulations McCollum said smiled and laughed It was official That debt now had finally been turned back into grants You re free baby her husband A J said Two years of us fighting this McCollum said We won she tells NPR We raised our voices and they finally heard us Disbelief followed by a relief like I have not felt before The scale of the problem and the fix The federal TEACH Grant program was created in with the best of intentions to help aspiring teachers who committed to teach high need subjects in low income schools pay for college And the program succeeded in attracting bright young teachers to work in some of the nation s most underserved schools According to the most recent data roughly teachers have successfully completed the program s four year teaching requirement But that compares to recipients who have had their grants turned into loans Many of those conversions were justified young students who later decided teaching was not for them and didn t complete their required service But many others were undoubtedly like Kaitlyn McCollum They have taught as promised but were trapped in the program s administrative quicksand In December after multiple NPR reports on the depth of the TEACH Grant problem the Education Department announced it would offer relief for any teacher who could prove they had fulfilled or could still fulfill their teaching service Grants that had unfairly become loans because of these minor paperwork problems would at last become grants again The irreversible became reversible From internal reports from the work that NPR did it was abundantly clear to us that there was a problem with TEACH Grants says the Education Department s Jones who served in the same role in when the TEACH rules were first written We realized that there were certain things that seemed like a good idea when we wrote the regulation but they were just too cumbersome for students And unfairly so The number of teachers getting help is likely to rise According to the department since it rolled out its fix in January nearly teachers have applied for relief So far nearly have been approved for the fix and are getting their loans turned back into grants and fewer than teachers have been denied In short the vast majority of teachers who apply for the fix are getting their grants back Expanding the fix In addition to the department s current relief efforts advocates have also pushed for an overhaul of the TEACH Grant s rules That process known as negotiated rulemaking recently concluded with something of a surprise The department agreed to expand its fix to reach even more teachers and to make the program much easier to navigate Once these new rules go into effect TEACH Grants can no longer be turned into loans just because of late or incomplete annual paperwork So that draconian penalty for such a small infraction will disappear The department is also committing to help teachers who had their credit hurt when they defaulted on these loans But hanging over this process has been one thorny question what to do about teachers who lost their grants and as a result decided to change schools or quit teaching altogether In other words they lost their grants were told there was nothing they could do and so they moved on with their lives On the phone honestly I cried at one point Because I was like this isn t right You know it s not fair remembers Victoria Libsack who taught for three years in a low income Phoenix school But after she narrowly missed a paperwork deadline and her grants were converted to loans Libsack eventually moved to a different state and took a job at a school that doesn t meet TEACH requirements The problem for Libsack and teachers like her is that the program requires four years of teaching within an eight year window Even with the department s initial fix Libsack would have very little time to quit her current job potentially move again and find a new job in a qualifying school to complete her required service And some teachers have no time left at all In February Libsack flew to Washington D C to share her story with the government committee that has been tasked with rewriting the rules Living on a teacher s salary at a low income school I had just enough to live Libsack told the committee I loved teaching but I felt overwhelmed and defeated when my TEACH Grant was converted That rules committee heard Libsack and voted to expand the department s fix to include teachers like her They agreed to go back and pause the eight year clock at the time when a teacher s grants were first converted For Libsack that means she should now have five more years to complete her final year of service She ll still need to change schools to qualify That s not ideal she says but it will mean she won t have to pay upward of in loans Libsack says she s now feeling hopeful because her government finally listened For me as a teacher it s awesome she says because then I can convey that to the students and say Hey you do have a voice You are citizens You do have a role in our government The department s fix has not been entirely smooth Many teachers have told NPR that some call center staff seemed unfamiliar with the new rules and that the paperwork they were sent even after they got approved was really confusing Some advocates argue the department should do even more for teachers like Libsack Patrick Llewellyn an attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group says the government should be more flexible with teachers who lost their grants unfairly many years ago He says it should reduce the number of years they re required to teach in order to satisfy the program s requirements and keep their grants For people who were converted eight nine years ago it is a lot to ask of them to quit their current job and find another one if they are doing something completely different Llewellyn says especially since they are in this position because of how the program has been mishandled But on this point the department is holding firm with the original terms of the deal Teachers have to teach for four years Perhaps the biggest challenge remaining for the Education Department is one of outreach and communication There is relief available for teachers says Llewellyn but they need to know about it Some teachers who were hit with these unfair debts still may not realize they qualify to have them forgiven or refunded if they ve already paid them Many have changed addresses both physical and email and may be difficult to find The department says it is reaching out to make sure those who need the help know that it s finally there It also encourages any teachers who think they might qualify to proactively ask for help Copyright NPR To see more visit https www npr org,"Nearly 2,300 teachers have just had a mountain of student loan debt

389,One could forgive Gray for wanting a little downtime It has not been a small job His tenure has been marked by the aftermath of the financial crisis the eurozone s near meltdown ballooning liabilities and years of sound and fury over cuts to academics pensions At the same time USS has more than doubled its investment staff shifted billions out of stocks and begun snapping up direct ownership stakes in national trophy assets like Heathrow Airport and Thames Water the country s largest water utility Against a fraught backdrop USS s investments have performed well Over the years to March the scheme has returned almost a year on average net of all costs in comparison with a target of a year We have had a pretty good run is how Gray sums up his team s performance It is a typical answer Temperamentally Gray is extremely zen With an ever present genial smile he seems to analyse questions from every angle before replying It has been a busy decade Unlike many the fund manages most of its money in house and the number of investment staff has gone from to It has added new capabilities in credit and emerging markets and formed a specialist strategy team But it is in off market private or alternative investments that Gray leaves his most transformational legacy Pension funds elevated appetite for these assets usually purchased through private equity and infrastructure funds is well known But USS has been at the forefront of UK funds bid to emulate the Canadian model named after the DIY approach pioneered by several of the country s large pension funds Like them USS operates in private markets on more equal terms with the likes of KKR and Blackstone either by investing alongside private equity companies or seeking to source and buy assets for themselves Gray does not pretend this has been easy He says We have gone up a learning curve Take the way people acquire assets in private markets There are quite a lot of assets that come up in auction processes and we have been singularly unsuccessful in auction processes because there is always someone who is willing to pay more than we are Instead USS has had to spend time and money on creating its own deal sourcing team people who have the contacts to bring in deals ahead of the competition The private markets group is quite lawyer intensive Gray observes All of this presumably comes at a price but the scheme says its investment costs amount to of its assets down from in USS s assets have also grown substantially from bn to bn during Gray s tenure That can support a few extra lawyers Critics of USS s investment approach and as the UK s largest pension fund it has many say the scheme is overly cautious They claim it took too long to shift money out of equities and into the bond heavy liability matching strategies adopted by most of the private sector and the result is a bn deficit and cuts in the offing for academics pensions The scheme does have around of its assets today in liability matching index linked gilts and another in lower risk bonds and credit Gray also says the scheme s return has outpaced the a year growth of a model portfolio meant to track its liabilities stating If we had put it all in gilts that is roughly what we would have got But most of the fiery debate around USS is not quite in Gray s remit Pension liabilities have been blown out to tremendous proportions chiefly by two things the fact that we are all living longer and the slump in long term interest rates and bond yields Most defined benefit pensions in the private sector have responded simply by closing their doors In university bosses said they would like to do the same but their scheme is jointly run by university employers and unions and the latter are fiercely opposed Who should pay up to close the scheme s deficit academics or universities is an increasingly bitter wrangle Academics walked out on strike in February and unions have threatened further action this autumn Investing in private assets particularly infrastructure also comes with risk How comfortable is Gray with USS s stake in Thames Water acquired in given the UK opposition Labour Party s plans to nationalise the sector It does put some limit on how much of these regulated assets you want to own in the UK he concedes It had us scratching our heads more than it might have done several years ago I think it would be rather sad if large UK long term investors were deterred from investing in UK infrastructure READ Labour to fight nationalisation battles in court Gray can claim a job well done on diversifying the scheme s investments He joined with a brief to expand USS s alternatives portfolio from to and it is currently sitting around There is one notable exception Back in a key plank of USS s diversification strategy was to put at least of its money even then more than bn into hedge funds It has not worked out that way Gray says this is now less than even after efforts to secure more favourable terms We have done a number of things he says including negotiating the typical management and performance fee structure to somewhere around and respectively What is next for Roger Gray I ask I haven t really been entertaining any conversations about what to do next he muses I anticipate dividing my time There will be something that is food for my soul I think I will take up the oboe

CINCINNATI -- A shareholder sued ABS Industries Inc., charging that
the company misled shareholders by inflating earnings reports and
thereby driving up the stock price. The suit requests class action
classification so that it can represent other shareholders, said Richard
Wayne, an attorney at Strauss & Troy in Cincinnati who represents the
plaintiff.



ABS Industries is a Willoughby, Ohio-based maker of forging
components. On Jan. 10 it announced a litany of financial problems: It
will restate profit for the last three years with lower earnings; it has
been incorrectly counting sales; it failed to meet the conditions of its
$56.6 million in loans as well as its $6.5 million in state financing;
its fourth-quarter 1995 loss is expected to be bigger than the
previously announced $2.5 million; and a proposed acquisition fell
through. As a result, ABS Industries relieved its comptroller of his
duties, pending the investigation of an outside auditing firm.

remaining Pounds to fund an early retirement But Janet is having none of it he says She sees me as a young man and thinks I should work into my sixties Michael earns Pounds gross while Janet a part time classroom assistant earns Pounds They have a nine year old daughter Lucy The Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund a final salary scheme will pay Michael Pounds a year from age Janet does not have any pension provision beyond the state pension We would like to invest the Pounds to boost our eventual retirement income Michael says I would like a spread of risk A maturing endowment with Standard Life paid off their mortgage last year They were persuaded to start a new investment of Pounds a month in Standard Life s Global Advantage Fund They can afford to save a further Pounds a month and have Pounds in a savings account with Portman Building Society We asked a panel of financial advisers where they thought Michael and Janet should invest their windfall WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY Mark Dampier head of research Hargreaves Lansdown Michael and Janet should keep most of their money in cash until they have settled into their new home This gives them flexibility and they can always invest later There are two things that they need to do before they tie up any money in long term investments The first is to work out a detailed budget so that they have a better idea of how much retirement income they will need The second is to properly assess their attitude to risk Many investors say low risk when they really mean no risk They should seek the services of an independent financial adviser Avoid tied advisers such as the one from Standard Life because they can only advise on their company s products They are also unlikely to provide lifestyle type planning While considering the relatively short term goal of retiring in seven years time they should also work on the basis that they will want capital growth and income for another years Simply putting the entire amount in the building society and living off the interest is not a particularly great long term plan I would earmark Pounds for UK equity income funds such as Artemis Income Liontrust Income Invesco Perpetual Income Framlington Equity Income Credit Suisse Alpha Income and Jupiter Income I would put a further Pounds into distribution funds that combine both fixed interest and equities such as New Star and Invesco Perpetual and Pounds in three investment trusts I would keep the remaining Pounds in cash accounts using cash mini Isas first and then an ordinary account such as the ING Direct account Anna Bowes investment manager Chase de Vere I agree with Janet If Michael were to retire early they would probably struggle financially both now and in the future Everyone should keep some money in cash for emergencies and short term expenses but as you near retirement cash holdings should be increased I would put the extra Pounds a month into cash savings The Portman does not pay the best rates but there is always the chance of a demutualisation windfall Turning to investment a low risk portfolio would suggest that they invest heavily into fixed interest cash and property with a far smaller proportion in stocks and shares A division to consider would be per cent cash per cent fixed interest per cent property and per cent UK equities A slightly higher risk portfolio would make tactical sense because the price of equities is comparatively low at the moment I would therefore consider equity investments of per cent UK per cent US per cent European and per cent Far East The rest could be per cent cash per cent fixed interest and per cent property It is important to review a portfolio annually Standard Life Global Advantage is a mediocre performer Their holding could be transferred at no charge perhaps to Standard Life s Corporate Bond fund Brian Dennehy managing director Dennehy Weller Co It is perfectly understandable that Michael and Janet wish to be cautious Their capital is particularly valuable because it is earmarked for a key purpose retirement income in as few as seven years Furthermore the investment and economic background is fragile and will remain so for years to come The older you are the less risk you should take on I believe that the lower risk portion of a portfolio should be equal to your age in this case per cent Michael and Janet may feel more comfortable with per cent The other per cent could be a mix of medium risk such as UK equity income funds and high risk such as smaller companies or the Far East However I would prefer an investment period of no less than ten years for the Far East Rachel Faulkner pensions strategist Torquil Clark Michael should take into consideration that penalties could apply if he took pension benefits from his scheme before the normal retirement date He should obtain details He does not seem to be aware that he is likely to receive a tax free lump sum at retirement It is normally advisable to take this option and reinvest tax efficiently However this depends on personal circumstances Do not forget about the state pension A forecast of benefits can be obtained by completing a BR form available from www thepensionservice gov uk I do not see much point in putting the property windfall into pensions They are close to retirement and may even retire early Remember to invest in Janet s name too because she is the lower earner LINKS Hargreaves Lansdown www hargreaveslansdown co uk Torquil Clark www tqonline co uk Chase de Vere Financial Solutions www chasedevere co uk Dennehy Weller Co www dwcifa com MICHAEL S RESPONSE I am so glad I wrote in I did not expect to receive so much in depth advice There is a lot to mull over I realise that I should probably leave high risk investments alone I also need to do a lot of research before I invest and I need to understand pensions better The comments about the Standard Life fund confirm my disappointment The return so far has been pathetic I am glad we did not put in half as much as the salesman wanted We are looking forward to the move I have seen the world but Janet wants to travel and we will be able to afford it now I have already bought a snooker cue and taken up water skiing We will have more time and money to go out and do things together as a family We ve had a great time at the cottage but life is increasingly

408,THE RULING MOSTLY TRUE In a speech attacking her opponent Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump cheered while the economy reeled in the aftermath of Britain s shocking vote to leave the European Union On Friday when Britain voted to leave the European Union he crowed from his golf course about how the disruption could end up creating higher profits for that golf course even though within hours Americans lost billion from our k s Clinton said in Ohio June He tried to turn a global economics challenge into an infomercial Trump did say last week that Brexit would benefit Turnberry his golf course in Scotland because a weaker pound would bring more tourists We wondered though about the other part of Clinton s claim that Brexit caused million Americans with k retirement savings accounts to lose billion in just hours The nitty gritty Most k accounts are tied at least in part to the stock market And the market took a pretty big hit from the British referendum with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping percent and the S P index falling percent However we couldn t find an ongoing daily log of the total value of Americans k s The Investment Company Institute puts the figure at trillion as of March The Clinton campaign explained to us how they calculated that billion figure and experts told us the reasoning was sound Basically the campaign took that March figure for the total value of all k accounts trillion and calculated any growth through June the day before the Brexit vote and then the subsequent fall They based the growth on changes in the U S stock market as stocks account for about percent of k assets and fixed income which accounts for percent Their end result An estimated drop of billion in k assets from June to June Click here to see the full explanation of the campaign s math The campaign approached this analysis correctly said Wade Pfau an expert in retirement finance and founder of RetirementResearcher com They may have even underestimated the loss by assuming all stocks are U S stocks International stocks fell a lot further he said But certainly I think their analysis is a fair and reasonable assessment about the extent of the impact on k s Jack VanDerHei research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute also said the campaign s calculation was a decent approximation of k losses after the Brexit vote Running his own numbers he came up with an estimated billion loss Experts said though that average k account holders don t need to panic The big picture The number sounds big but it is a small percent of the total and it is not as though this money is lost forever Pfau said Four days after the Brexit vote the U S stock market is starting to stabilize and creep back up Consequently so are the values of Americans k s Spokesmen at k providers Charles Schwab and Fidelity told us they had received many calls from account holders worried about their assets following the Brexit vote They both said they encourage clients to stay the course and remember that saving for retirement is a long term investment that shouldn t be irreparably harmed by last week s market volatility Generally k accounts belonging to younger people have a higher concentration of stocks in order to maximize growth for as long as possible But as account holders get closer to retirement they should reduce that concentration effectively reducing their accounts exposure to market volatility said Fidelity spokesman Mike Shamrell People who have the most stock in k are those who will be impacted the most so young people Shamrell said But they ve got the longest until they retire so years and years and years to make it up Alternatively if someone were to sell some of his or her assets amid the post Brexit vote market turmoil that would permanently lock in some of their losses Pfau said Our ruling After Britain s vote to leave the European Union within hours Americans lost billion from our k s Clinton said Experts told us that Clinton s calculation was a reasonable approximation of the loss of k assets amid market turmoil following the Brexit vote That being said those losses are very likely impermanent k accounts are long term investments designed to withstand brief shocks like this The claim is accurate but needs additional information so we rate Clinton s claim Mostly True About this

409,Time was running out All of their efforts to convince the mortgage company to rework their loan visits to nonprofit agencies offers for short sales and mediation had been rejected So you had to wonder Why not simply give up I want to save my home Odalys DeBlasio said We have nowhere else to go her husband Bill said Homeowners who face foreclosure are finding that the lifelines touted by the government and industry are providing little help leaving them in a perpetual state of uncertainty It prompted the Obama administration last week to once again prod mortgage companies to work with distressed homeowners But for now the foreclosure problem remains a weight on the economy And it s causing homeowners to throw up their hands in frustration This large wave of foreclosures is like shoveling sand against the tide Rutgers University economist Joseph J Seneca said People are having difficulty making mortgage payments At the same time prices decline At the same time job losses continue It just feeds on itself The problem stems from homeowners who earlier in the decade were approved for loans that they couldn t afford The loans were so pervasive that once homeowners defaulted it set off a chain of events that eventually sparked a global recession The government intervened It spent billions of taxpayer dollars to prevent banks from failing And it launched several programs that encouraged lenders to modify the mortgages and keep borrowers in their homes The modification programs have made little more than a dent Only percent of seriously delinquent loans nationwide have been modified according to a report released earlier this month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston And New Jersey has had even less luck The state in January introduced the Mortgage Stabilization Program offering lenders up to to help them modify mortgages as long as the lenders wrote down the loan to the current value So far not a single mortgage has been modified No lender has stated to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency why they aren t using the program and we would rather not speculate about their reasons said Lisa Ryan a spokeswoman for the agency The answer might be as simple as money Banks need to make a profit in order to stay in business and when they start writing down the value or amount of the mortgage they are taking a hit to the bottom line said James Silkensen co president and co chief executive officer of the New Jersey Bankers Association a trade group The result Millions of homeowners nationwide know how the DeBlasios feel The DeBlasios moved from Florida to Middletown and bought a home in March in a wooded enclave where all of the streets are named after birds Nine months later with their home appraised for they refinanced took cash out and planned to buy a gasoline station in Lakewood It left them with a loan The interest rate started at percent They sent payments of to America s Servicing Co a mortgage servicer owned by Wells Fargo They don t know who owns the loan And the interest rate has since jumped to percent Mortgage servicers collect monthly payments and keep track of homeowner accounts The loans can be bought and sold many times over And as in the case of the DeBlasios it s not always clear where the loan ends up It wasn t long before the DeBlasios financial security was thrown into disarray The gasoline station s owner backed out they said And Bill DeBlasio got sick and eventually was diagnosed with an enlarged heart Quickly they found themselves without enough income to keep up with the always growing mortgage payments They put their home up for sale in late but by then the housing market was beginning to topple And the DeBlasios were stuck A buyer offered to purchase their home for a so called short sale that would require the lender to take less than it is owed They went to loan counselors for as many as five nonprofit agencies that had been tabbed to help homeowners modify their loans They went to a mediator at the Monmouth County Hall of Records Each time they said America s Servicing Co rejected their bid Meanwhile they read about new programs introduced by the Obama administration that were designed to give mortgage companies more incentive to modify their loans Certain they qualified the DeBlasios called and e mailed America s Servicing Co They ve been asked to send and re send documents Still their home is scheduled to be sold at a sheriff s sale for foreclosed properties on Aug We qualify for a modification Bill DeBlasio said Why do I get turned down for that Why are you turning me down for these programs A spokesman for Wells Fargo said in an e mail When working with homeowners who have loans originated by other lenders we must follow the guidelines established by the loan s investors Our goal is to help every struggling homeowner find a monthly payment that is manageable and we have been successful in doing so with more than such modifications this year alone Regrettably we are not able to help everyone The slow pace of mortgage modifications has left some industry officials frustrated Joel Greenberg chief executive officer of Novadebt a Freehold Township credit counselor hosted President George W Bush in March to introduce Hope Now the first government endorsed program that encouraged lenders to work with borrowers Greenberg said the program hasn t been very effective alleviating foreclosures And the number of homeowners in distress has only risen as layoffs have increased and home values have dropped he said Obama s plan came down to the same equation Greenberg said The servicers pretty much voluntarily provide modifications There have not been any programs that force them to do something under certain conditions The outcome even with a voluntary program could come as a surprise Many observers thought lenders would jump at the chance to modify loans instead of wade through the costly foreclosure process But David Petrovich executive director of the Society for the Preservation of Continued Homeownership a nonprofit group in Ocean Township said many mortgage holders have been stalling as long as they can unwilling to settle for a loss And there is little incentive for them to make a concession particularly if they have insurance on their investment The lender will only do what is in its best financial self interest Petrovich said Even though it doesn t make sense to us they know what they are doing The slow pace of mortgage modifications hasn t escaped the Obama administration s notice Officials said they are working with servicers to ramp up their staff improve training and make decisions more efficiently And at a U S Senate Banking hearing last week Assistant Treasury Secretary Herbert M Allison said the government will begin publicly reporting results of the servicing companies modifications on Aug A sheriff s sale has been scheduled for the DeBlasios home six days later For now Odalys DeBlasio works in the bakery department at Whole Foods Bill DeBlasio bought a cleaning franchise and wonders where he can find the money to invest in his fledgling company And they have looked at homes to rent They recently found two When they asked their year old son which one they should choose he said Which one will allow us to stay the longest Odalys DeBlasio said Michael L Diamond or

411,But starting in your s this same emphasis should be applied to finances so that by the time the wrinkles of life start appearing job loss health issues college expenses a disaster or early retirement your nest egg won t show wear and tear Donna Jordan Pensacola Certified Financial Planner who is recognized nationally by financial publications offers some suggestions to protect your and your nest egg Although no two people have identical circumstances most of us are able to recognize certain financial stages in our lives she said At each stage there are different financial needs and different strategies to meet those needs IN YOUR S Generally your education and job training will be your primary investments during these years You will be establishing a career and possibly a family But this is also the time to establish the foundation of your financial future You should start with a basic financial plan and a budget by balancing your spending and savings within the boundaries of your income level Expensive debt such as credit cards should be reduced or eliminated Establish reasonable savings goals These should include establishing an emergency reserve equal to three to six months living expenses as well as starting to save for retirement While retirement may seem far in the distance it is important to start saving early Each dollar saved in your s can be worth ten times as much as a dollar saved in your s Make sure to take advantage of company sponsored retirement plans Save a little bit with every paycheck Your goal should be to contribute enough to capture all of the available employer s matching contributions Beyond that if you have additional dollars that can be saved for retirement you should contribute to a Roth per year so long as you meet the income eligibility requirements Be sure to utilize any other employee benefits available to you Health life and disability insurance are generally more affordable when purchased as a part of your employment group Be sure to have at least a basic estate plan to include a will and written medical directives The investments you select for your retirement plan or IRA should be growth oriented and include both domestic and non domestic stocks and bonds All investments carry a risk of one type or another so you must think through your own tolerance for various types of risk Educate yourself Learn the basics but seek professional help as needed with your investments taxes and accounting IN YOUR S S These are generally the prime spending years Mortgage payments child care expenses and other living expenses may seem overwhelming By now you should begin to identify a specific retirement goal that is when you hope to retire how much you will need to live on in retirement and what amount of savings and rate of return on your investments will be necessary for you to achieve your goal You should continue to increase your short term and long term savings Each time you receive a raise a portion of it should be allocated to savings When changing jobs you should never cash out your k It should be rolled over into your new company s plan or into an IRA When saving for college you may wish to consider Section plans for extra tax advantages It is also important to be sure that you have in place a secure risk management safety net in the form of proper insurance that will protect you and your family from loss of life loss of income due to illness or injury property loss due to catastrophe or liability and expenses for healthcare Your estate plan must be kept current For example make sure that beneficiary designations on retirement plans IRAs annuities and life insurance policies are kept current and that any family changes such as divorce death or births are reflected in your plans Investments should continue to be growth oriented and as your investment portfolio grows you will be able to add additional diversification to your holdings IN YOUR S S With middle age comes a shift in your financial focus from spending to saving As you approach retirement each financial decision you make grows in importance Generally by this time children are grown and supporting themselves Most people find themselves in their highest earning years This allows budgets and financial plans to be modified to allocate maximum flow to retirement savings Now is also the time to determine if you are on course to achieving your retirement goal or if you will fall short This is also the time to review your estate plan for tax efficiency and for potential gifting or charitable intent You should also consider the purchase of long term care insurance when appropriate Although growth is still important investment allocations should be modified to reflect a more conservative allocation as you start to acquire investments that will provide income in retirement YOUR RETIREMENT Retirement brings its own set of financial decisions Securing a stable income will become your main objective Primary sources of income are now Social Security employer sponsored retirement plans income from personal savings distributions from IRAs and wages from part time employment Your plan will now focus on how to structure your distributions from retirement plans and other investments to maximize returns and minimize taxes Your budget should be modified to reflect any lifestyle changes including increased travel a relocation to down size or move closer to family and elimination of mortgage debt etc Your investment portfolio should now be structured to maximize income This can be done through the careful selection of income producing securities such as annuities bonds certificates of deposit investment trusts and dividend paying stocks All insurance policies and estate planning vehicles should be reviewed and modified as needed It is never too late or too early to start to plan your financial future,"Taris Savell

425,The wily Dr Mahathir he s a physician may be but he insists in conversation that that s merely his chronological age biological age is quite different He seems perhaps a decade younger I m still myself he says still able to function He returned to office in a cathartic May election which swept out incumbent Najib Razak regarded by many including the U S Justice Department as exceptionally corrupt While it would be an exaggeration to say that Dr Mahathir is contrite about the autocratic way in which his critics believe he governed from to he does have a few regrets There were criticisms against the time when I was prime minister for years he says in his suite at the Plaza Hotel and I find some of the criticisms are worth looking into Now he adds I have the benefit of all this experience years working with the opposition But I will do things only slightly differently Otherwise a lot of the old policies and strategies are still relevant today Dr Mahathir admits that one of the things that they criticized me about was that I had cronies and that I helped my cronies He argues that criticism is unfair that those people received his favor because they were able to do things I tend to support people who are capable who have shown some achievements This results oriented approach to doing business he believes was misunderstood But now since I am governing with the people who used to criticize me I want to show them that I m not what they think I am Those new partners include Anwar Ibrahim leader of the People s Justice Party or PKR which has seats in Malaysia s member Parliament the most of any party Mr Anwar was Dr Mahathir s prot g and Malaysia s finance minister but the two fell out acridly in The following year Mr Anwar was tried convicted and imprisoned Dr Mahathir leads the Alliance of Hope coalition of which Mr Anwar s PKR is the spearhead The prime minister s party Bersatu has only of the coalition s parliamentary seats Dr Mahathir s status as the foremost politician of modern Malaysia might have made him the obvious choice to lead the coalition into elections Yet he did so also because Mr Anwar was still in prison on a second iteration of the sodomy charges for which he was first jailed by Dr Mahathir in The coalition campaigned on the understanding that Dr Mahathir would be prime minister for two years after which he would cede office to Mr Anwar It was also understood that the latter would receive a pardon and be released from prison as he was Will Dr Mahathir stick to the promise of a transition of power to Mr Anwar Well there have been a lot of people who mention two years he says but I am supposed to be the interim prime minister It may be two years it may be one year It may be three years I wouldn t know Pressed to clarify he remains cryptic I didn t know what to say but I believe that after two years he will take over Does Dr Mahathir regret the legal action against Mr Anwar in the late s Well I don t know about regretting he responds but at that time it was done by a court of law The trial lasted nine months All kinds of evidence was produced and the court decided It s not me So people will blame me for that but I don t interfere with the courts His critics he says want to take a political view of Mr Anwar s imprisonment I was not the best liked leader in the Western world because I m critical about other wrongdoings elsewhere he was famously outspoken against Israel so the moment they find reason to blame me they will Dr Mahathir suggests he could have resorted to Malaysia s Internal Security Act which allowed the government to detain a person without trial I didn t do that He went to the courts Asked if Mr Anwar s succession would be good for Malaysia Dr Mahathir says well that is what the people want It s not a question of what I like If the people want that they will have it How does Mr Anwar feel about his erstwhile jailer He seems to be quite nice Dr Mahathir says He sees me we talk to each other We didn t discuss about old things because we decided that those things are the past and we can t look at the past We have to look ahead As for the sodomy law Dr Mahathir says his government will not repeal it We are a Muslim nation and we do not tolerate sodomy The rest of the world may tolerate it but we cannot That is against our religion Dr Mahathir doesn t like the way radical Islam is commonly described in the West In Malaysia we believe that what we practice is Islamic fundamentalism If you go according to the teachings of Islam you will be able to set up a good society a good government You will not be oppressive What the West calls Islamist fundamentalism he says is a deviation from the teachings of Islam It s not Islam at all We have some people in Malaysia who are attracted to these deviations but we have been able to argue against them And by and large the people support us He alludes to his recent criticism of a Shariah court in the Malaysian state of Terengganu which ordered the caning of a lesbian couple It s not a moderate position he says of his own disapproval of the court it s an Islamic position I mean in Islam there is tolerance We have to be merciful and compassionate There are other forms of punishment It s not necessary to cane these people so we objected to that It gives a very bad impression of Islam He has said the two women should have had to undergo counseling not caning Another contentious facet of modern Malaysia is its entrenched system of racial preferences Ethnic Malays the Sons of the Soil in local parlance receive notable advantages over citizens of Chinese and Indian origin in jobs and educational opportunities Will the New Mahathir as Malaysians now describe him reset his country toward a goal of equality and genuine pluralism Will the idea of Malay dominance diminish There is no Malay dominance Dr Mahathir says quickly before launching into an explanation of how he sees his country s political demography The problem is we have three major communities and the wealth of the country is not evenly distributed between the three So we have to correct that If not he continues there will be tension as a result of the big disparity between rich and poor And if the rich belong to one race and the poor belong to another race then the potential for tension and conflict will be much greater The rich are Malaysia s Chinese and to a lesser extent its Indians the poor are the Malays What we did was to favor the poorer people so as to be able to catch up with the rich That is affirmative action Naturally affirmative action means that you have to discriminate against one group in favor of the other If you don t do that there can never be any changes in the disparities He intends however to effect one change Dr Mahathir plans to crack down on the widespread practice whereby Malay beneficiaries resell to businessmen of other races contracts they ve been awarded based on affirmative action We have to make sure that if we give a contract to the deprived community then they cannot sell or transfer the contract to anybody else If they do then the contract becomes invalid Dr Mahathir says he also is determined to address the more profound issues of corruption that bedevil his country These include the relentless prosecution of his predecessor Mr Najib who stands accused of gargantuan theft from a state owned fund known as MDB I believe that if the leader is not corrupt then the level of corruption will not be very high Dr Mahathir says What happened was that the prime minister himself was totally corrupt openly corrupt and because of that corruption spread throughout the whole government machinery and the business community There will be no amnesty deal with Mr Najib Dr Mahathir insists He claims he can explain everything that he didn t take the money And that is up to the judge to evaluate his defense against the prosecutor s evidence A legacy of the Najib years is a series of contracts with China which critics and economists believe will leave Malaysia deeply indebted Dr Mahathir has put most of these projects worth around billion in total on hold On a visit to Beijing in August he startled his hosts by speaking of a new version of colonialism an allusion to China s galloping economic expansion In New York Dr Mahathir says that the press put those words into my mouth I didn t say that even as there are YouTube clips online that show him uttering those words in the presence of an open mouthed Li Keqiang the Chinese premier In what appears to be a quibble over words Dr Mahathir insists that he meant neocolonialism in the sense that Sukarno said after independence Sukarno was Indonesia s president from Dr Mahathir says that any attempt to gain control of our country is a form of colonialism So we do not want that I wasn t specifically saying it about China He adds that it is the duty of an independent country to retain its independence by whatever means possible The Chinese projects involve huge borrowings and we cannot repay that money he says So the best thing to do is to drop the project But of course we have made agreements with them If unilaterally we drop the project we have to pay compensation so instead we proposed a postponement or a reduction in the scale The Chinese haven t said no so far They are listening to what we are proposing His own relationship with the giant neighbor to Malaysia s north isn t Dr Mahathir s only worry He doesn t like the growing hostility between the U S and China Confrontation I think isn t going to be good for anyone he muses referring to the presence of U S warships in the South China Sea It s far better to talk and discuss things rather than to send battleships to show your dislike for whatever move that the countries there make Donald Trump appears to disconcert Dr Mahathir who laughs nervously when asked about the American president We cannot make out what the presidency is like because he changes his mind sometimes three times in one day It s very unsettling because how do you deal with a person who is not consistent This is our worry Malaysia s previous prime minister says Dr Mahathir tried to bribe President Trump by offering to buy aircraft and all that He actually said he wanted to help the economy of the United States Malaysia is a small country We can t help people Mr Varadarajan is executive editor at Stanford University s Hoover Institution,"New York

Even in a city swarming with statesmen and panjandrums from every nook of the globeâ€”all gathered here for the annual meeting of the United Nations General Assemblyâ€”Mahathir Mohamad stands out as exceptional. That he is the world's oldest head of government is almost prosaic compared with the magnitude and audacity of his political reinvention. After 15 years out of power, he's back as prime minister of Malaysia for a second time. Now he is ruling in a courteous (and remarkable) coalition with a man he once sent to prison for sodomy and abuse of power on charges widely accepted to have been trumped up and politically motivated.",0,

430,There is a catch though In order to maintain his or her standard of living in retirement the year old must continue to work until age In contrast a year old who consistently saves per year is likely to be able to afford to retire by age Part of the explanation has to do with Social Security By putting off retirement until age an individual would receive a benefit that is higher than what he or she could claim at age the earliest date of eligibility Postponing retirement also gives k s and other retirement savings accounts additional years to grow And it shortens the amount of time a nest egg must last To make it easier to meet your target savings rate take advantage of any matching contributions your employer offers in a k or other workplace retirement plan And beware of shortcuts In a bid to boost retirement savings some may be inclined to ramp up exposure to equities in the hope of earning a higher return over time But such a move will expose them to greater downside risk without delivering much additional retirement security should stocks fare well According to Boston College a year old who sets aside of his or her pay and earns a rate of return will be able to retire at age a rate of return lowers the age to approximately Email next wsj com,"When it comes to saving for retirement, many Americans are playing catch-up.

435,The Innovative Finance IF Isa allows individuals to invest in peer to peer P P loans through the account and earn higher rates of interest than are available on the high street A P P loan is an investment where an individual lends money to another person or a business through a middleman service In return they are paid a set rate of interest for the duration of the loan and promised the return of their initial investment at the end Such investments have grown in popularity since the financial crisis because interest rates on bank and building society accounts have been so low As a result savers have had to look elsewhere for a decent return on their money The attraction of investing in P P loans is that the regular interest payments at higher rates mean you should get a more reliable return than if you invested in the stock market which can be volatile However sceptics point out that because this is a relatively new type of investment it is not yet clear how safe it is or what will happen in a recession should the number of borrowers defaulting on their loans start to ramp up Some P P providers have a safeguard fund which is designed to pay out in the event of this happening and many also split your investment across a number of different loans and in small chunks to protect you from being over exposed to defaults This is important because losses are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme As P P lending has become more popular though the interest rates on offer have come down The market leading P P platforms Zopa and RateSetter typically pay and respectively on their standard accounts Rates can be higher if you are willing to take more chances in the pursuit of bigger returns Zopa for example offers to those who opt for its higher risk account Zopa Plus Downing Crowd a rival platform says its returns range from all the way up to Another issue is that as demand from investors outstrips that from borrowers the former may have to wait for several days or even weeks before their money is matched to a lender and they can start earning the interest A further concern is that as P P providers have grown they have become less discerning in who they lend to In its first year for example Zopa approved only of the personal loan applications it received according to the peer to peer comparison site thWay Today it approves about of applications Default rates are low but have risen among the ranks of the borrowers on the books of many P P platforms This is partly a result of slowing economic growth rising interest rates and Brexit uncertainty having a big impact on the finances of business and individuals However Julia Groves co founder of Downing Crowd thinks that all these factors make IF Isas more appealing Political uncertainty is beginning to weigh on financial markets and cash is not quite the safe haven it once was as many savers have suffered years of low interest rates and high inflation At times such as these diversification is important and that is where the IF Isa can come in The take up so far has been muted though In its first year only IF Isas were opened and m subscribed In investors put m into accounts While that was a big jump Lifetime Isas were launched in and accounts were opened in its first year with m subscribed One of the reasons for the lower demand is that the IF Isa can be a little more restrictive than other Isas You can open only one of each type of Isa in each tax year but with a stocks and shares account you should still have access to the thousands of investment funds available in the UK If you open an IF Isa with a P P provider you will have access only to the loans on that platform That reduces the chances of finding what you may see as good borrowers paying good rates and also means that you run the risk of not spreading your bets widely enough While you can transfer an existing Isa balance into an IF Isa you cannot simply move existing P P loans into another IF Isa you must start afresh with new loans in the account Furthermore if you want to move from one P P provider to another it may be that the original platform can sell the loans you hold to the new provider but this will involve a fee and will depend on which companies you deal with Neil Faulkner co founder of thWay said Peer to peer lending is very stable compared to the stock market especially when you stick to the lower risk bread and butter types of loans The biggest risk is when investors do not grasp the need to spread their money across a lot of different providers and a very large number of loans to mitigate the risk of bad debts To reduce that risk it is important to research the provider you are using and to understand what sort of borrowers are on the platform Check the difference between the interest rate the borrower pays and the rate you are paid as a lender the gap between the two will show how large a slice the provider is taking as the middle man Higher rates of interest are tempting but tend to indicate greater risk If you are cherry picking individual loans to invest in rather than choosing a provider that spreads your money make sure you do your homework on that borrower Even with this approach however you should still take on a number of different loans so you do not run the risk of losing everything should one borrower default on its debt With these individual loans those that are asset backed or secured may be less risky as there will be an asset perhaps a property that the lender can sell in the event they are facing a default,"A new type of Isa lets you into the world of peerâ€‘toâ€‘peer loans â€” and higher returns. Holly Black looks at the pros and cons

Once upon a time there was just cash or shares. More racy types of investment were allowed only in specialist products, usually reserved for the well-off. Then, in April 2016, a new type of Isa came along that allowed investors to tap into a different, dynamic part of the financial sector.",0,
436,Some fairly complicated facts led to the arrest The story begins with a year old student loan debt for that Aker never paid The Department of Education tries to collect such debts and can even garnish your wages to do it But when it doesn t succeed the department hands such uncollected debts to the Department of Justice That s what happened to Aker The Justice Department is busy too So it contracts with a private lawyer to sue you for the money you owe Aker s case was brought on behalf of the federal government by a Houston lawyer with a name Butch Cersonsky that couldn t be improved upon even by Elmore Leonard patron literary saint of debt collectors everywhere Back in Cersonsky filed a federal suit against Aker on behalf of the government Ordinarily a debt collection suit would be in state court But because Aker owed money to the federal government the federal court had jurisdiction You can see where the U S marshals are going to come in When Aker didn t show up to contest the case the federal court issued a default judgment against him That s normal enough and wouldn t have gotten anyone arrested But the federal government acting through Cersonsky wasn t done It asked the court to order Aker to show up and to find Aker in contempt of court if he didn t The decision to find Aker in contempt and then to issue a warrant for his arrest was within the court s discretion It s unusual for a court to order the arrest of someone who hasn t shown up to contest a civil suit but it can happen It s thus technically correct to say that Aker wasn t arrested for defaulting on his debt but for flouting a court order But it s also true that the arrest flowed directly from his debt default Will the incident be repeated Very possibly the answer is yes It would make sense for Congress to pass a law barring arrests for contempt on defaulted debt cases and for states to follow suit The loss to judicial authority would be incidental The gain to liberty would be considerable Short of that the Justice Department should tell its designated collection agent lawyers not to use strong arm tactics in the name of we the people A department rule to that effect might be sufficient Failure to pay a debt shouldn t lead you to jail no matter what the route Noah Feldman a Bloomberg View columnist is a professor of constitutional and international law at Harvard noah feldman,"A Houston man, Paul Aker, was recently arrested by U.S. marshals and hauled into federal court on charges that stemmed from his failure to pay a $1,500 student loan. How could this happen in a free country?

We're used to thinking that what makes a civil case different from a criminal one is that you can't go to jail. But that isn't exactly true. If you fail to show up in court after you've been ordered to do so, the judge can issue a warrant for your arrest on contempt of court â€“ which is a crime. In the light of Aker's case and the viral attention it received, it's worth asking both why an arrest doesn't happen more often and whether the system ought to be changed so that it can't.",1,
437,Firms say that investors can find comfort in these new funds knowing that losses will be minimized and risk awareness increased But critics point to the higher fees and lack of a track record for some of these portfolios and question the need to tinker with established investing formulas I m quite skeptical of any fund that says you can have your cake and eat it too said Leo Marzen partner at New York based wealth manager Bridgewater Advisors Inc Among the new style mutual funds launched this year are so called absolute return funds from Putnam Investments a unit of Great West Lifeco Inc GWO CA and the AIM Balanced Risk Allocation Fund ABRZX US an asset allocation fund from Invesco Ltd IVZ US that invests according to risk management techniques In April Legg Mason Inc LM US launched Legg Mason Permal Tactical Allocation Fund LPTAX US the first mutual fund managed by its Permal fund of hedge funds affiliate Absolute return is a strategy that shoots for positive returns regardless of market conditions The problem say critics is twofold There s not much wrong with mainstream investing strategies that a tweaking of asset allocations can t fix and was such a bad year that everything suffered A lot of this is just a reminder that really nothing worked last year said John Coumarianos a mutual fund analyst at investment researcher Morningstar Inc Treasurys were the only thing that held up New and unproved Both Putnam and Invesco officials told MarketWatch that their new funds follow risk managed investment strategies that institutional clients have used for a long time Legg Mason added that its fund is designed to outperform other balanced offerings But regulations prevent firms from disclosing institutional performance and without a public track record investors in fact don t know what to expect For example said Ryan Leggio a Morningstar mutual fund analyst We re not even sure how AIM Balanced Risk Allocation fits in an investor s portfolio How can they say it s better than traditional balanced funds when they re still offering their own balanced fund Whether to own a balanced fund or an absolute return fund is a matter of individual preference said Scott Wolle manager of the AIM fund He said the fund could be used as a core holding noting that once the fund is available in his firm s retirement plan he will put all of his retirement savings into it Diversification is a key part of the strategy Wolle added with the portfolio split about equally among stocks bonds and commodities Morningstar s Leggio credits Invesco for the fund s diversification as well as commodities it has more international stock holdings than other balanced funds but he s concerned about its fees of higher than the median fee for a conservative asset allocation fund This fund will absolutely perform differently from other balanced funds Leggio said but will the commodities sleeve add value over or years At Putnam meanwhile Chief Executive Bob Reynolds has been the driver behind development of the firm s absolute return funds Morningstar analysts gave particularly scathing reviews of the Putnam effort The absolute return funds show a lot about Putnam s sales and marketing driven culture said Jonathan Rahbar a Morningstar fund analyst It s really a tough promise Reynolds sees it differently What Morningstar may not be aware of is that high net worth and institutional investors have used absolute return strategies successfully for years he said adding that Putnam has used the strategies for institutional clients for a decade Ben Alpert hedge fund analyst at Morningstar said many hedge funds promise absolute returns but those promises were worthless in a tough market last year The Morningstar Hedge Fund Index was down about in roughly percentage points better than the Standard Poor s stock index SPX US but a long way from positive Losses of were about the same as those suffered from traditional balanced mutual funds according to Morningstar I get concerned whenever I hear the phrase absolute return Alpert added Many hedge funds that have claimed absolute return strategies are very dependent on leverage and even if they do well for a while they tend to blow up after a few years That s an inflammatory statement Reynolds said These types of strategies have been used for a number of years and many haven t blown up Reynolds said Putnam s absolute return funds don t use leverage Echoing Invesco s Wolle Reynolds said there s a greater appetite among retail investors for new and different strategies Not chasing relative returns is a good idea for any investor he added noting that most institutional investors have to allocated to absolute return strategies A allocation to such strategies he said offers an anchor in the wind Changing approach For investors who want to make major portfolio shifts Morningstar s Coumarianos said a reasonable approach would be to alter their allocation to stocks and bonds In a recent article Russ Kinnel director of mutual fund research at Morningstar named five funds he believes offer potentially strong returns with less downside than pure stock funds Kinnel chose balanced offerings Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund VWINX US down in and Manning Napier Pro Blend Moderate Term Fund EXBAX US which lost in Other picks included Vanguard Convertible Fund VCVSX US which invests in convertible bonds and lost last year and FPA Crescent Fund FPACX US a go anywhere vehicle that can be long or short in stocks hold bonds or cash and was down in Kinnel also named Matthews Asian Growth Income MACSX US an income focused emerging markets fund that lost last year after being up in Notably each of these funds is a traditional mutual fund that invests in stocks and bonds and aside from the FPA fund uses mainly long only strategies There s really no reason to stray from what we ve known for the past years when it comes to investing Morningstar s Rahbar added As long as investors can maintain a long term focus they should benefit in the long run,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- After last year's market meltdown savaged just about every U.S. and international asset class,

A: An offset mortgage pulls together all your loans and savings into one pot. You only pay interest on the difference between the amount you are borrowing and the amount you are saving.  

The major advantage is that instead of receiving a separate interest rate on your savings - which is normally much lower than the mortgage rate you are paying - you simply pay a reduced level of interest on the mortgage.  ",0,

453,The Problem Gina is confident she has enough assets to retire But she is a risk averse investor and isn t sure if her portfolio matches her tolerance level She would like part of her investments to be guaranteed even if it means lower rates of return She s also having second thoughts about her investment property The prospect of becoming a landlord and dealing with the tenants and the current volatility of the real estate market make her uneasy The Particulars Assets Condo Investment property Non registered investments RRSP Locked in Retirement Account Tax Free Savings Account Liabilities Future investment property mortgage to be paid off completely next year using investments The Plan Gina should look at all the options available to her and select only the ones that make the most sense to her not ones that seem trendy says Robyn Thompson a financial planner at Castlemark Wealth Management in Toronto Real estate holdings make up the remaining per cent of Gina s assets Gina s intention with the investment property is to use the rental income to supplement her retirement income However Gina is uncomfortable with being a landlord and would rather not own real estate for investment purposes I do not recommend holding an investment you are uncomfortable with Instead I d recommend she look at alternatives that may provide similar returns with more peace of mind Thompson says There is no free lunch in the investment world and Gina needs to decide how much risk and what kind of risk she is comfortable with For Gina real estate as an investment should be reconsidered She could sell the property and redirect the proceeds to an investment she s more comfortable with Her remaining assets are in financial investments Sixteen per cent is held in cash per cent in fixed income and per cent in equities and mutual funds This asset mix is suitable for a balanced growth investor and is not suitable for Gina s risk tolerance It needs to be addressed Thompson says Thompson also found that Gina has per cent of her non registered assets invested in just one security the same major Canadian bank her advisor works for This is an over concentrated position and should be reviewed for suitability The balance is invested in different individual companies and four mutual funds far too many investments A well balanced portfolio of about stocks is enough to diversify away the maximum amount of market risk Thompson says More is not better in this case Gina says she requires after tax to meet her expenses in retirement To start Thompson recommends Gina consider using a portion of her registered assets to purchase a life annuity with a year guarantee An annuity is a contract made with a life insurance company to pay a guaranteed pre set series of payments monthly quarterly semi annually or annually for the term of the annuity In this case Gina would receive payments for her lifetime and if she dies before the year guarantee period her beneficiaries would continue to receive payments until the guarantee period ends Thompson says The payments from the life annuity are taxed as ordinary income and thus will be taxed in the same way as if she were to withdraw the funds directly from her current RRSP The annuity will provide guaranteed income for life of annually Reallocating investments is the next step for Gina Thompson recommends these portfolio switches allocate per cent in equity investments down from the current per cent per cent in fixed income up from the current per cent and per cent in cash down from the current per cent The equity portion is necessary to ensure her money keeps growing to keep pace with the rate of inflation Thompson suggests that Gina s fixed income investments be spread among corporate and government bonds guaranteed investment certificates GICs and income producing real estate investment trusts REITs Her per cent equity allocation could be spread out among blue chip dividend paying stocks preferred shares and broad based index tracking exchange traded funds ETFs Geographically Thompson recommends per cent exposure in Canada per cent in the U S and per cent in international equities Assuming a

456,Well I ve got good news for you You can become a millionaire and it has nothing to do with your family s money or your education It has everything to do with you If you follow these principles you ll be on your way to becoming a millionaire Are you ready Steer clear of debt From cars to clothes to houses to jewelry you can get a loan for pretty much anything nowadays There s this idea floating around our culture that you should get what you want the moment you want it Get it now pay for it later And pay more later But hear me say this Debt is quicksand to your financial dreams Every time you buy something on credit you re digging a deeper hole for yourself That money you re sending to lenders is money you could be putting toward your future Take the average car loan which has a monthly payment of and a term length of five years and nine months If you were to invest a month for five years instead you could have And look at this If you invested that for another years you could have almost Now where s that car in years Most likely it s in a junkyard Invest early In addition to steering clear of debt investing early can help you become a millionaire If you start putting away a month beginning at age you could reach millionaire status by age and be sitting pretty on a million nest egg come retirement at That s just a month If you waited until age to start investing you d have to put away a month to hit the million dollar mark by age Let s look at it a different way If you invested a month for years you could have million If you invested that a month for years instead you d only have You d have to work an extra years to age to hit million And you d have to work until age to hit million Get serious about your savings If you want to become a millionaire the percentage you invest is just as important as the actual act of investing The average personal savings rate in the U S including retirement savings and emergency funds is percent If we apply that percentage to the median household income of about it works out to a year or around a month Invested over years assuming a percent rate of return that money could turn into That number looks great right It might until you find out the average couple will need for medical expenses in retirement and that doesn t include long term care If you subtract that amount from your investment total you d only have about left Can you live off that for two decades It ends up being only a year Let me give you a much better scenario If you invested percent of that income you would be putting away a year or around a month In years that could grow to million assuming a percent return And if you waited just five more years you d be sitting on over million That beats a year don t you think Increase your income to reach your goal faster When I talk about how to become a millionaire people often say But Chris I don t make that much money I can t save enough Let s get something straight here You don t need a six figure salary to become a millionaire However if you re crunching the numbers and realize you still can t put away the recommended percent you do need to increase your income so you can How do you do that You can get a job that pays more You can take on a second job temporarily Or you can get training to increase your skills demand and earning potential For example let s look at the field of nursing You can become a nursing assistant licensed practical nurse registered nurse or an advanced practice registered nurse Each of those jobs requires a different level of training and testing and their salaries all vary An LPN makes around a year while an RN makes around When you increase your skills and expertise you can increase your salary Cut unnecessary expenses As you work toward becoming a millionaire you also want to make sure your money is being spent with intention So sit down and evaluate your expenses regularly Look at your budgets from previous months to see where money may be leaking or where you could cut expenses That s money you could be investing and putting toward your percent Remember you control your expenses You may not dictate how much you re charged per watt of electricity but you do control the thermostat Keep your millionaire goal front and center The steps to becoming a millionaire run counter to most people s behavior which means you ll see friends and family going places doing things and buying stuff And if you focus on what they re doing you could be in trouble financially Just this year a study showed that percent of Millennials said they spent money they hadn t planned to because of what they saw on social media And percent of them along with percent of Gen Xers and percent of Baby Boomers believe social media creates a comparison problem We live in a comparison culture We buy stuff we don t need to impress people we don t even know Who are you trying to impress Seriously It s a good question to ask yourself when you re tempted to buy something you don t need The people I know who have become millionaires didn t get there by playing the comparison game They stayed focused on their own goals and didn t worry about what other people were thinking or doing Here s my challenge to you Instead of obsessing over what you don t have focus on the valuable but intangible gifts in your life family and friends your church work that matters the legacy you ll leave your children Those will bring you much greater and longer lasting joy than a new car or a destination vacation And know that it s OK to still enjoy stuff Just make sure it doesn t derail your larger plan to become a millionaire Chris Hogan is a No national bestselling author dynamic speaker and host of the Chris Hogan Show For more

459,Given the dire predictions that we re not saving enough for retirement a recent HSBC report says per cent of working age Canadians haven t even started one wonders how parents can begin to save and invest for their own future while buying the bigger house second car and all the other stuff that goes with children When you re cradling your newborn saving for retirement is likely the last thing on your mind but that s precisely when you need to start says Brian Himmelman president of Himmelman Associates Financial Advisors Inc in Halifax While some people have private sector or government jobs where retirement savings are organized for them Mr Himmelman is seeing more self employed people or those whose work plan doesn t provide enough It becomes essential for them to build a retirement plan on their own The biggest problem parents face is that they don t know the number how much they need to save Mr Himmelman says Often they don t have a structured or written financial plan Parents have a lot of balls in the air such as a mortgage credit cards childcare and then their retirement There s social pressure on parents to put kids in so many activities spending as much as a year per child but your retirement plan has to come first You need to set up a discipline and a specific amount of money that goes into it regularly Mr Himmelman observes that while there are a lot of digital banking products available there s very little planning to go with them He warns that without a plan the to years it takes to build a retirement can disappear through procrastination or because people are dealing with one crisis after another so they re always playing catch up There s a behavioural psychology to money to investing to discipline Mr Himmelman says Not everyone needs coaching but the majority do need that check in with a professional to affirm that what they re doing is correct Your retirement plan shouldn t just be on a new app that took five seconds to download As much as you can go to Google it can just create more confusion and complications for people It doesn t take long going down the wrong road to set you back years A retirement plan will show what percentage of income must be saved and what duration of time is needed to hit a specific goal explains Mr Himmelman Once a plan is in place parents shouldn t feel guilty about saving for their own future first Everybody always wants to say Oh my kids come first says Mr Himmelman But if you were on a plane they d say be sure you put your oxygen mask on first You re no good to your kids if you re up to your ears in debt by the time they reach university age You ve got to look after yourself first so you can help them later Cherise Berman principal at Bespoke Financial Consulting Inc a fee only planning firm in Toronto points out that it can be cheaper per child once you have more than one Parents will also find their spending shifts with new responsibilities Once you start a family you re going to have competing goals for your money so it really becomes a balancing act Ms Berman says Keep an eye on retirement and start planning even if you re young and can t allocate much at that stage Keep contributing to it Her advice is to take stock of all the resources you have available your income plus the Canada Child Benefit then decide how much to allocate to each goal It s important to focus on all goals and not just the immediate ones Don t leave retirement goals for later She suggests using pre authorized contributions to put the act of saving on autopilot Then you can set it and forget it We see a lot of parents who are providing everything for their children through the various stages and potentially jeopardizing their own retirement says Ms Berman It really is about finding that right balance Saving opportunities along the way include using RESPs to save for your child s postsecondary education Not only are contributions tax deferred explains Ms Berman but you also receive government grants for up to per cent of your contributions up to Always take the free money Ms Berman advises That goes for your retirement savings too Plus if your employer offers a retirement or savings plan where they contribute or will match your contributions take advantage of it Don t leave those dollars on the table Another key is to adjust your own discretionary spending limit vacations and dining out during crunch times when there are extra expenses for children And set limits for the children too Parents need to have a conversation with children about their expectations so they understand how and to what extent you can support them says Ms Berman Don t necessarily provide everything I see a lot of parents covering all the costs for their children education cellphones car insurance Because of that they may not be saving enough for retirement Kids need to know there are limits to what parents can provide and that parents have their own savings goals Older kids should have some skin in the game too whether it s contributing to their education or household expenses She suggests that teens can start earning through summer employment or part time work if they can as well as applying to the hundreds of scholarships available starting with ScholarshipsCanada com Parents can set goals with the children help them to find ways to contribute and to develop a plan to get there Teach the kids to budget too says Ms Berman Sometimes we encourage parents to include their children in reviewing the parents target plan so they see what the

461,The power of that coalition is now fractured over whether to support key recommendations of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission Some of these groups are turning thumbs up others thumbs down and most still want to see more analysis on proposals to replace triple option TRICARE and to phase in a new retirement system As the House armed services subcommittee on personnel discovered Wednesday at a stakeholders hearing where a group stands will depend on whom it serves Associations largely representing career retirees want to preserve the value and not risk force retention effectiveness of traditional year retirement for future generations of service members Groups with larger veteran populations most of whom left service after a tour or two and with no retirement benefits favor the commission s call to blend a smaller immediate annuity at or more years service with a new k like savings plan that has government matching of member contributions and full vesting in the balance after only two years of service Reserve and Guard associations also tend to favor the more modern retirement features found in the private sector And though a majority of groups are wary of replacing TRICARE even with a new health care allowance for in service families to buy coverage off a menu of commercial health insurance plans the National Military Family Association sees potential here for families to gain more choice and faster easier access to care Rep Joe Heck R Nev chairman of the personnel subcommittee said the heavy lift for Congress from among commission recommendations is retirement health care and on base stores and lawmakers need to hear the views of stakeholder groups This day they heard a cacophony not a choir Scott Bousum legislative director of the Enlisted Association of the National Guard praised the commission for designing flexible mechanisms that current and future service members can use to choose health care and retirement packages that fit their individual needs The retirement system today said Brendon Gehrke senior legislative associate for Veterans of Foreign Wars leaves roughly percent of all veterans behind their civilian counterparts in saving for retirement While nearly percent of fulltime civilian workers have access to employer sponsored retirement plans and percent of employers with k plans match contributions by employees Gehrke said the government contributes nothing to the retirement of those who often are the most deserving those who bore the burden of battle Though not rejecting the commission s plan outright retired Air Force Col Michael Hayden director of government relations for Military Officers Association of America said MOAA is concerned the plan lacks the drawing power to keep enough members in service out to years and beyond Also Hayden testified the combined effect of higher insurance premiums for working age retirees and lower retirement value if these were in place today would pare compensation for a retired E with years by over a year for a loss of percent until they can start to draw from their government matching thrift savings plan at age and a half The commission s push for flexibility and choice in health insurance and retirement options though lauded by some was challenged by Hayden as creating uncertainty both for careerists in understanding the value of their compensation and for force managers in retaining personnel Service members stationed around the world should not have to worry if they have selected the appropriate retirement fund or appropriate health care coverage for their families Hayden said Making radical changes to the core retention programs risks unintended negative effects Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America surveyed its members all combat veterans and found percent favor retirement reform said IAVA s Chris Neiweem They see it as fundamentally unfair that one could serve or years with three four five or more deployments and leave the military with absolutely no retirement benefit Neiweem said Yet a careerist who possibly never even deployed could be entitled to full benefit package Rep Tim Walz D Minn a retired Army National Guard command sergeant major asked if the witnesses accepted the notion that to gain portable retirement benefits for percent of the force the value of traditional year retirement would have to be cut for future members MOAA doesn t believe that Hayden said But VFW s Gehrke said theoretically it doesn t have to be but without a tradeoff costs are going to skyrocket He said the commission plan is the next best alternative Heck asked if witnesses if they agreed with one commissioner who said TRICARE is broken and can t be fixed Bousum Hayden Neiweem and John Stovall national security director for the American Legion disagreed Gehrke however described TRICARE as in a death spiral And Karen Ruedisueli deputy director of government relations for National Military Family Association agreed with that commissioner that TRICARE is broken The commission s TRICARE Choice proposal Ruedisueli said merits serious consideration given its potential to provide families a more robust and valuable health care benefit one that would address many beneficiary complaints about the current system But NMFA needs more proof she said that subsidizing access to commercial health insurance won t jeopardize overall medical readiness to support the troops or trigger higher out of pocket costs for families,"The Military Coalition can make Congress tremble from

464,The loans also can work for well heeled retirees looking for a buffer to keep them from selling investments at the wrong time according to academic researchers And Congress last month gave a boost to the type of reverse mortgage that works best for that purpose Reverse mortgages let homeowners who are at least years old borrow against their home equity The loans don t have to be used for a specific purpose but typically are used for home modifications repairs medical expenses or home care that elderly people might not otherwise be able to afford The loan is due with interest when homeowners move out sell the home die or fail to pay property taxes or homeowner s insurance premiums The homeowner s heirs typically sell the house pay the balance and keep what is left At least households have an outstanding reverse mortgage loan according to the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association a Washington industry group In the past many financial planners recommended reverse mortgages for their clients only as a last resort because fees were relatively high as much as of the loan amount That changed a few years ago when a new product was developed by the industry and insured by the Federal Housing Administration called the HECM Saver which typically has lower upfront borrowing costs than earlier types of reverse mortgages HECM stands for home equity conversion mortgage With lower borrowing costs some planners are finding new ways to use reverse mortgages to avoid selling depressed investments or to lower tax bills Retirement is really about cash flow says Martin James a certified public accountant in Mooresville Ind Even for a person who s got their mortgage paid off it s nice to have a line of credit sitting there Earlier this year the HECM program was eyed by federal lawmakers as a financial risk to the FHA and lawmakers considered curtailing the program The bill passed by Congress is intended to give the Department of Housing and Urban Development the leeway to make changes to keep the program going probably after Oct says Peter Bell chief executive of the lenders group Interested in tapping your home as a security blanket A few things to consider Your house could be a reliable credit line If your home equity line of credit gets canceled a reverse mortgage might be a good substitute Three certified financial planners at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania published a paper last year in the Journal of Financial Planning that recommends using a reverse mortgage line of credit to meet retirement income needs during a big market drop rather than selling investments A few years ago we were starting to get calls from clients saying Hey my line of credit s been canceled They have plenty of resources but that was an emergency pot of money says John Salter the paper s lead author The researchers used what they called a standby reverse mortgage strategy meaning the reverse mortgage line of credit served as a source of readily available cash when retirees portfolio values dropped below the level where they could meet their goals Using a portfolio worth and a home value of among other assumptions the researchers found that using a reverse mortgage s line of credit significantly improved the chances the portfolio would last through the retiree s lifetime because it reduced the risk of having to sell investments when they had fallen in value Tapping home equity could lower tax bills Some retirees pay off their mortgages with taxable withdrawals from their k or other accounts Yet they might be able to lower their income taxes by using reverse mortgages to pay off their traditional mortgages Mr James says if they have substantial equity That means they wouldn t need to withdraw as much tax deferred retirement savings which are subject to income tax and can bump retirees into higher tax brackets Plus without investment distributions needed to make mortgage payments they might be able to keep their overall incomes under the income threshold at which Social Security retirement benefits are taxed Mr James says Consult an expert Before you start talking to lenders consider getting advice from a reverse mortgage counselor certified by HUD to learn more about the options and mechanics The National Council on Aging and other nonprofit groups sometimes offer such counseling Keep the kids in the loop When Mr James broaches the idea of a reverse mortgage with clients the first thing they do is wrinkle their nose he says One big reason Many parents want to leave their home often their biggest asset to their children as their inheritance Still he contends that many adult children don t really want the house and that they are eager for their parents to use their assets to have a better rest of their life Using a reverse mortgage allows for a little more diversification meaning retirees could leave other investments with potential for better returns to their families Mr James says Email familyvalue wsj com END Dow Jones Newswires August ET GMT,"

465,The effects have been profound and are ushering in what Bogle called a coming train wreck for American retirees As recently as a few decades ago the retirement income foundation for most people consisted of a pension Social Security and personal savings in that order However that model has effectively been reversed Most companies have switched from defined benefit plans like pensions to defined contribution plans like k s With a pension the company is responsible for a defined benefit like paying a certain percentage of an employee s final salary throughout retirement Under a k plan the company is responsible for a defined contribution which is usually a match on employee contributions Without pensions workers are on their own for retirement income The retirement income foundation for people without pensions is personal savings and Social Security For the pension less retirement income is largely a personal responsibility as opposed to an obligation of a company or government entity But even those with pensions could be in for rocky futures according to Bogle That s because many corporations along with state and local governments assume returns of percent on the investments that fund their pension obligations Bogle said those returns are simply not going to materialize over the next decade or so he said to percent was more realistic If the investments don t perform that means corporations and governments need to pump more money into the plans or provide fewer benefits for pensioners The second piece of the foundation Social Security is on shaky financial ground Bogle said it s underfunded and in need of reform If not retirees may have to accept fewer benefits And if we go too long without fixing the system it may dissolve altogether Given the iffy health of Social Security it s scary so many will rely on it almost exclusively for retirement income This is where personal savings should fill the gap But many Americans simply don t have enough saved Take a look at the findings from the Northwestern Mutual Planning Progress Study n One third have less than in retirement savings n percent have nothing saved n One third of Baby Boomers have or less saved n percent of those surveyed have not planned for outliving their money On top of that Bogle pointed to another problem A primary retirement savings vehicle the k is ill suited for retirement savings for a few key reasons First you can take your money out Second you can borrow from the account And third there is too much investment choice People derail their retirements by withdrawing money early from retirement accounts or taking loans from them And most people aren t suited to picking investments It can be overwhelming and complex All of these forces combined are why Bogle said we re on course for a train wreck But it s not all doom and gloom While k and similar plans aren t perfect they re good options for most people As the Northwestern Mutual study shows the problem isn t people saving in the wrong places it s that they re not saving enough period Saving more will obviously help Beyond that there are tools and strategies available to help you live the retirement you want even if the market doesn t perform For instance annuities and cash value insurance like an indexed universal life policy can provide income in retirement and they often have protections from market fluctuations When you think about it a lot of this stuff is out of our control It s not like you or I can singlehandedly fix the Social Security system or any one pension fund So control what you can control Two great places to start are with personal savings and getting financial help from a trusted professional Increasing your savings basically gives future you a raise Who doesn t like a raise Don t forget the retirement income responsibility falls primarily on your shoulders It s complex Getting help could mean avoiding the train wreck and ultimately be one of the best decisions you ever made Holly Peterson is the owner of Elite Retirement Strategies and a former radio show host You can find her online at eliteretirementstrategies com or by calling,"Last week I wrote about an interview featuring John Bogle, who founded The Vanguard Group and created the first index mutual fund.

471,According to numbers provided by the Canada Revenue Agency there are a lot of procrastinators out there As of mid week million personal income tax returns had been received by the Surrey Tax Centre which covers B C Yukon and southern Saskatchewan out of an expected million Nationally million returns out of an expected million had been filed So for you procrastinators and even for those who have already filed here s something to keep in mind In B C the CRA has more than employees working full time on education administration and auditing and enforcing tax payments More than across the country look just at the underground economy where undeclared income is earned So you may want to think twice before fudging your numbers Canadian residents are required to report all their worldwide income on their tax return said Irene Jacob executive director tax services at Ernst Young in Vancouver That includes income earned offshore tips even the value of services received in return for work performed And it s per cent of that income So all tips should be declared So too should all money received for providing services that are part of your business like building a deck for a neighbour or helping someone with their books That s true even if the payment is not in cash but rather in goods or services you receive in return Jacob said Then the amount you would have normally charged for those services has to be included in your income If you are a resident in Canada and there are rules on who is a resident all money earned outside Canada has to be reported too Jacob said So it s not just limited to what s on a T slip she said Some exceptions windfalls like lottery winnings and gifts provided they are unrelated to employment So giving a friend a pair of Canucks playoff tickets out of the goodness of your heart as if does not need to be included in your friend s income tax But if your employer gives you the tickets just for fun the value priceless may be taxable But who s going to know right Well the CRA has ways of finding out One way is through snitches Last year the CRA received more than calls of suspected tax evasion through its tip line said Bradley Alvarez communications manager with the CRA in Vancouver There are other ways too like cross referencing information with WorkSafeBC or other organizations and comparing returns with those of employers or co workers So there are a lot of systems in place to try to catch things Alvarez said And the closer to cash the industry is the more scrutiny there is on the industry The CRA s best ammunition If the taxpayer has not filed or has declared less income than the CRA thinks he earned the CRA can impose an arbitrary assessment setting the amount of income that has to be declared Alvarez said Taxes will be owing on that amount with interest from the date the tax should have been paid Alvarez said Then it s up to the taxpayer to to prove the amount he declared is right And that can be tough Jacob said That s why it s important that people try to keep their own documents and a log or list of what they ve received so they can support it Jacob said Having no documents is no excuse as taxpayers are required to keep records she added On top of arbitrary assessments and interest charges penalties can also be levied for trying to hide income up to per cent of the tax owing and five years in jail Alvarez said Before that happens taxpayers can use the CRA s voluntary disclosure program to come clean But if the taxpayer is already in the CRA s sights it s too late Alvarez said Jacob believes the CRA may be even more diligent this year going after people who owe tax If the economy goes down tax revenues go down so they ll use their resources because it s important for them to collect the tax revenues Jacob said fionaanderson vancouversun com SOME TAX TIPS FROM ERNST YOUNG Share the love and your income If you received eligible pension income in up to per cent can

472,That lost us quite a bit of money she says To make matters worse Bogaczyk s husband Thomas had to stop working a year ago because of degenerative arthritis forcing the family to deplete his k to cover living expenses And while Medicare pays the daily fee at Gene s day care center and the couple s adult son and daughter help out with rent money is tight and retirement is an afterthought It s frightening says Bogaczyk who frets about the day that she herself could fall ill We don t have that problem yet but that s not to say we won t have it As the baby boom generation born after World War II ages and their parents live longer Bogaczyk s dilemma is echoed in some form in nearly every family faced with securing long term care for an aging relative without sidelining its own retirement plans Rhonda Papell a homemaker in Brentwood found herself thrown a year ago into the role of caregiver for an estranged mother in law with extreme dementia This is someone we didn t have a relationship with Now she is basically my job Papell spends much of her time managing a stream of complicated medical billing for her mother in law and wondering how she and her husband will continue paying the a month board and care bill after the mother in law s money runs out Rochelle Mallen a homemaker in Encino felt it necessary to hire a full time live in caregiver for her year old father David even though he is mobile and sharp as a tack Before the bear market set in pressure was substantial on working people of the sandwich generation those caught between caring for aging parents and saving for their kids college funds Now in addition to all that these sandwichers are having to factor severely contracted retirement portfolios into the equation And that is proving a bitter pill to swallow Retirement plus It s like retirement plus says Jason Karpf a marketing manager in Chatsworth who is juggling retirement planning for his mother saving for college for his own two grade school children plus planning his own retirement You have to put yourself on a financial discipline says Karpf It s like a diet Karpf was very involved in helping to manage his grandfather s entrance into a rest home for Alzheimer s patients and he learned from that experience how difficult financing such care can be even when the patient has planned well He had a healthy fixed income but all of it was quickly consumed It was quite a financial balancing act to make sure all the right choices were made says Karpf And while his own mother is in decent shape with a pension from the Writers Guild and access to the Motion Picture Television Fund s retirement home in Woodland Hills Karpf worries about financing the unexpected You can only plan so much he says Even in situations where the elderly themselves are paying for their own long term care the management of that care can become a full time job with serious financial ramifications for the relative who takes it on People are quitting their jobs to give the care then they lose their own health benefits says Bonnie Lawrence communications manager at Family Caregiver Alliance a state nonprofit that helps overwhelmed caregivers manage the dizzying elder care system A survey by the FCA found that percent of people helping to care for an elderly relative had quit their job to provide care and percent had reduced their work hours It causes an economic ripple through the system says state Sen Sheila Kuehl D Los Angeles who introduced a bill signed into law last month that would allow employees in California up to six weeks paid leave to attend to the needs of children spouses or elderly relatives facing debilitating conditions or requiring other care In addition the California Legislature pushed through a tax credit in to help cover the cost of such long term care But that s cold comfort when long term care insurance premiums can approach that amount for a couple in one month The basic categories of long term elder care include in home care by a registered nurse which can cost more than a month depending on how it is billed nursing homes which fall in terms of level of care somewhere between assisted living and a hospital a month and assisted living and retirement homes plus monthly In addition to these full time options there are various forms of part time care such as adult day care centers a day popular with elderly people cohabitating with a family caregiver There is also a growing trend with California at the forefront of keeping the elderly in their own homes and delivering services like cleaning or grocery shopping on an ad hoc basis Some of these services are covered by government programs for seniors with few or no private assets But a lot of it comes out of the pockets of the elderly themselves and their children Of billion spent on elder care in the latest figures available billion came from private pockets versus billion from federal and state coffers according to a Family Caregiver Alliance survey of resource centers including two in Colton and Los Angeles tag f Helvetica f b f i s w l tag Pinched and sandwiched off tag l tag off The owners of those pockets are fully aware of their unenviable situation They are pinched and they are sandwiched says Nancy Wexler a geriatric care manager in Tarzana who helps place and monitor seniors who need elder care services They are also usually surprised at the high cost of services and how few assets a senior must have to qualify for government coverage I once asked a social worker about families and sticker shock says Anne Burns Johnson president of the California Association of Homes and Services for the Aging She said that the first time they begin to explore elder care services they are horrified by the cost Then they get called to the emergency room five times in a month and that s Making decisions about elder care is hardest for caregivers helping middle income elderly people those who make too much to qualify for state or federal programs but not enough to pay out of pocket for top quality assisted living centers or professional home care for extended periods of time Medicare does fine with people in hospitals but it doesn t do anything for long term care unless people are penniless says Frank Weber an estate planner in West Covina So where does that leave adult children of elderly people with expensive long term needs Elder care consultants urge planning as the only way to avoid financial havoc brought on by an aging parent with expensive needs and no assets But they also say most clients they see are not well prepared and don t realize they cannot count on government programs to provide long term health care Our society is not prepared for the impact of having an elder who needs care says Carol Goldman a geriatric care manager at Caremanagement Services in Long Beach They don t have nearly the information or education they need They re like Oh my God this is happening can you help First folks over with or more in assets should look into long term health care insurance which has only been around for about a decade says Joseph Solomon an elder care planner in Los Angeles Premiums aren t cheap around a year for a year old but the benefits aren t usually limited to specific services and the cost of the premiums is tax deductible But as with any kind of insurance reading between the lines is crucial Goldman an expert in the field says she was surprised to discover that a long term care policy her father in law had only covered him for two years An alternative or supplement to long term care insurance is to put assets into a fixed income annuity that is Medi Cal friendly meaning a monthly annuity payment that doesn t affect Medi Cal coverage for a nursing home says Solomon For folks who are house rich and cash poor the best bet is taking a reverse mortgage on the house then putting that into a fixed income annuity creating a guaranteed long term payout Whatever option people do choose to care for their elders they must choose something and plan ahead for it You have to do it for your children and your grandchildren says Karpf the marketing manager in Chatsworth It s your final act of love toward them dlim end,"Barbara Correa Staff Writer When Betty Bogaczyk's parents died, she made a commitment to look after her older brother Gene, severely disabled by cerebral

chair of EDS s board of trustees The church is shrinking The need for clergy is shrinking And the institutional support is shrinking Mainline Protestant seminaries are facing an existential crisis after a decade of mounting red ink Enrollment has fallen by nearly over the past decade according to the Association of Theological Schools an accrediting agency Mainline churches where membership has been falling for decades can support fewer full time pastors than in the past Denominations are pulling back their financial support for seminaries while the cost of educating students is still going up As a result some of the oldest and most celebrated seminaries in the country institutions that helped shape both Christianity and higher education in the U S are on the brink of financial collapse Andover Newton Theological School the nation s first graduate school of any kind founded in outside of Boston sold its campus in July and is moving to the Yale Divinity School campus in Connecticut Claremont School of Theology recently said it is hoping to sell its campus and relocate from Southern California to a less expensive area Episcopal Divinity School which pushed the Episcopal church to ordain women and accept gay and lesbian members will affiliate with Union Theological Seminary in New York But the school s faculty and students aren t invited to join Daniel O Aleshire the former executive director of the Association of Theological Schools said seminaries were facing a mergers and acquisitions environment Many smaller schools are joining with larger ones on university campuses which have remained more financially stable Still Mr Aleshire didn t see this as the end times for theological higher education but as an evolution of its mission Theological education is starting to look more like an executive M B A not a degree required for initial practice in ministry he said Until recent years seminaries largely focused on training young college graduates to become full time church pastors Schools like EDS and Andover Newton helped establish a template for what being a church pastor in the U S meant Students spent three years on a seminary campus studying for a master s of divinity the degree many denominations have long required for pastors They studied Greek and Hebrew so they could read some of the earliest Bible texts Such academic rigor gave rise to a class of clergy who were often among the most educated and respected people in their communities But as the nation has grown more secular the role of clergy and seminaries has shifted With dropping church attendance there are fewer full time pastor jobs available In the past years the average age of all pastors in the U S has risen to from according to a study by the Barna Group a research firm specializing in the study of religious beliefs Seminaries have taken steps to attract more students effectively redefining theological graduate education in the process A shrinking portion of students are pursuing the traditional three year master s of divinity Schools are attracting older students who may not plan on a career in church ministry A growing portion of seminary students are taking most classes online Claremont School of Theology which traces its roots to has more than doubled its enrollment since to more than students in large part because most of the school s students now take most of their classes online The school has also embraced an interreligious curriculum and only a quarter of the students are members of the United Methodist Church with which the school is affiliated

rebounded over the past two years Many of the churches that are growing fastest like nondenominational Pentecostal churches don t require a seminary degree for pastors Skye Jethani an evangelical Christian pastor and author said falling seminary attendance is a symptom of a growing consumerism in American Christianity Fewer churches have the expectation that pastors have gone to seminary Mr Jethani said In popular evangelicalism they don t really care about your theology What they care about is are you an entertaining speaker or can you run a complicated business like a megachurch Still some seminaries are growing Albert Mohler president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary a theologically conservative school in Louisville Ky said the school s enrollment had hit record highs in recent years A growing number are taking classes online and a record number are studying to be church pastors In an era when Christianity is becoming less dominant Mr Mohler said young people heading to seminary wanted an unquestionably orthodox theological education A theological seminary that isn t training pastors is just negotiating its way out of business Mr Mohler said There s nothing other

487,Ezra Klein Let s start with the macroeconomics What does war do to the broader economy Joe Stiglitz The macroeconomic effects were huge in the Iraq war Libya is more complicated because one way or another there was going to be an eruption For Iraq our book assumed the war added to to the price of oil The reason we did that was we thought no one would object to numbers that were so conservative The price had gone from per gallon to Lots of things are always going on but it was not coincidental that the price started going up very strongly after the war And corroborating our view was that prior to the war the futures markets had expected the price to remain around a gallon One of the other things we argued in the book remember this was before the financial crisis was that one of the reasons for our lax monetary policy which we thought was distorting the economy and contributing to a bubble was that purchasing power was being taken out of the economy to buy oil and the Federal Reserve had to compensate for that and it did it through looser monetary policy And the other major costs that aren t included in our initial accounting The big points we raised in Iraq and Afghanistan and have updated in congressional testimony pdf are the disabilities the health care costs that follow the war and the equipment you have to replace after the war I ve seen you make the point that as an economist who won a Nobel prize for studying the the role of information in decision making skipping this honest accounting process deprives us of crucial information we need to make good decisions about matters of war Could you expand on that a bit This is particularly the case for wars of choice which most recent wars have been When we were attacked in Pearl Harbor we weren t going to go through a cost benefit analysis of responding The Iraq War however was a war of choice And if you re going to approach that with any degree of rationality you have to think about what it s going to cost you To do that you want an inclusive cost estimate particularly because you know the government is going to try and narrow the cost down They re going to talk about only the cost of the bombs whereas we emphasized that there are a whole other set of costs taking care of the disabled replacing equipment etc that any good accounting system would take into account One objection people often raise to this line of thinking is that the president needs to move fast when making decisions about whether to go to war and if we normalized a budgeting process he d lose that crucial flexibility Two points One the Iraq War was a war of choice and so we didn t have to rush in We weren t being bombed But the second point is that even if you don t go through this analysis before you embark as you re fighting the war these issues arise over and over again During the war we made a lot of penny wise and pound foolish decisions To not spend on body armor at the beginning clearly increased our spending in the long run Same for mine resistant vehicles which are as much as a million dollars apiece They re expensive but compared to not buying them they re cheap A large fraction of the disabilities would ve been avoided if they d had those rather than Humvees If you d had the accounting based on the full cost of health care you would ve known they were a bargain The other objection is that you can t put a price on a human life Iraq was advocated on at least partially humanitarian grounds and the intervention in Libya came in the context of a more acute humanitarian crisis So can you really try to make these projections when so many lives hang in the balance I m sympathetic to the view that the economics are not everything We didn t try to value the benefit of winning the war for instance But whatever our judgments about the benefits we have to be realistic about the costs I don t think any of us thought tallying the costs would provide the answer to whether we should do it But not to have those costs is a vital mistake In the case of valuing lives that was one of the things we really sought to emphasize If you started valuing lives of just our troops you would realize the cost of the Iraq war was enormous We don t value the lives of our troops in the way we value lives in the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Transportation If we started using those numbers we d get a very different total cost and even more so if we began valuing Iraqi lives You ve written that some of the rules you came across while researching your book shocked you In particular you brought up the odd way we pay for contractor insurance Can you go into a bit more detail on that We require contractors to have insurance But no private guy will pay for the insurance so we pay for the insurance ourselves Interestingly the bad actor in all this was AIG The government went and contracted with AIG paying them the premiums and then after the contractors got injured AIG claimed that the injuries were excluded under their policy So they d exclude for instance death from combat but take a very broad definition of combat where everyone in the combat zone was in combat So they d be getting these premiums and there d be almost no one who they d admit qualified for the benefit So we were paying the premiums to AIG and in most cases they were denying the claims,"In 2008, Nobel prize-winning economist Joe Stiglitz, alongside economist Linda Bilmes, published the 'The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict.' The book â€” which Stiglitz summarized in a 2008 speech(pdf) â€” argued that the way we account for war tends to vastly underestimate the actual cost of conflict because it misses everything but the direct, short-term expenditures made on troops and munitions. As we begin our intervention in Libya â€” an intervention for which we've seen little-to-nothing in the way of cost estimates â€” it seemed a good time to return to Stiglitz's original arguments about how to budget for war, and why it's important to do so.

495,There are many different ways of measuring the strength of fund managers returns assets and risk to name but a few One theme that often comes up is the question of style and what that comes down to is the matter of value versus growth Value managers are those who buy stocks that appear to be undervalued in the belief that they will turn around and reflect their true value Growth involves buying stocks that you think will go up even if they re fairly or overvalued now There are various in between styles growth at a reasonable price neutral core but most mainstream styles fall somewhere on a spectrum between these two poles The two years of soaring markets from March to March were ideal for a growth manager in that most things went up and continued to do so long after value managers could no longer see anything that warranted buying So it s interesting to note that when prominent research group Morningstar last week printed a study of Australian large cap share fund managers most of the top ranked ones were value managers and the bottom ranked ones were growth Specifically five of the managers deserved the highly recommended ranking They are BGI GMO Investors Mutual Perennial Value and Perpetual Investments All of them bar BGI which Morningstar calls a blend style are value investors The lowest grade Morningstar gave to any manager was hold which it conferred on Axa HSBC Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch All but HSBC are growth styled managers Why does value win Well partly because Morningstar isn t just evaluating the past two years it s looking back over the past five and that includes a bear market In terms of capital preservation value managers fared much better at protecting investors capital in falling markets says Morningstar On average this group produced a per cent return in compared with a minus per cent average return from growth managers Morningstar sees two other reasons First value stocks outperformed growth stocks Specifically after the tech stock bubble burst in March investors shifted to defensive stocks which had been left undervalued as the herd piled into technology stocks As a result prices of defensive stocks rose and defensive stocks were where value styled investors had put their money Secondly smaller cap stocks have done better than large cap stocks in four of the past five years and value managers tend to have a higher exposure to mid caps Nevertheless Morningstar adds a caution While style and size factors have helped value style managers deliver competitive returns the free ride that value has enjoyed appears to be over Morningstar thinks that in a future choppy market returns are going to come down to good stock selection no matter what the style of the manager,"SMART FUNDS

499,Americans believe that the tax code is rigged against them and when companies can use complicated loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes they re not wrong Levin said in a statement One of the tax strategies targeted by the legislation hopscotching allows a foreign parent company or foreign affiliate to lend the tax deferred overseas earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U S companies known as controlled foreign corporations or CFCs to non CFC foreign affiliates The borrowed funds can then be used to repay debt make capital investments in the U S and elsewhere purchase the stock of a related domestic or foreign corporation or make dividend payments to shareholders CFCs can thus circumvent a rule in Section of the Tax Code that was intended to prevent the use of a CFC s untaxed earnings for direct investments in the U S without incurring U S tax The legislation would end this tax strategy by providing that a U S shareholder s gross income includes not only a pro rata share of any increase in the CFC s investment of earnings in United States property but also a pro rata share of any increase in the CFC s investment of earnings in foreign group property The second tax strategy de controlling enables foreign controlled U S multinational groups to avoid U S taxes on the deferred earnings of CFCs by reducing the U S ownership of CFCs just below the level that subjects the foreign subsidiaries to U S taxation The term controlled foreign corporation is defined as any foreign corporation if more than percent of its stock is owned by U S shareholders To de control a controlled foreign corporation a non CFC foreign affiliate can transfer sufficient amount of property to the CFC in exchange for percent or more of the CFC stock The result is that the foreign corporation is no longer a controlled foreign corporation Once a CFC is de controlled it is free to make direct investments in United States property without triggering U S taxes The bill would close this loophole by providing that the stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person is attributed to a related United States person for purposes of determining whether the related U S person is a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation and therefore whether the foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation The Treasury Department issued temporary regulations in April to prevent hopscotching by inverted companies The hopscotching provision in the Protecting the U S Corporate Tax Base Act of is broader and would apply to U S companies that have inverted along with U S multinational companies that have been acquired by foreign companies The de controlling provision was included in President Obama s fiscal year and budget proposals,"Rep.

day in a row against USD government is implementing IMF requirements by increasing utility prices and military conflict in the East remains in its complicated state At the same time just a week ago it seemed that conflict in the East of the county was solved agreements signed in Minsk led to significant growth of share prices of Ukrainian public companies Share price fluctuations best reflect investor mood towards Ukraine these days Over the past week market capitalization of Ukrainian agrarian holdings grew on the average by Core of the growth is attributed to the period of February when it reached after signing of Minsk agreements When it became apparent that these agreements are not upheld either total capitalization started decline which reached Therefore macroeconomic and regional risks at the moment are still determining investment climate for Ukrainian companies to larger extent than their operational and financial results On one hand share price volatility alienates

rye rice barley etc which are moved over Ukraine and abolishes excessive administration of the turnover of pesticides and farming chemicals simplification of the procedures for state trials registration and re registration of pesticides and farming chemicals In addition the resolution simplifies regulatory approval procedures in the subsurface use sector and cancels the state registration procedure for dietary foods Economic Development Ministry raised its forecast for Ukrainian grain exports In February the inter agency working group under the Economic Development and Trade Ministry raised its forecast for Ukrainian grain exports in MY marketing year July June to MMT from its January forecast of MMT According to a balance prepared by the group Ukraine may export MMT of wheat MMT of barley and MMT of corn this marketing year The ministry calculated the above mentioned export volumes based on a grain crop estimate of MMT As reported before Ukraine s grain exports totaled MMT by February Under a memorandum signed between the Ag Ministry and grain traders in late January the maximum admitted volume of milling wheat exports from Ukraine in January June was agreed at MMT Feed wheat exports may total MMT by the end of the marketing year according to the memorandum The upper limit for Ukrainian rye exports in H was agreed at KMT exports for the marketing year totaled KMT The upper export limits for barley and corn equal MMT MMT and MMT MMT respective CROP CONDITIONS FEBRUARY Unstable weather with little precipitation prevailed all over Ukraine from February It became slightly colder after February Air temperature fell on average to C at night even C in the north and to C in the daytime Abnormally warm weather was seen earlier this month when average temperature for the ten days was C above normal This caused active snow melting and thawing of the topsoil However according to agricultural meteorologists average daily air temperatures were below the biological limit for plant growth almost all across Ukraine from February therefore winter crops were dormant Apart from the temperature drop the snow cover restored on vast expanses in the same period This substantially protected crops against the negative impact of frost AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult According to observers cm of snow covered the ground in Kharkiv region As a result during frost occurrences of C soil temperature at the tillering node depth of winter crops did not drop lower than while the killing temperature equaled C A thin snow cover of just cm developed in the Steppe zone The topsoil froze to a depth of at most cm Minimum soil temperature at the tillering node depth of winter wheat reached At the same time the killing temperature for mid hardy cultivars of winter wheat was estimated at C as of February In the north of Ukraine the soil was frozen to a depth of cm on February The snow cover was cm high and rather compact ice crust developed in relief depressions under it The period of February saw the most favorable weather for winter crop plants because low air and soil temperatures with almost no snow in the fields could negatively impact viability of late sown winter wheat and barley which had one to three leaves per plant prior to overwintering However a crop survey showed that just single cultivars lost to of leaves with an intact tillering node Once plant growth resumes in spring such damages will be rapidly offset with an intense build up in the assimilation apparatus and will almost not affect the yield formation in winter crops Crop condition is generally satisfactory However in view of a significant portion of late sown winter crops and consequently their comparatively weak plant development before the winter the most favorable for them may be an early spring renewal of growth moderate temperatures and good soil moisture supply According to specialists winter wheat is at the nd stage of its plant development and winter triticale at the late nd and early rd stages of organogenesis The growing point is healthy with its length at mm In winter triticale it is mm long depending on the cultivar and predecessor The tillering coefficient varies within Winter rye is at the rd stage of organogenesis tillering Its growing point is healthy mm long The tillering coefficient is at The sugar content in tillering nodes of winter cereal plants varies within depending on the cultivar and predecessor According to specialists the content of soluble carbohydrates in soft wheat and rye is still enough for normal overwintering It enables wheat and rye plants to endure temperatures of up to C and respectively Durum winter wheat plants contained of soluble sugars indicating a frost hardiness decline to C Winter barley contains of sugars that poses a threat of winterkill if soil temperature falls to C at the tillering node depth In the northeast of Ukraine winter wheat of early and optimum planting dates contains on average of soluble sugars in tillering nodes In general the sugar content dropped in all cultivars This state of winter cereals requires constant monitoring Special attention should be paid to the sugar consumption dynamics the state of growing points soil temperature at the tillering node depth and emergence and spread of diseases Once the snow cover is gone winter cereals should be examined to determine their need for nitrogen fertilizers In the course of multi year studies and observations it has been established that in case of optimum overwintering conditions plants in well developed crops are to be sampled for analysis on the following three dates January February and March In case of adverse weather additional samples should be taken every time after significant temperature drops a long stay of compact ice crust and after long thaws An important factor influencing this year s condition of winter cereals will be the time of spring growth resumption If this happens from March with gradually increasing above zero air temperatures even non tillered crops will be able to increase the density of productive stalks due to spring tillering processes If spring growth resumes at the long term average period late March April with a rapid temperature build up the state of sparse crops will not improve and winter crop yields will likely decline Out of the planted Th ha winter crops for grain emerged on Th ha by February of these plantings are in good condition are satisfactory while weak sparse crops account for of area More weak plantings are in the south of the country in Odesa in Kirovohrad and in Mykolaiv regions In the rest of Ukraine almost of crops are in good and satisfactory condition AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult Taking into account specific weather in the fall phytosanitary condition of winter crops is mostly satisfactory and manageable In isolated areas murine rodents are populating the field margins Crops are slightly infested by Septoria blight and powdery mildew up to of plants GRAIN MARKET NEWS Topic of the week Does Europe need Ukrainian corn The research conducted by UkrAgroConsult shows that fundamental change in global markets unfortunately has not virtually influenced the strategy of the agrarian sector of Ukraine The main attention is still focused on the increase in grain production volume while low attention is given to profitability and efficiency of this industry UkrAgroConsult has already analyzed the situation when European countries reduced the imports of Ukrainian corn in the season compared to last season Rich own harvest as well as import duties have provoked the reduction of Ukrainian grain supply to the EU During October January Ukraine shipped only MMT of corn in this direction in comparison with MMT during the same time period last season In the context of significant devaluation Ukraine needs high export revenues Experience of the previous ten years shows that customers from the EU are quite unreliable importers and their activity depends on level of their own production Besides the USA claims a great interest in this market and currently discussing the creation of a free trade zone with EU There is an opinion in the market that old economies are trying to strengthen by means of limiting the access of young economies to their territory Therefore the trend of globalization which has been so much discussed in recent years is currently not so popular Quite the opposite there are signs of regionalization of the world economic community The decline of crude oil prices may boost the trend for the growing role of regional markets besides the EU is a good example of such a regional market In view of cheapness of traditional fuel bioethanol production becomes less profitable In early February ethanol stocks in the USA broke the two year record contributing to further reduction of prices and profitability of processing corn and other raw materials into ethanol Even before the collapse of crude oil prices a trend of decline of industrial grain consumption was observed in the USA Currently this trend may become a strongly pronounced tendency The preserved trend of production increase may aggravate the problem In other words the export potential of US corn production industry continues growing and competition for buyers is also rising Stiffer competition creates new methods and forms of struggle for markets Production and industrial consumption of corn in the USA MMT In this context the prices of grain and oilseeds continue decreasing In mid February the USDA published their first price forecast for grain of the harvest In particular it is expected that AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult farmers prices for corn will average bushel in the season This price is lower than in the current season and the lowest since The prices for soybean will reach the nine year minimum level according to the forecast It is also difficult for Ukraine to struggle for market outlets but its position of corn exporter is gradually strengthening not least because of geographic regional proximity to consumers At least it was until Corn exports KMT Certainly under such conditions the main battle will be for payable markets which show growth in consumption or at least its stabilization China is the first country which is traditionally regarded as a country of rising demand The trend of growing demand in this country is strongly pronounced though grain stocks are still considerable The similar situation is observed in other Asian countries although the demand is much lower there Experts of UkrAgroConsult have appraised the situation and come to conclusion that increase of demand and main battle for market share will develop in Asia region regionalization again Corn consumption MMT A positive point for such commodity exporters like Ukraine lies in changing policy of China in agriculture China intends to reduce grain production in favor of livestock vegetable farming and other industries producing goods with high added value This may provoke some increase in grain imports However the competition for customers will be also severe Ukraine should put most efforts to fulfill the existing and make new contracts in this market In the end we would like to point out three main competitive advantages which have traditionally supported the position of Ukrainian grain low prices GMO free products and favorable logistics These are those advantages which will help Ukraine to win the strategic struggle in changing business conditions Elizabeth Malyshko Grain market expert UkrAgroConsult AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult Weekly summary World market Wheat CBOT Egypt s tender to purchase wheat was the main event of last week Initially GASC intended to buy US wheat using a special tranche However the grain was not purchased due to high prices This fact proved low competitiveness of US grain On the other hand the international tender held by Egypt demonstrated high competitive power of European grain Taking advantage of relatively low prices a number of countries continue purchasing wheat in tenders which predominantly confirm the attractiveness of European especially French wheat FranceAgriMer has raised the estimate of French wheat exports outside the EU due to high supplies to Egypt in the current season The export is expected to reach MMT MMT in the January forecast For the first time this season will make the EU the leading exporter of wheat to world markets According to USDA estimates the EU will export about MMT of wheat in the current season shifting the USA to the second place with exports at MMT Volatility of quotations at CBOT reflected the Egyptian defeat of US wheat only partially Speculative and weather factors as well as rising quotations of corn appeared to be bullish factors Consequently last week wheat futures even managed to increase EU FranceAgriMer has released a forecast in which the planted area of soft wheat in France for the harvest will be expanded by to Ml ha It is also expected that the planted area of hard wheat will increase by to Ml ha It should be noted that there is lack of hard wheat supply in France this season which is compensated by imports particularly from Canada Canadian hard wheat exports to Western Europe have increased by about to MMT Canada has significantly increased wheat exports to Middle East Europe and South America During the five months of the current season Canadian exporters have supplied MMT of soft wheat to foreign buyers This is more than during the same time period in the season Asian countries were the main destinations of Canadian wheat exports Wheat supply to Middle East has increased considerably by in comparison with the last season to Western Europe by and to South America by India This year gross crop of grain in India will decrease to MMT forecasts the Ministry of Agriculture Last year India gathered a record high grain harvest MMT The production will decline mainly due to less precipitation during the monsoon season Wheat production in India is expected to reach MMT which is close to last year s level MMT Corn CBOT Last week CBOT corn quotations increased by T due to high export sales during the previous week Information about the possible reduction of corn planted area in favor of soybean and other agricultural crops somewhat supported the market at the end of last week Nevertheless fundamentally CBOT corn prices continue to suffer from high global supply AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult Argentina Rains in some regions of Argentina delayed harvesting of new crop corn By February farmers had gathered corn from Th ha or of the planted area Recent rains are favorable for plantings of corn which harvest time has not come yet According to the forecast of Buenos Aires Exchange gross crop of corn may reach MMT This is less than the record level of the season USDA has published its first forecast of planted area for the harvest It is expected that the acreage of major agri crops will decrease due to low prices Corn planted area will be reduced to Ml acres Ml acres compared with the current season wheat planted area to Ml acres Ml acres Farmers prices for corn are forecasted to average bushel in the season This price is lower than in the current season and the lowest since Besides according to USDA report in December the consumption of corn for ethanol production increased by in the USA In December Ml bushels of corn was used for ethanol and spirit production compared to Ml bushels in November and Ml bushels in October Spain According to the Ministry of Agriculture imports of corn to the country decreased by The largest suppliers of wheat in December were the following France KMT the UK KMT and Sweden KMT Ukraine has taken the first place among corn suppliers KMT In in Republic of South Africa the gross crop of corn reached a record high level for the last years and reached MMT This year a significant reduction of corn production is expected in South Africa due to dry weather which is now observed in major corn producing regions Facts and Rumors Russia According to the Ministry of Agriculture about Ml ha of the planted Ml ha of winter crops are in poor condition due to the fact that plantings are thinned and emerged before the cold snap The forecast of the Ministry of Agriculture is in a wide range in grain production may reach from MMT with a large percentage of killed winter crops to MMT China is ready to extend corn

February February OILSEED MARKET Topic of the week Are investments in new plants justified when existing ones are on the brink of being stopped Reports about the construction of new oilseed crushing plants increasingly often appear in the market lately But this time contrary to the previous events it is planned to build crushers not for sunseed since sunseed processing capacities have long exceeded MMT a year The matter concerns soybean crushing If the construction plans have been announced back in early everything would look logical and correct in view of booming soybean production in Ukraine along with similarly booming world demand for processed products However the plans for building new plants look a bit bizarre this season in the current circumstances The point is that a paradoxical situation has developed in the market to date with a bumper soybean crop the existing crushers may just stop operation Domestic soybean prices increase every day exporters already pay UAH for soybeans in ports and this price may be no more topical next week The current soybean price is just unaffordable for many crushers and it is actually impossible to compete with exporters because soybean meal cake sales are aimed mostly to the domestic market Therefore unlike exporters they receive revenues in Hryvnias not dollars AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult To purchase soybeans at the market price soybean meal cake prices must be higher than now In turn this will entail growth of poultry meat prices and then in chain order a decline in poultry demand from consumers a decrease in poultry meat production a fall in demand for meal cake etc However apart from sky high soybea,,0,
 purchase prices  there are many other factors that may negatively impact the realization of the crusher construction plans  the hryvnia devaluation  inflation  a rise in borrowing costs due to high risks  and the hostilities after all  But this list is not exhaustive  Everyone has forgotten an important factor such as the      soybean crop  Due to a yield decline  it may be smaller than in      despite a possible expansion of plantings  Taking into account all the above mentioned  there is a risk that the declared construction plans will remain just on paper  However  if these plans are realized  soybean crushing capacities may grow at least by   MMT a year  then almost   MMT of soybeans will be needed for their loading  This means it will be difficult for soybean crushers to operate without protection against large scale exports  Julia Garkavenko Chief Expert of Oilseeds Vegoils Market UkrAgroConsult      Weekly summary   Crude oil price fluctuates around the mark of USD    MT

  over the reporting week  and closed Thursday s trading session down    at USD       barrel  The week under review started with a world oil price upturn due to a series of publications about cutting oil extraction by major international companies  However  the bullish trend broke in the middle of the week because the U S  Energy Department and API published information about expanding inventories of crude and oil products in the U S  So  according to the Department  U S  commercial inventories of crude oil and distillates reached an    year high of       Ml barrels on February     Moreover  despite a decreased number of oil producing wells  the United States has become the world s top country in terms of the oil production   it outstripped Russia by   Ml barrels a day  Goldman Sachs

announced on Thursday          soy plantings are to be    Ml acres  or down     Th ha from the previous year  It is worth adding that China s absence in the market due to long holidays in the country will put certain psychological pressure on prices in the coming days  The Chinese holidays will last until February     a substantial trade increase and price growth can be expected then    U S  According to the U S  National Oilseed Processors Association  soybean crushing amounted to       Ml bushels in January        a record volume for this time of year  It is up from      due to steady

Ukraine produced     KMT of sunflower oil  That was the lowest production level for this month since the         season  High prices for sunseed as well as decreasing export prices have provoked considerable reduction of sunseed crushers  margin  Together with unwillingness of farmers to sell raw material these factors were the major reasons for reduction of sunoil production  Since the

sinking   Ukrainian Azov Sea ports continue operation World market Baltic Exchange Indices The dry bulk shipping index hit a new all time low of     points this week  The indicator is pulled down by

shipping market  In the opinion of Drewry  the bulk market will remain under pressure in Q        At the same time  stronger demand is expected for booking new type ships  which consume less fuel and

buyers but they re being stymied by a dearth of available starter homes Nationwide the inventory of homes costing or less fell more than percent between June and June according to the National

528,SEE ALSO Tax Free Income Sources to Supplement Retirement What does the largest overhaul of the tax code in a generation mean to you and how does it affect your planning While this is a highly complex and voluminous law read on for first impressions Changes to the Income Tax Brackets Under the new law the individual tax brackets are set at and What this means for your planning You and your advisers should quickly review what marginal bracket you will be in for vs This may impact the advisability of deferring income or accelerating deductions depending on which year will provide the greatest benefit Personal Exemptions and Standard Deductions The new law eliminates deductions for personal exemptions while increasing standard deductions to for single filers and for married joint filers The following well known itemized deductions are being modified or eliminated The deduction for state and local income sales and property taxes is capped at The deduction for mortgage interest is reduced and only allowable on up to of acquisition indebtedness note that mortgages incurred on or before Dec are grandfathered in and thus still allowed million of acquisition indebtedness The home equity loan interest deduction is repealed Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct medical expenses if they exceed of adjusted gross income instead of for tax years and What this means for your planning Be mindful of how the loss of personal exemptions affect your taxable income For those of you who are used to deducting sizable state and local income taxes work with your advisers to determine if accelerating the payment of state and local property taxes makes sense Those no longer allowed to deduct state income taxes should speak to their advisers about alternative solutions to avoid or mitigate state income taxes If possible you may wish to accelerate medical expenses into and to take advantage of the lower of AGI limitation Charitable Income Tax Deductions The new law increases the charitable contribution limit to of AGI for cash contributions up from now while keeping the limit on contributions of appreciated property at of AGI What this means for your planning If you will no longer itemize you may wish to consider a contribution to a donor advised fund before the end of the year where you can make a charitable contribution and receive an immediate tax benefit Individual Alternative Minimum Tax AMT The AMT exemption is increased to for single filers and for married joint filers The thresholds for the phase out of the AMT exemptions are increased to for single filers and million for married joint filers What this means for your planning Those of you with incentive stock options should consult with your advisers to time the exercise of these options in years they are not subject to AMT due to higher exemptions Estate Tax TCJA does not repeal the estate tax as was proposed in the House version however it doubles the estate gift and GST tax exemption amounts from the original million which has grown to million in and which will be million in due to adjustments for inflation to million which when adjusted for inflation is million in The Unified Exemption which is the gift and estate tax exemption combined meaning if you use the exemption for gifting it will reduce the amount you can use for the estate tax will be million per person It s double that per couple and the surviving spouse may use any unused portion left over from the spouse first to die It also provides for increases to the exemptions based on inflation The exemption sunsets after What this means for your planning With the exemption set this high only a tiny fraction of families will be affected by estate taxes However for those that are affected it is an enormous tax bite at This can easily destroy a closely held business or large family farm and for those affected it will definitely undermine family legacy goals This means planning is still critical for families with large closely held businesses or those that have a net worth significantly greater than the exemption amounts Considering that barring further congressional action the exemption amounts will revert back to million for individuals in So planning now while the gift tax exemption is doubled for the next several years may be crucial Make sure to discuss these matters with your adviser Clients who purchased life insurance to finance the payment of estate and other taxes and expenses should think carefully before canceling or reducing coverage If your estate does not now nor is ever likely to exceed the inflation indexed exemption amount s using the new found exemption amounts to un wind life insurance premium financing and note sale transactions may be attractive Making large gifts to irrevocable life insurance trusts ILITs that have dynastic provisions could also be worth exploring Estate tax planning is still required for those who live in states that have decoupled and instituted their own state estate tax In many cases the state exemption may be significantly lower than the federal amount Business Income Tax Changes Unlike the changes affecting personal income tax most of the changes affecting business income are permanent Corporate Income Taxes The corporate income tax is reduced to down from and corporate alternative minimum tax is repealed What this means for your planning Premiums on corporate owned life insurance should be lower while death benefits received by a corporation from a life insurance policy it owns may be more effective All arrangements involving corporate payment of life insurance premiums should be reviewed See Also Keep More of Your Retirement Savings with Tax Bracket Planning Pass Through Businesses TCJA provides for a deduction on non wage portions of pass through income In short and simply stated if the pass through income for a married couple is or less for single filers then the deduction is limited to of the W wages or in the case of a business that requires capital a non personal service business of W wages plus of the adjusted cost basis of the assets Architects and engineers have been exempted from these limitations Pass through income exceeding the thresholds receives no deduction In practice this means that pass through businesses partnerships LLCs S corporations and sole proprietorships filing a Schedule C will be effectively taxed on only of their pass through income or put another way on only of their normal rate on all business income What this means for your planning Planners and business owners will need to revisit how a client s business should be structured and operated and re evaluate the pros and cons of pass through entities in the light of the law dropping the C Corporation rate to and changing the long standing approach of taxing pass through business income at individual tax rates Numerical comparisons are essential You should talk to your adviser about finding the lowest tax bracket party to pay for needed life insurance and about split dollar life insurance to remove equity out of a business while minimizing current income tax The step up in basis is retained so assets held in your taxable estate at death will receive a new stepped up tax basis This is very valuable especially in the high tax states such as New York California Illinois and Hawaii so make sure you do the math before moving your low basis appreciating assets out of your estates Careful planning and flexible dynasty trusts like the HYCET Trust will be vitally important Other Tax Provisions TCJA contains many other provisions The following is a brief summary of some of them most relevant to most people Full expensing of investments in new depreciable assets made after Sept and before Jan will be permitted There is a per year phase down of the full expensing for property placed in service after Dec and before Jan The limit on section deductions wherein businesses can deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and or software purchased or financed during the tax year is increased to million Deductions for certain fringe benefits such as business entertainment expenses have been limited Net operating loss NOL deductions are limited to of pre NOL taxable income There is an indefinite NOL carryforward but no carryback to prior years for most companies A three year holding period is required for a carried interest to qualify as a long term capital asset The itemized deduction for personal casualty losses would be restricted to losses incurred in a presidentially declared disaster area This sunsets after Tax preparation fees are no longer deductible This sunsets after Except for members of the armed forces moving expenses are no longer deductible This sunsets after Reversing or re characterizing a Roth IRA is no longer permitted The penalty for failing to maintain minimum health care coverage is effectively eliminated starting Jan Plans can be used for K schools and for homeschooling The alimony deduction for the payor ex spouse and the inclusion of alimony in gross income of the recipient ex spouse is repealed for any divorce or separation instrument executed or modified after Dec Conclusion We have just seen the first major tax change since It may be years before the broader ramifications of TCJA are known but it is fairly certain to impact most all Americans Be that as it may much remains to be seen Will the new law result in meaningful higher wages new jobs and business growth Will it help middle or lower income Americans to any meaningful extent Will it dangerously increase the deficit Will it weaken social safety nets What is certain is that in the end whatever is done can be eventually undone when the political climate changes Most of the provisions affecting individual as opposed to corporate taxpayers sunset after and if the other party is in power at that time you can most predictably expect the lower tax provisions not to be extended Accordingly it seems safe to say that none of this is will be permanent as permanent fixes are never permanent so long as future Congresses can make changes This is why executives professionals business owners high income and high net worth individuals and families will always benefit from planning advice and expertise to understand their options See Also The Retiree Tax Quiz

542,County Counsel Leroy Smith said the county s position is that the commission s decision is not final until next Monday at the earliest and the effective date could be extended indefinitely depending on action by the courts or the commission We re reviewing the decision and seeing what the next step is he said The independent commission ordered the county to reinstate Towner to the job he lost in April after finding the county had failed to meet its burden of proof regarding any of the factual charges stated in Towner s termination notice He should receive full back pay and benefits the commission said The charges of dishonesty discourteous treatment of employees failure of good behavior and action incompatible with and inimical to public service are therefore not sustained says a written decision and order signed a week ago by commission Chairman James Vandenberg The document which The Star obtained Thursday from the pension board is consistent with the verbal comments from Towner s attorney following the commission s ruling in late June It provides the written language of the order and decision for the first time but most of the contents were redacted under a state Supreme Court decision that says disciplinary cases involving law enforcement officers are confidential Towner s attorney Bill Hadden said Thursday that he was not releasing the written ruling because it is a confidential personnel document The commission s legal counsel Grant Burton said that even if Towner wanted to waive that right he may not be able to because other officers in the DA s Office with privacy rights are discussed in the ruling The county has argued that the commission should have recused itself and appointed an independent hearing officer because the panel had already found Towner credible in a previous hearing Hadden though has said the decision is still up to the commission The decision to fire Towner was made by top officials in the District Attorney s Office The agency is part of the tax funded county government but operates independently in large measure because DA Greg Totten is an elected official Towner rejoined the pension board early this week after an absence of months while his appeal was being heard and decided He was the elected alternate representative of public safety employees but could not serve after he was fired because he was no longer a county employee The pension board officially called the Board of Retirement had agreed at his request not to call an election to replace him pending the outcome of his appeal Towner was also chairman of the pension board which oversees a billion retirement system that largely benefits county government employees and their families Trustee Bill Wilson who has been filling the post in Towner s absence said he expected the board would vote at its next regular meeting on Sept to reinstate Towner as chairman In a statement that Towner made to the trustees on July a few days after winning his appeal he thanked the panel and staff of the retirement system for their patience while his appeal was pending according to board minutes He said the wait may not be over based on the reception he received when he showed up for work at the DA s Office shortly before a m the morning after his victory Towner said that after he sat in the agency s lobby for almost two hours his lawyer was told to contact the DA s outside legal counsel The DA s attorney said he would respond after receiving and reviewing the commission s written decision which was pending at the time according to Towner s statement Wilson said the fact that Towner had been turned away from the DA s Office was not an issue for the pension board We take our instruction from the Civil Service Commission he said Wilson said the fact that the document was heavily redacted was not an issue for the pension trustees either All they needed to know is that he was ordered reinstated he said Smith said the county has days to ask the commission to reconsider its decision a deadline that elapses Monday If the county does not file such a motion the decision becomes final then he said The local government has days to appeal the decision to the courts Smith said Smith declined comment on whether any settlement talks were underway Towner claimed he had been fired for telling the truth about three officers he indicated had collaborated to cheat an employee out of a promotion DA officials claimed his testimony was dishonest and merited dismissal A hearing panel consisting of Vandenberg and Commissioners Alyse Lazar Don Becker and Patricia Parham voted unanimously to grant the appeal Kathleen Wilson covers the Ventura County government including the county health system politics and social services Reach her at kathleen wil son vcstar com or,"The District Attorney's Office has not allowed ousted Cmdr.

543,Co founder and CEO Jordan Lewis said the new site will assist landlords in finding quality tenants and also give a voice to tenants to submit a lower offer if they have those strong qualities in the hopes a landlord would choose them over the highest bidder We want tenants to be able to negotiate on pricing said Lewis who has an engineering background Right now the tenant has no voice There were more than suites listed on the site recently almost all in Vancouver with suggested rents as high as a month for a two bedroom in Coal Harbour The cheapest rent was for a square foot studio on Kingsway The recently renovated Oceancrest Apartments at Jervis and Harwood streets listed all suites on biddwell com said Lewis Jay Lirag who manages the Oceancrest on behalf of owners and investors said he elected to use biddwell com exclusively for finding tenants because it was difficult to determine what to charge for his luxury suites because rents vary wildly in the super heated market with a vacancy rate of less than one per cent We wanted to know what is the market willing to bear and what do they tenants want to pay Lirag said He added all the suites are freshly renovated and have an ensuite washer dryer The building is a block from the beach The Oceancrest website listed suggested rents starting at for a junior one bedroom to for a two bedroom and for the penthouse suite We re catering to people who really want to live there said Lirag who knows of one square foot studio in a year old West End building which requires repairs that rents for He said feedback from potential tenants indicated Oceancrest is on the right track with its suggested rents He and Lewis insisted the sealed bids prevent bidding wars The site allows prospective tenants to send landlords a rental resume along with their bid and gives them the opportunity to sell themselves and even negotiate a lower rent he said What is important is not only the rent said Lirag We need to get returns on investors money but it s not only the rent that matters to us it s the quality of tenant He said tenants could bid below the suggested rents but an email sent to prospective tenants warns Please be aware there may be multiple groups interested in the specific unit that you want And an association that represents owners and managers including those at Oceancrest worry the website and pending app are a recipe for driving rents up which is already happening with traditional ads LandlordBC has concerns about any app that would facilitate or could encourage bidding wars said David Hutniak of LandlordBC Our concern is that is what could very well happen with this app It s going to make it more challenging for tenants to find affordable housing said Hutniak He said landlords are looking for long term stable tenants and said if tenants are forced to pay higher rents it would encourage tenant turnover and drive up landlords costs It bidding is not good for anyone Hutniak said Just because the bids are sealed doesn t mean it s not a bidding war said Andrew Sakamoto executive director of the Tenant Resource and Advisory Centre which advocates for tenants There are still going to be outrageous bids that some tenants aren t going to be able to afford It s still going to drive rents up He called it the commodification of housing that needs to be further regulated He said landlords should be able to make a profit from their properties but there has to be a balance We don t allow price gouging Tenants have a right to find housing at a reasonable price Rents have skyrocketed in the past year and Sakamoto said there needs to be some mechanisms in place to keep them in check such as a ban on the loophole of six month tenancy contracts with vacate clauses that some landlords are using to do an end run around limits to rental increases per cent set by the province in Lewis said the online service which is being developed into a mobile app will also allow landlords to collect potential tenants on a waiting list on the biddwell com site and offer renters virtual reality tours of the available suites Rentberry a similar app in San Francisco charges tenants to register to use the site and doesn t seal the bids They re Rentberry the Hunger Games for the rental market and they re very much on the side of the landlord said Lewis They want to maximize ROI return on investment for the landlord He said biddwell com would advocate for the tenant but said the revenue for the site would eventually come from landlords He didn t see a conflict of interest He said since the launch a month ago the site has registered users per cent of which are tenants He said he s had interest from Toronto Edmonton Squamish and Whistler to expand the service to those cities He plans to eventually expand to the U S slazaruk postmedia com mailto slazaruk postmedia com,"A Vancouver-based online service that helps landlords rent suites through sealed bids from tenants is strongly opposed by LandlordBC because they fear it's going to encourage bidding wars and make it even tougher for renters.

544,One spouse may have enjoyed much greater investing success than the other One may have lots of disposable income while the other may have to rely on taxable distributions Out of pocket health care costs are likely to increase and be unequal And if spouses don t communicate properly conflicting ideas about spending on travel helping family and leisure activities can create disagreements and other unpleasant issues Tamra Stern a partner at Main Street Research LLC in Sausalito Calif recalls a wife who retired at age and started spending so heavily on travel and other purchases that she had to go back to work for years to avoid being solely reliant on her husband s individual retirement account Of course every couple s situation is different But here are a few categories that couples with separate finances typically need to address Health care Before retiring couples should determine what their Medicare and private health care premiums are going to be Once the premiums and estimates of out of pocket costs are known this should lead to a discussion about how these expenses will be treated Will they be shared household expenses and split equally or should each spouse pay for his or her own medical costs If one spouse appears likely to run out of money due to rising health care expenses in retirement this needs to be addressed Does the other spouse begin to pick up most or all of the joint expenses to keep the couple afloat financially Income sources Couples need to consider how their asset allocations will affect their ability to pay their expenses If one spouse is mostly dependent on a k for income he or she might run down this savings sooner because the distributions are taxable Steve Janachowski chief executive of Brouwer Janachowski a registered investment adviser in Mill Valley Calif offers the real life example of a couple in their s While they were working each earned sufficient income to split their expenses evenly But after retirement the husband became concerned about running out of money While he had saved million in a profit sharing plan that he rolled over into an IRA using that money to pay for his expenses would cost him almost half from a tax perspective His wife was in a far better position since she had recently received an inheritance of million in after tax money in a trust and in an inherited IRA The couple decided to draw down the wife s after tax account to pay for expenses so their IRAs could continue growing tax deferred Social Security benefits can be another tricky area for couples with separate finances to navigate To maximize benefits married couples need to coordinate how and when each spouse should start collecting benefits Strategies can differ depending on their respective ages and means and could have implications for each spouse s ability to pay their share of expenses Thus the options need to be discussed advisers say Gifts to family Once they are no longer earning a paycheck couples may need to reconsider how they are gifting money to children and grandchildren says Keith Moeller a wealth management adviser at Northwestern Mutual in Minneapolis Making separate gifts may not have been a concern during their working years But before retirement a couple should discuss what happens if one spouse can no longer afford to give as much Is the other spouse willing to pick up the slack and should other expense sharing be adjusted as a result Other insurance Separate marital finances may make life and long term care insurance more necessary Mr Moeller says he works with a couple who are years apart in age They were concerned that if the husband needed long term care the wife would be burdened financially and emotionally It might also deplete her personal assets and severely diminish the inheritance she hoped to leave to her children from a previous marriage So the husband decided to buy long term care insurance to help protect her in the event he had an extended need for care Many advisers and clients assume life insurance won t be needed in retirement but it may be necessary to help a surviving spouse pay bills Ideally the couple would have purchased a permanent life policy at a younger age so the cash outlay wouldn t be as steep Mr Moeller says but adds that even in retirement it may be advisable to buy permanent life or term insurance He offers the hypothetical example of a couple splitting the mortgage evenly If the husband s assets are all earmarked for his children from a previous marriage the wife might need the life insurance money to pay her share of the bills once the husband is no longer contributing Mr Moeller calls this the survivor income stress test and says many couples fail to consider how the death of a spouse would affect their ability to pay their share of the expenses Travel patterns With more free time in retirement one spouse might prefer to be frequently on the go while the other is more of a homebody Couples need to consider how they are going to divvy up the expenses as changes occur says Tony D Amico chief executive and senior wealth adviser at Fidato Wealth LLC a registered investment adviser in Strongsville Ohio He recalls a couple where each spouse had children from prior marriages They started retirement by splitting their travel budget But the wife had more grandchildren and they found themselves traveling to visit her family more frequently The solution Mr D Amico says was for her to cover the cost of their airfare and for him to pay their dining out expenses When couples are creative they can often find compromises that suit both spouses Mr D Amico gives another example of a retired couple who had been married for more than years In his working years the husband frequently traveled internationally and he wanted to spend his retirement hunting fishing and camping His wife however had a hankering to travel internationally but didn t have the resources Their resolution He footed the bill for her once a year trip to an international destination He also bought a camper so they could take trips together and do some of the things he enjoyed Ms Munk is a writer in West Orange N J Email reports wsj com,"For some married couples, keeping separate accounts poses no problems during their working years. But in retirement, it can require some rethinking.

Many couples keep at least some assets separate in retirement, often to preserve assets for children of prior marriages. There can also be a desire to continue the financial independence they've grown accustomed to. But once couples with separate accounts enter the drawing-down stage of their financial lives, rules and sharing agreements that once made sense may no longer apply.",1,
545,Here s a rundown of how all this will work People who have health insurance For the vast majority of Americans tax filing under the Affordable Care Act will be as simple as checking a box to show they had health coverage all year said Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew On Line of the tax form you must indicate that you your spouse if you re filing a joint return and your dependents had health insurance last year If you bought health insurance through the health insurance marketplace you will receive IRS Form A Health Insurance Marketplace Statement from the exchange It will list which members of the household were covered and for how long as well as premium costs and any advance payment you received for premium tax credits If you got the tax credit you will need to file Form Premium Tax Credit with your tax return You will need information from Form A to fill out Form Taxpayers claiming an exemption from the penalty for not having health insurance A fraction of taxpayers will take different steps like claiming an exemption if they could not afford insurance Lew said Those seeking an exemption must file Form Health Coverage Exemptions with their tax return It lists the possible exemptions and lets you claim the one that might apply Those who chose not to obtain coverage and now must pay a penalty A smaller fraction of taxpayers will pay a fee if they made a choice to not obtain coverage they could afford Lew said The penalty for is per person with a family maximum of or percent of your yearly income whichever is higher Only the amount of income above the tax filing threshold about for an individual is used to calculate the penalty Your filing threshold is the minimum amount of gross income a person your age and filing status must make to be required to file a tax return Many people still believe that the penalty is per person said Kathy Pickering executive director of the H R Block Tax Institute If you ve got a couple that s making a year and the spouse didn t get insurance now they re thinking it s But when they come in to do the calculation they re going to learn that the penalty is actually and that s a lot higher than the they might have been expecting The penalty for not having health insurance increases every year For it will be per person with a maximum of for a family or percent of your yearly income Those who received advance payments of the premium tax credit The premium tax credit is for certain consumers who bought health insurance through the health insurance marketplace and it reduces the amount of tax owed The government makes advance payments of the credit to help consumers pay a share of their monthly health insurance premiums The advance payments are based on an estimate of the credit that you will claim on this year s tax return That estimate is based on a formula that takes into account income household size and health insurance costs in your community Those who got too much of a subsidy will see their tax refunds reduced by the IRS For example you will get dinged if your income went up during the year and you didn t report that to HealthCare gov or to your health insurance exchange If you received less of a subsidy than you were entitled to the IRS will owe you instead This part is going to trip up many taxpayers When people went to the marketplace to sign up for insurance at that point they were estimating what they thought their income was going to be Pickering said Now they re filing their tax return with what it actually was and in many cases it s going to be different because life events change your household income You may have gotten a better job you have lost your job gotten married got divorced All of those kinds of things impact the household income then that impacts the amount of premium tax credit that you re eligible for Some will be taken aback if they have to repay the credit When they were enrolling in the insurance they thought of that as just a discount on their insurance premium Pickering said They didn t think of it as this is something they might have to pay back if they got too much Don t expect too much help from the IRS Commissioner John Koskinen warned Congress that budget cuts could hamper taxpayer services this filing season,"Filing your federal income taxes this year will be most interesting.

That's because this is the first time Americans will experience the complex connections between the Affordable Care Act and taxes.",0,

investors have been conditioned to only play the market one way buy stocks and hope they go up That s been a very profitable game to be sure but it s not the only one And for investors who are more conservative for instance those who are at or near retirement there is a lot of value in thinking about capital preservation strategies as well as those that tap into growth If that kind of strategy appeals to you here are five tactical ETFs that could act as insurance against a market decline They may never deliver dramatic gains and in roaring bull market you will certainly leave some profit on the table But much like medical insurance that feels like a waste of money until you find yourself in the hospital these ETFs will provide peace of mind and protection if and when the unexpected happens Direxion S P Bear X Shares Aggressive traders are probably familiar with the Direxion family of funds chock full of leveraged offerings that allow you to play three times the movement of a group of stocks These investments are interesting ways to supercharge your profits in a surging market but risk delivering three times the pain in a market that s crashing But amid its portfolio of X funds Direxion has one of the best ways for individual investors to hedge against a stock market decline in its Direxion S P Bear X Shares fund SPDN US It holds futures and short positions on S P stocks in an aim to deliver the opposite results of the index For instance while the S P is up about in the last months through Thursday this ETF is down nearly To be clear this is not a great way to make boatloads of money from a stock market decline If you re looking to do that trade put options or take a peek at the Direxion s more aggressive inverse funds But if you simply want to soften the blow of a marketwide slump on your overall portfolio putting a small portion of your cash in this downside fund could be a good hedging strategy AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF One of the more sophisticated ETFs that lets you invest like a hedge fund is the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF HDGE US It is dedicated to short selling stocks but unlike the broad based Direxion fund it focuses on companies that seem to be struggling for specific reasons For instance the fund now is betting against stagnant consumer staples company Kellogg K US motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson HOG US and social media company Snap SNAP US among others Thanks to this tactical approach the ETF is up about year to date through Thursday while the S P has notched only a small gain Obviously a bull market that charges benignly higher is bad for any short side fund and this one is still about in the red over the last months vs the gain or so for the S P But unlike with the Direxion S P Bear X Shares fund you re not seeing a hard inverse correlation Considering the choppiness lately and the way sectors seem to be diverging it may not be a bad idea to let the AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear managers handpick some dogs and bet against them as a way to keep your head above water in a down market Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF While there s something to be said for taking a portion of your assets and simply setting them aside most investors can t stomach conventional cash like options Money market funds offer next to nothing in returns while high yield CDs still barely crack in annual yield and require you to tie up your money If you want the liquidity and security of cash but want to generate something with your money the Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF MINT US offers a great alternative Focused on short term bonds with of its holdings with less than a year in duration and the other currently in maturities of one to three years it avoids some of the long tail risk from rising interest rates And since the fund is actively managed holding a wide variety of bonds including everything from emerging market debt to investment grade corporate bonds to government paper it can make tactical bets that provide modest yield without undue risk The result is an ETF that has stayed remarkably flat from a per share perspective trading between and since but delivering about in annual yield That s about the same return as a CD but with the option to sell whenever you want This is certainly not a fund that will ever provide significant growth But if you want cash like stability with a modest yield with liquidity that will allow you to access that money whenever you see fit it s is a very interesting option Vanguard Short Term Inflation Protected Securities ETF As the name implies the Vanguard Short Term Inflation Protected Securities ETF VTIP US is a direct play on Treasury inflation protected securities or TIPS This fund admittedly has a pretty disappointing record lately but it may serve a useful role going forward for those looking to hedge in this volatile market Sure the fearmongers who talked up hyperinflation risks in the wake of the Great Recession have ultimately been proven painfully wrong The annualized rate of inflation hasn t been higher than since the end of and hasn t topped since early before the financial crisis was in full swing That has led to a pretty terrible return for TIPS a special kind of government bond that is indexed to inflation But all the talk lately of inflation concerns may mean the time for this ETF is coming around There is a very real chance that current inflation fears like those of years past are overblown But as an insurance policy it may be worth a look iShares Gold Trust ETF I m not na ve enough to think that gold GCJ US is truly a safe haven asset Nor do I think it s at all realistic that gold will ever be used widely as currency But if you re looking for an uncorrelated asset to the equities market gold GLD US does have a lot to offer as a hedge because it is incredibly independent of stocks and one way to play it is the iShares Gold Trust ETF IAU US For those unfamiliar with the vagaries of correlation if two assets move completely in sync in the same direction they will show a correlation coefficient of positive and if they always move in opposite directions they will show a correlation of A correlation reading of zero means obviously there is no correlation and the assets move independently While different time periods admittedly yield different results over the last three years gold has had a correlation coefficient of roughly negative A perfect zero correlation is all but impossible in the real world so gold may be as close as you can find to an asset that is independent of the stock market this year More on the stock market The Fed s Powell inadvertently gave a rare stock tip in his testimony These experts warn that another

risk of your rate increasing down the line with an ARM It may be in your best interest to secure a low rate while possible provided your finances are in order Today s mortgage rates Tuesday February Mortgage type Average rate today Average rate last week year fixed year fixed ARM ARM Rates from Ad Practitioners LLC The rates for year fixed mortgages have remained flat since last Tuesday while year fixed mortgage rates have increased marginally Adjustable mortgage rates have increased as well and all rates remain at historic lows overall We re supplying you with the national average rates for conventional mortgages which may be what you consider normal mortgages You may be eligible for a lower rate with a government backed mortgage through the FHA VA or USDA Mortgage rates are at

refinance rates Tuesday February Mortgage type Average rate today Average rate last week year fixed year fixed ARM ARM Rates from Ad Practitioners LLC Refinance rates on adjustable rate mortgages have gone up since last Tuesday with the ARM rate increasing by basis points Fixed mortgage rates have gone down slightly How do year fixed mortgage rates work If you take out a year fixed mortgage it will take you years to pay off your mortgage and you ll pay the same interest rate the whole time You ll cough up more per month with a year fixed mortgage than with a year term because it will take you half the time to pay off the equivalent loan principal However you ll pay less overall with a year term than a year fixed mortgage You ll pay off the mortgage years earlier and you ll get a lower interest rate How do year fixed mortgage rates work If you take out a year fixed mortgage you ll pay down your loan over three decades at a locked in interest rate Your interest rate will be higher with a year term than with a shorter term Additionally you ll pay more in interest with a year fixed mortgage than a year fixed mortgage because you re paying a higher interest rate for an extended period However your monthly payments will be smaller with a year term than with a year term because you re splitting up your payments over more years How do ARMs work With an adjustable rate mortgage you ll secure your rate for a predetermined amount of time Then your rate will fluctuate periodically A ARM locks in your rate for seven years then the rate will change once per year Even as ARM rates are currently at all time lows a fixed rate mortgage might still be the better deal You can lock in a low rate for the long term without chancing an increased ARM rate in the future If you re considering getting an ARM ask your lender what your individual rates would be if you chose a fixed rate versus an adjustable rate mortgage Ways to get a low mortgage rate It might be a good time to secure a low mortgage rate as both fixed and adjustable mortgage rates are at all time lows However there s no need to rush to apply for a mortgage or refinance Rates will probably remain low well

most important way to boost your credit score You can also consider paying down your debts or letting your credit age Save more for a down payment The smallest amount of money required for your down payment will be contingent on which type of mortgage you want The higher your down payment the better an interest rate you ll likely get Lower your debt to income ratio Your DTI ratio is the amount you pay toward debts each month divided by your gross monthly income Many lenders want to see a DTI ratio of or less To improve your ratio pay down debts or look for ways to boost your income You can

568,Instead the party confirmed it would reduce it from to just a move which would slash the amount the middle classes can pass on to their children The policy is not in the Labour manifesto but appears in a separate costings document The per cent inheritance tax rate is charged on the amount of the estate above the threshold meaning that under Labour s plans children inheriting from their parents would face an death tax bill Last night the Conservatives unveiled research showing that an extra million homes could be liable for the tax under Labour The number would more than double from under the Tory plan to almost million by under Mr Corbyn s proposal The Tories say the Labour bombshell will be far more damaging to pensioners than Conservative plans to charge some people more for social care They also claim Labour has secret plans to reduce the level even lower to a claim strongly denied by the party Last night housing minister Gavin Barwell said Millions of families who have worked hard and saved all their lives will see their homes dragged into Jeremy Corbyn s punishing tax The revelation came as The Tories lodged a furious complaint selection of a TV debate audience described by Boris Johnson as the most Left wing ever Labour confirmed it would rely on the SNP to put Mr Corbyn in power in the event of a hung parliament and refused to rule out seeking support from Sinn Fein Theresa May questioned Mr Corbyn s patriotism as she warned a successful Brexit could never be negotiated by a man who doesn t believe in Britain It emerged that Mr Corbyn has backed squatters groups who issued guidance on how to break into buildings Mrs May and Mr Corbyn prepared to field questions from the public in a live Question Time debate tonight The Tories have already increased the inheritance tax threshold from where it stood in when George Osborne s Budget pledged to increase it gradually over the years Under the Conservative policy the level is set to increase to million by Mr Corbyn has gone into the election saying he will reverse Mr Osborne s changes but the policy does not appear in the Labour manifesto instead being relegated to a separate costings document In a list of tax measures the costings document says it would be reversing tax giveaways on capital gains tax inheritance tax bank levy and scrapping the married persons tax allowance to raise billion It was only earlier this week that the party finally confirmed it would return the threshold to The Conservatives research is based on an analysis of million Land Registry residential transactions in It found that an estimated per cent of all homes in England and Wales are valued over By comparison per cent of homes are valued over million Taking inflation into account the Tories estimate that by per cent of homes will be worth more than and per cent more than million It will mean that under Labour s plans for a threshold about million family homes will be caught more than million more than under the Conservatives plans for a million threshold And the Conservatives are arguing that Labour want to go further and reduce the threshold to They say this is because both Mr Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell have previously opposed the rights for couples to be able to pay their inheritance tax allowance on to their spouse on death The Tory analysis finds that if the threshold is reduced to per cent of all homes would currently be hit equivalent to million homes in England and Wales Allowing for house price inflation this would rise to per cent of all homes by equivalent to million homes Mr Barwell said Jeremy Corbyn s manifesto contains a billion black hole and Labour will attempt to fill it using damaging taxes on family homes Corbyn and John McDonnell have made clear they want even more properties to become liable for inheritance tax if they win power Under their chaotic plans one in five homes across the country would be swept up in Labour s family homes tax Labour denied this say it planned only to reverse the threshold to The shock analysis comes a day after the Mail revealed that Mr Corbyn was considering a wealth tax to pay for social care On Wednesday economists said this suggested people would have to pay a French style annual tax on their investments such as property This is on top of Labour s manifesto commitment to hit those earning or more with higher income tax And earlier this week it emerged that council tax bills would treble under Labour plans for a garden tax The small print of Mr Corbyn s manifesto contains proposals to replace council tax and business rates with a Land Value Tax on homes and gardens Last night a Labour spokesman said The only figure for the number of estates that will have no

571,We are as busy as we have ever been with enquiries and viewings said Mark Harris of Savills Private Finance If you are someone with cash of or more of the purchase price mortgage rates have seldom been so attractive and our experience is that people are looking to invest How low can it go But will fixed rate mortgages come down further I don t believe it is worth waiting to see because the real issue for many homebuyers and even people remortgaging is the loan to value said Richard Roberts of Route Group We have seen cases turned down because the borrower couldn t meet the LTV and if prices carry on falling borrowers who now have equity in their homes won t be able to get the best deal if we see another drop in prices If you take the view that interest rates have probably bottomed out the new year fix from Chelsea Building Society looks interesting Chelsea is offering a year fix at fixed until April It is available for loans of up to of the property value and has a arrangement fee This is an ideal product for older homebuyers last time sellers who are probably not going to see any increase in their income and need to be able to budget Even if they subsequently decide to move house they can take the fixed rate loan with them so it isn t much of a restriction That is not to say that fixes could not come down further but there is no guarantee that they will Ten year swap rates now stand at Given that lenders are now building in a margin of around any long term fix at under looks a good deal Attractions for older buyers Most borrowers are wary of a long term commitment but for older homeowners who want some certainty this could be a once in a lifetime opportunity With the government going to the money markets to borrow billion or more over the next year it is debateable how long interest rates will stay low The lowest I can ever remember year fixes was back in when bank base rate BBR stood at and you could get a year fix at With lenders now wanting better margins any sub fix is going to look attractive said Ray Boulger of Charcols But I think rates could come down a bit further and I think there will be a window of several months to buy longer term fixes He believes that the recession will last longer than initially expected In the short term we could see fixed rates come down a bit but the government s borrowing requirement could push rates up quite sharply if we look a couple of years ahead The lure of low tracker rates Boulger pointed out that most people are seduced by the low tracker rates some at under First Direct for example has a very attractive lifetime tracker at BBR plus giving a pay rate of and the mortgage has an offset facility as well For anyone wondering what to do with spare cash an offset is the best use for this money But for most trackers the margin over BBR is around and lenders are now imposing early repayment penalties so new loans are not as flexible as old trackers When interest rates start to rise as they inevitably will those on trackers and short term fixes may not be able to opt out to take advantage of the longer term fixes Be wary of a BBR benchmark And Boulger warned against using BBR as a marker Not only do we have a disconnect between BBR and mortgage rates but we have a disconnect between BBR and the cost of lenders funds He suggested that a compromise could be the drop lock mortgages offered by Nationwide and C G which offer low rates now with the option to move into a fixed rate at a later date Both Nationwide and C G have traditionally been in the long term fixed rate market and have had reasonable rates in the past Although they may not be the best they are usually a good deal he pointed out For those who don t want to commit themselves for years the five year fix from HSBC at looks a good deal the more so because with shorter term fixes you incur ever increasing arrangement fees which push up the actual cost of offers with a lower headline rate The arrangement fee for the HSBC five year fix is Seize the moment Clients are aware that interest rates have probably bottomed out and are looking to take advantage of longer term fixes Although the five and year fixed rate products are only available to people with large deposits for those who meet the criteria and are happy to tie in for a longer period of time they are very competitive indeed and will bring real peace of mind said Sean Scahill mortgage expert at Optimal Wealth Management People know that interest rates can t go much lower and that locking in at this level will protect them against a sudden rise in the base rate when we finally do begin to exit the recession The clever money right now is definitely on the longer term fix although you clearly need to be aware of the early repayment charges he warns But Roberts maintained that price isn t everything Several of the best mortgages like the HSBC fix are available only direct from the lenders But HSBC has a pretty poor track record I have heard tales of it taking up to weeks to get an application accepted and a lot of our customers don t want that hassle The general feeling seems to be that fixed rates may come down a bit further but they may not And for anyone who needs the security of certainty now is probably as good a time as any to take the plunge and go for a longer term fix If you can get an offset at the same time then get certainty and a good return on your money,"The silver lining in the current credit crisis is fixed rate mortgages. They are cheap, there are lots of new offers and borrowers can lock into low interest rates for up to 10 years.

Among all the doom and gloom, there is one bright spark mortgage rates are really cheap and a raft of new fixed rate offers is giving the opportunity to lock into low rates for five or 10 years.",0,
572,Answers provided by Tom Seymour a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers Nicole Bryant director of employment and wealth group of PricewaterhouseCoopers Johanna Lowry taxation specialist with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia How you and your family will benefit Q Family payments I receive child support each month and also family benefit of a fortnight Because I receive the family benefit will I receive the family payment or will my partner get some of this A It would appear that given you are entitled to the family tax benefit you will be entitled to the full But I would wait until the Government issues more information before presuming you will receive the entire amount Q Family tax credit I currently receive fortnightly for three children and I am concerned about this becoming a lump sum payment at the end of the year Please advise if it is to remain fortnightly or to become lump sum A If you currently receive the family tax benefit Part A you will receive a one off payment for each child In addition from July the amount of the FTB will increase if you currently receive it as a fortnightly payment you should be able to continue to do so Q Family payments My husband earns a year and I earn We have two children born in and We missed out on the baby bonus the first time Are we going to miss out on the baby bonus again Also do our family payments increase now and by how much A The current baby bonus eligibility rules will apply to your second child you will need to speak to an accountant to find out if you will be eligible for it in your circumstances I expect that you are currently eligible for family tax benefit Part A If so you will be eligible for a one off bonus per child at the end of this financial year June Q Family tax benefit Can I confirm that eligible parents will receive up to per child under before June Then they will receive an extra per child after we put in our tax return for the financial year So there could be two payments of up to per child between now and say August A What you say is correct though the material about the bonus indicates it applies for each dependent child ie they need not be under However the ages of your children will be relevant in determining how much FTB you receive I don t believe the amount would be reduced to per cent Q FTB I work part time as a scientist and earn while my husband earns as a public servant We have two children at a private high school and one child at a Catholic primary school Will we be eligible for any of these family payments A Your husband will benefit from the changes to marginal tax brackets Without doing the calculations I would say about less tax in and about after that Unfortunately your tax payments will not be reduced In terms of eligibility for the FTB the means tested income threshold has increased You may be eligible for it but unfortunately it would not amount to much Q Maternity allowance I am pregnant with twins due in September To my way of understanding I should receive for each baby Is this payment means tested Also I thought I read that if I go back to work within the financial year and have been paid the Payment A and B when I was on maternity leave that I would not have to pay back that money if I have earned too much in the rest of the year when I return to work A Based on the information released you should receive for each baby and it is not means tested There is a lump sum for people eligible for FTB Part A in which will not apply if your children are born after June Family tax benefit remains and the means tested eligibility thresholds have increased If you go back to work you will not have to repay the FTB Part B Q Self funded retirees Apart from the minor health system tweaks what is there in the Budget for self funded retirees A Unfortunately self funded retirees do not directly benefit from the Budget Q Carers I am retired and I receive a fortnightly sum of with my pension this is to look after my wife Could you tell me the difference between carer payment and carer allowance A I suggest your best option is to contact Centrelink to clarify whether the amount you receive is the carer payment or carer allowance Q Super I see where the threshold for a low income individual to contribute to their own super fund has been lifted and the Government will contribute for each voluntarily contributed by the low income earner but did not see anything about if I contribute say to my wife s super fund What is the rebate for me My wife earns about a year and I earn Will the Government match what I put in and do I get a tax rebate on the contribution to my wife s super A The Budget does not provide much detail to answer your question but there is no indication that the rules regarding contributions to your spouse s fund have changed There is no indication that the Government will make a co contribution But if you earn you will receive a partial co contribution from the Government should you make any contributions to your own fund,"YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED

580,The rule of thumb for those whose pension schemes are put into the PPF is that over a lifetime the member s typical haircut is per cent Not so goldplated after all And there is nothing to stop the PPF further watering down benefits if it were to be hit by a rash of employer failures in future Corporate failures are of course relatively rare in any one year But over the or more years that the saving employee has to think about they are really quite common The Pension Lifetime Savings Association the trade association for those involved in designing operating advising on and investing in pensions has calculated that there are now three million people in Britain with only a chance of getting their full pensions Companies go bust It happens Which brings me to the concerning saga of the Barclays pension fund The bank is having to carve itself in two under the new ringfencing rules The core retail banking side of the bank is to be ringfenced with its own capital liquidity and board This is the part of the bank that is extremely unlikely to be allowed to fail in the event of future calamity Then there s the non ringfenced part of the bank the investment banking division and various foreign subsidiaries This part dubbed the casino bank would be left to go hang if it were to get into trouble There d be no taxpayer bailout That after all is one of the main purposes of ringfencing So guess which part of Barclays is being given responsibility for the staff pension fund one of the biggest private sector retirement organisations in the country with members most of them ordinary former branch and callcentre staff not hotshot screen jockeys who collectively are owed billion Unbelievably it s not the safe protected highly regulated part of the bank the part with a relatively reliable profit stream the bit it s easy to conceive still being around in years to honour those promises the one most of the pension members actually worked for No It s the casino Some Barclays staff and former staff are appalled Andrew Fox the former head of the bank s industrial economics unit who contributed to the scheme for years likens it to the BHS affair They re dumping the scheme he said It s very similar to BHS but without a pound coin changing hands I am totally at a loss as to why the trustees would agree to this Several other members contacted by The Times including senior bankers are also dismayed The casino bank will have to survive and prosper for at least another halfcentury to ensure that past promises are all honoured Who in their right mind could be confident of that after disasters such as Lehman Brothers Bear Stearns and Barings Bank Barclays and the trustees have obfuscated what is going on The trustees say in their annual communication to members that Barclays Bank plc will remain in place as the pension fund s principal employer This is disingenuous Yes it s literally correct but of course Barclays Bank plc is having the guts ripped out of it by the ringfence and is a far shakier guarantor than it was It gets worse The pension fund has a billion shortfall times bigger than Carillion s deficit for example On a worst case buyout basis the deficit is billion Yet bizarrely instead of insisting on lashings of immediate cash the trustees have given the bank more breathing space Previously agreed repair payments have actually been slashed In mitigation the trustees have secured the pledge of up to billion of assets from Barclays which in theory they would be able to seize if the bank were to default But even this looks a fudge If those assets really are pledged to the pension fund how come Barclays has not had to make any writedown or adjustment when calculating its capital ratios Who knows whether the trustees would really be able to enforce the claim amid the mayhem of a new financial crisis The High Court is due to examine the entire ringfencing project next month and those wishing to object now have ten days left to do so Because of a Barclays bungle and a glitch in the court s cumbersome online system this is proving nearimpossible Yesterday the bank recommended using snail mail Companies go bust And speculative beasts like Barclays casino division are more likely to go bust than most One of its main assets is part of the revived corpse of Lehman for goodness sake It it were to fail while there remained a deficit in the scheme it would make for a financial scandal ten times worse than Carillion Due process has been followed Boxes have been ticked Independent bodies have given their approval Yet it s hard to see how ordinary scheme members are not being let down by the bank by the trustees by Grant Thornton the accounting firm that wrote the skilled persons report approving the restructuring by the Bank of England and by the Pensions Regulator Their only hope now lies with the courts Patrick Hosking is Financial Editor of The Times,"""There's an unfortunate journalistic habit (I plead guilty) of describing traditional, defined-benefit pension promises as ""guaranteed"" or ""goldplated"". The Carillion collapse yesterday is an icy reminder that sometimes they are nothing of the sort. Almost 29,000 former and present workers probably won't get their full promised pensions.

The 16,000 of them who have not yet retired face an immediate reduction of 10 per cent in their promised pensions. All stand to be disadvantaged in the long run because of the reduced inflationproofing offered by the Pension Protection Fund.",1,

583,It is painful but it is reality We do have an obligation to protect the funded status Dalton said OPB s Learning With Less series has tracked the effects of budget cuts on schools over the last year Today Rob Manning takes a closer look at a key cause of rising costs teacher pensions More than Oregonians get pension payments from PERS Many are retired teachers like John and Cindy Hayden The Haydens live on a quiet cul de sac in Milwaukie with their two dogs after decades teaching in the Scappoose schools John Hayden says the pensions helped them travel to Europe and around the U S Hayden said So I look at our own situation here and all I can say is I don t dare complain about anything I didn t plan it I was just very fortunate Retirement benefits for folks like the Haydens are based primarily on two things how long you worked and what you earned when you left Cindy Hayden says she didn t consider retirement when she was working I mean how many people at or think about retirement You don t she said Cindy Hayden says teachers accepted retirement money to make up for pay raises that often failed to keep up with the rising cost of living She explained And then they come back and they yell at us We shouldn t have done that Well we had a contract At that time we would ve preferred to have had a raise in our salary But we accepted the other as a trade off knowing that it was years down the line perhaps Greg McPherson an employment attorney and a former Democratic state representative said Public pensions are appealing to public officials because they offer the opportunity to borrow McPherson said They can promise something that will have to be paid out over time and they don t have to raise the tax revenue to pay for those today That is an opportunity that is just too tempting to too many of our elected officials And as a result of what they ve done in the past we have a lot of liability we re going to have to pay off because we ve made commitments to our public workers That unfunded liability has grown from billion to billion according to this week s numbers Like many public retirement systems Oregon s PERS system depends on two funding sources investment earnings and contributions from government budgets JimGreen with the Oregon School Boards Association says decades back PERS was not that expensive Green said But when you start adding on things like money match and you allow the board to credit way more than what the earnings of the system should ve been and not put it into reserves then you created a mountain Money match was a system that had school districts and governments matching what employees invested and the market earnings they were getting And pension accounts guaranteed at least percent returns In the boom years in the s return rates hit percent Cindy Hayden said We ve been very fortunate we recognize that Cindy Hayden retired from teaching in when employees could retire on average at percent of their final salary She explained The year that I retired was one of the years where you had a higher percentage Legislators have taken a couple of stabs at reforming PERS The biggest changes affected new employees Workers hired starting in lost the percent guarantee Workers starting in moved into a system much more like a k plan But courts have ruled against attempts to change rules for people who were already in the system Greg McPherson led the reform in By PERS was virtually fully funded McPherson said The reforms would ve been sufficient to stabilize the PERS system over the long pull if the investment markets had remained strong But investment earnings dropped percent in At the same time tax income was down Since then markets and government budgets have been slow to recover workers have continued to retire and the system s unfunded liability has grown to billion There are three main hurdles to changing the system One is legal Beth Ann Darby with the Oregon Education Association the teachers union notes the state Supreme Court has rejected attempts to change rules for current workers and retirees Darby told OPB You know after the court spent a lot of time reaffirming that a promise is a promise and a contract is a contract And to just run new ideas that run afoul of that concept is just creating costly litigation for the state Another problem is political Greg McPherson s leadership on PERS cost him support from a powerful Democratic lobby public employee unions When McPherson ran for Attorney General a few years ago unions backed his opponent John Kroger McPherson is now running for mayor of Lake Oswego He said Several hundred thousand Oregonians have benefits coming to them under the PERS system and to make any changes to those even prospectively is a very heavy lift politically If the legal and political hurdles weren t enough PERS is also extremely complex and changes that seem straightforward simply aren t The OEA says the changes created a radical new plan and before trying anything more the union says the state should watch how the last changes play out But Jim Green with the school boards association worries that without changes to the system or more money retirement costs will cut into the classroom Green explained Classroom sizes will grow because we ve had to lay off teachers Other offerings that school districts have for students and for their parents aregoing to be reduced and we ll do less Some advocates worry that rising PERS costs could have another effect Lawmakers may be reluctant to shell out more for public schools if they suspect the money will go to pensions rather than classrooms Retired teachers Cindy and John Hayden hope legislators won t think that way Hayden said Only people who are going to be hurt are the kids Cindy added No not just the kids It s the kids the teachers it s all the support staff firefighters and their families police and their families It s everybody involved Nearly half of the million in higher PERS cost comes from the K system The bottom line for individual school districts will be clearer in late September when the PERS board receives more detailed information This story originally appeared on Oregon Public Broadcasting,"Oregon lawmakers learned this week they can budget for $80 million more than expected. But state budget costs are rising. At a meeting earlier this week, the Public Employee Retirement System announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher pension costs for the budget cycle, starting next July.

584,They won t let me in says the driver as we pull up at an anonymous looking steel gate alongside a security hut So I get out and as he speeds away I take a look around at the picturesque English countryside One hundred miles west of London and I am in the middle of nowhere Which is just how cellar master Laurie Greer likes it with precious bottles of wine dating back to discretion is paramount Welcome to Eastlays mine deep in Wiltshire First quarried in the th century it is now known as Corsham Cellars owned by Cert Octavian one of the U K s largest private wine storage facilities When the first tunnels were excavated much of the honey colored sandstone was used to build the Georgian town houses in the nearby towns of Bath and Corsham In the late s when war looked imminent the Ministry of Defence requisitioned it and transformed the place into a giant ammunition store replete with lighting whitewashed walls and concrete floors Since following its purchase by businessman Nigel Jagger its labyrinthine corridors have been stacked not with TNT but wine belonging to collectors such as composer Andrew Lloyd Webber financier Guy Hands and restaurateur Michel Roux Sr It s rather like an underground vault says Mr Greer who has overseen the mine since it was converted into a wine cellar He says it now contains wine belonging to more than wine merchants various wine investment funds restaurants as well as around private clients from as far afield as continental Europe the U S and the Far East The biggest change we have seen is that clients who own fine wine have become much more knowledgeable says Mr Greer They want to know where their wine has been stored what condition it is in even how it is looking For some the cases down below are their pride and joy It isn t unusual for private clients to pay a visit to Corsham Cellars where from above ground they can watch their cases of wine loaded onto the industrial goods train as it makes its way down one of the main shafts nine meters below ground into an area the size of football pitches In fact such is the attention to detail that the company has installed three photographic studios to meet the demand of clients wanting to see emailed photographs of their stored bottles of wine If this all sounds a little unnecessary then one has to understand the context Fine wine s remarkable bull run which has seen Bordeaux ch teaux wines such as Lafite Rothschild increase in price by more than sevenfold in the past seven years has focused collectors attention on storage Cases of wine that were once squirreled away in an old garden shed or below the stairs now have to be kept in optimum storage conditions if they are to retain their market value Most collectors know that wine stored in direct sunlight or in a room that is too hot can damage the liquid as can dramatic temperature swings An average temperature of between and degrees Celsius is preferable But with the value of wine soaring there is also the very real threat of security One of the great advantages of having an underground storage facility as opposed to an above ground warehouse says Mr Greer is that a thief can t just take a large vehicle and smash their way in Breaking into Corsham Cellars would require the sort of elaborate heist fictionalized in The Thomas Crown Affair Descending the steps I can see security is watertight For the record anyone looking to break in would have to negotiate the above ground CCTV cameras before dodging the movement detectors placed at the top of the mine Once past these two obstacles there is the small matter of starting up the goods train that transports the wine into the cellar either that or it s a steep climb down Once underground the thief would have to locate a fork lift and then find the rarest and most precious wine amid more than bottles By which time a separate alarm would have alerted the police Eastlays mine is one of a number of underground bunkers converted from former stone quarries that were used as massive ammunition depots in Wiltshire in World War II Mr Greer says the mine was also used as a set for the filming of the early episodes of Doctor Who Nearby is Burlington a hectare site that was converted to a subterranean Cold War City which could house up to government personnel in the event of a nuclear strike on the U K With the ending of the Cold War the site has since been decommissioned Back at Eastlays mine there is a reminder of World War II with some graffiti depicting the war leaders etched on the wall and various humorous rhymes and vignettes Wandering through the passages of this cavernous cellar one wonders what the many men who spent hours underground stacking ammunition while Europe was at war would have thought of the fact that years later it has become a giant depository of fine wine Judging by some of the graffiti scrawled on the walls they would have smiled Write to Will Lyons at wsje weekend wsj com,"It's a still, warm, late-summer day as the taxi driver weaves his way through a maze of narrow country lanes deep in England's rural landscape. Flanked either side by lush green hedgerows, the road veers to the right up a short drive beyond which acres of gently rolling, arable farmland stretch as far as the eye can see.

""I know the way,"" nods the driver in his soft West Country accent. ""My brother works here,"" he adds. ""They have plenty of bottles all right; some of them he tells me are worth up to Â£3,000."" He's not wrong. Lying 30 meters below us is the wine world's answer to Fort Knox, an enormous subterranean cavern holding more than Â£1 billion worth of fine wine. If you are storing your wine through a reputed U.K. merchant, then the chances are it is probably stacked here alongside the other 680,000 cases, in one of the largest underground storage facilities in Europe. No wonder security is tight.",0,

586,The crisis is compounding vulnerabilities among older people often entrenching these existing problems Our research reveals that up to of the newly un or underemployed are aged to This means nearly Australians aged to will have their hours impacted or lose their jobs due to the economic impact of COVID Mature age workers comprise an estimated of job losses and have been hit hard because many industries that are significant employers of these workers are among those most impacted by the recession education and training retail trade accommodation and food services Governments have acted quickly to put in place social protections for the whole population as well as some vulnerable groups but mature age low income people have fallen through the cracks The current policy response provides too few targeted supports that address their needs at the same time as their livelihoods are being threatened risking shunting this group between different forms of disadvantage and increasing reliance on inadequate social security payments There are a few reasons why this group misses out For starters some programs are primarily aimed at Australians aged such as enhancements to the Community Visitors Scheme Queensland s Care Army and an Older Persons Information Line Help for these people is welcome but Australians under also require targeted measures Then there is the short term focus on the relief effort which means longer term problems are not addressed and may even be exacerbated These policies include the temporary nature of the increased rate of unemployment benefit JobSeeker moratoriums on evictions and rent increases and funding boosts to ease pressure on support systems Early access to superannuation may cause later financial strain And there is the use of existing systems and service structures to deliver COVID programs when those structures are often flawed The challenges this group faces makes it particularly vulnerable to the social health and economic impacts of COVID and associated policy responses These issues are strongly intersectional in nature particularly regarding gender Women are more likely to take time out of work or to work part time while caring for children and or other family members As a result women are at disproportionally greater risk of housing and financial stress as they age Refugees and new migrants Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and anyone facing stigma or discrimination due to disability also experience these challenges in particularly significant and complex ways Take the experience of Mary a woman in her s Having spent time out of the workforce caring for her family Mary s employment prospects as a single mature age woman are limited to low paying jobs COVID has left Mary s job in doubt and without her regular income she cannot pay her rent Her lack of superannuation or other assets means she may rely on JobSeeker but if the rate is returned to the pre COVID level she will not be able to make ends meet There is action that governments can take to help low income mature aged Australians like Mary in the aftermath of COVID Our report makes recommendations relating to social security employment supports housing and care Address discrimination experienced by mature age workers through practical reforms including better targeting of education training and upskilling opportunities improving access to careers advice for mature age workers at risk of involuntary retirement or unemployment strengthening policies that promote workplace flexibility inclusive employment and retention practices including government demonstrating leadership through public service employment policies such as the Collaborative Partnership on Mature Age Employment Ensure mainstream employment services are adequately equipped to respond to the distinct needs of mature age workers Continue and expand targeted superannuation schemes to promote greater equity within the system and economic security in retirement Ensure social security benefits remain above subsistence levels Benchmark the liquid asset test for JobSeeker against median incomes Index Commonwealth Rent Assistance CRA payments to movements in national rents to provide immediate relief from housing stress and prevent erosion of the payment Improve security of tenure for renters including by ending no cause evictions and enabling reasonable home modifications to support people to age in their communities Facilitate greater collaboration between Commonwealth state and local governments to grow social housing through a sustained investment plan Expand funding for social financial and healthcare services available to mature age and older people facing housing insecurity and or homelessness as a result of COVID Introduce block funded community care coordination to identify mature age people at risk and help them navigate systems minimise crises facilitate housing security and maintain connections All these will take time so we have identified three short term actions government can provide financial support for utilities public transport medical services and supplies it can deliver targeted communications so mature age people can have clear information about how to get help and it can boost funding to financial counselling to support mature age low income workers to make good decisions Amid the disruption caused by COVID governments can make substantive changes to the way we support low income mature aged people before old policy habits and old policy problems return Mary

been a big increase in demand given the returns some investors and collectors have seen in the Banksy market Interest doesn t just come from the typical banker or hedge fund manager looking for a status symbol for their City flat Some of our largest clients are ordinary working people who have financed art portfolios through leveraging their property and remortgaging or taking advantage of cheap finance credit card deals for example he says But some street or urban artists work peaked in value around years ago Syer explains In there was a big rush of money into this market culminating in Bonhams Urban Art auction shortly before the banking collapse Many artists set records which are unlikely to be broken for some years However the artists or markets that recovered such as Banksy have really prospered We would now class his work as blue chip as it is being sold globally alongside Andy Warhol Roy Lichtenstein and Keith Haring Investors he says should look at the secondary market for an artwork with a positive track record perhaps it has been auctioned a few times and increased in value Edition prints are a great way of getting into markets where original works are out of reach and with online trading platforms it is very easy to buy and sell Banksy s Girl with Balloon is a great example A signed print was originally sold for in around and has just auctioned for For those with smaller amounts to invest Syer suggests looking at work by Irish street artist Conor Harrington or an unsigned Banksy print Be vigilant about fakes and get verification Scams and frauds are common In the case of Banksy Pest Control is an authentication service set up by the artist in that can verify works for a fee Buyers should also be aware of dealer or auction fees Peter Gagliardi head of Gagliardi Gallery in Chelsea London which sells original contemporary art says even if an artwork rises in value owners will lose to in fees when it is sold If you view your artwork as an investment then factor in the commissions and fees he says How much has the work got to increase in value before you have covered any fee when you come to sell Gagliardi warns buyers that they need to be prepared for ups and downs in the market an artist who is popular today may not necessarily stand the test of time He adds Damien Hirst was fashionable in the contemporary art market a few years ago There was a big media push But I would say that has peaked now and prices have been falling All the more reason to buy art you love then it should not matter if it rises or falls in value The return is in the pleasure it brings Ian Hay is passionate about contemporary art so much so he left his job as a pension administrator to set up the Saul Hay Gallery in Manchester with his wife Catherine to champion modern artists He is especially proud of his personal collection in particular an oil self portrait by Canadian artist Andrew Salgado pictured which he bought for in at the London Art Fair Salgado has become widely acclaimed and his larger paintings can sell for tens of thousands of pounds I d been following Salgado s work for a while when I saw this piece The Paradox I liked it immediately Its loose expressionism style appeals to me says Hay who is pleased to have spotted a young artist before he became a global success I couldn t afford an original Salgado now I suppose that s a sign I made a good investment But to my mind the real return is in the pleasure a piece of art brings to you and I just love this painting,"With a Banksy selling for close on Â£10m, is there now a knock-on effect for investors?

It is the artwork for our times. A four-metre-wide Banksy depicting MPs in the House of Commons as chimpanzees set a record for the artist when it sold for close to Â£10m at Sothebyâ€™s in London after just 13 minutes of bidding.",0,

be able to claim your money back through your credit or debit card provider Credit card payments between and are covered under Section of the Consumer Rights Act To start a claim you need to contact your credit card provider directly Which has a free tool that can help you do this Get insurance Last year many insurance firms changed the small print of their travel policies to exclude coronavirus related issues But many have adapted their policies to include Covid woes including cancellations and illness related costs However what you re covered for depends on the policy usually the more you pay the more you re covered for Most insurers will now cover your medical costs if you contract the virus while on holiday but only a few will payout for cancellations The majority will not cover you if you travel against Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office FCDO advice Only one in will cover you if a positive or missed Covid tests prevents you from boarding a flight reports the BBC so it s
