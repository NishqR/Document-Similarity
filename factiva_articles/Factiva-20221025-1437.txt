New Delhi, April 3 -- ING U.S. Investment Management (ING U.S. IM) announced that effective in March it became program manager for the advisor-sold portion of the state of Iowa's IAdvisor 529 Plan. In this role, the firm handles all investment, product, marketing, sales and distribution, customer service and recordkeeping for the program. ING U.S. IM assumed a similar role for the $1.3 billion Wisconsin Advisor-Sold Program, Tomorrow's Scholar, in November 2012.

"We are extremely pleased to have been selected to manage the IAdvisor 529 Plan," said Mark Spina , head of Intermediary Distribution at ING U.S. IM. "This strategic win builds on our momentum in the advisor-sold 529 marketplace, which commenced when we were named program manager of the advisor-sold Wisconsin Tomorrow's Scholar 529 Program last November. We believe that, given our expertise managing retirement assets, we are well suited to serve the needs for college savings, which surveys indicate is the biggest concern of investors. Our mission is to help advisors and their clients meet their investment objectives with confidence."

Spina added that effective support and education is important for financial advisors seeking to initiate and build 529 client relationships. To that end, ING U.S. IM's 529 website showcases the customized tools that empower advisors to better assist clients and prospects in understanding and embracing 529 plans as effective vehicles for college savings.

"We want to make it easier for advisors to utilize 529 solutions with their client base," added Spina. "We believe there is significant opportunity for advisors to introduce college savings programs in the years ahead. 529s have not yet been tapped by a significant portion of the population, and we believe the combination of more favorable demographics, rising college costs and the plan's intrinsic tax and estate planning advantages will make it increasingly important for advisors to guide investors to utilize 529s for this significant long-term investment objective."

ING U.S. IM's 529 investment programs are built on efficiency and flexibility. Advisors can choose from age-based funds, static allocation options, and a diversified mix of individual funds. Advisors can also customize solutions based on individual circumstances. The underlying funds are managed by the firm as well as by other leading asset managers. All of the 529 portfolio options are overseen by ING U.S. IM's Multi Asset Strategies and Solutions (MASS) team, a leader in multi-manager, multi-asset investment strategies.

"529 plans are such an effective vehicle to help parents pay for their children's higher education because of their tax advantages, including tax-exempt growth of any earnings," said John Uricchio , senior vice president of Distribution at ING U.S. IM. "Our 529 programs include a wide range of investment choices from multiple managers, age and risk-based options, and modified share classes to make it easier for advisors to match their compensation choices to investor needs."

We need to provide Canadians with further choice - choice that gives them date certainty and real dollar amount certainty

Canadians should be allowed to contribute more to the Canadian Pension Plan to "reignite a culture of savings," CIBC president and CEO Gerry McCaughey said Wednesday in a speech.

"I believe the time has come to give Canadians the opportunity to enhance their pension savings by making additional, voluntary contributions to the Canada Pension Plan - or a CPP-like vehicle," Mr. McCaughey told an audience of senior government and business leaders at the National Summit on Pension Reform in Fredericton, NB.

How to reshape your retirement plans in an era of volatile markets

Retirement savings challenge young people

Today, for many Canadians, there's a bigger emphasis placed on investing - on rates of return - than on the critical need to actually set aside money

According to new research conducted by CIBC, almost 6 million Canadians will face a drop in living standards of more than 20% if current savings rate trends continue. "When we look at those 5.8 million people - we see that most of them are young. In fact, our economists estimate that almost 60% of adults in their late 20s or early 30s, can expect to experience a significant decline in their standard of living when they retire," he said.

"A generation ago, a person starting out in the world focused first on earning money. Then, as they found their way in the workplace and their earnings grew, they began to think about saving," he said. "Today, for many Canadians, there's a bigger emphasis placed on investing - on rates of return - than on the critical need to actually set aside money."

A 35-year-old person today puts aside, on average, less than half of what a 35-year-old saved a generation ago, he added. With company pensions becoming increasingly rare, Canadians must refocus on savings.

Under CPP currently, employers and employees each pay annual premiums of 4.95% on the amount of their pensionable earnings between $3,500 and $51,100, the upper threshold having been increased by $1,000 this year, for a maximum premium of $2,356.20 each. Self-employed people pay the combined premiums, $4,712.40. Maximum benefits for 2013 are $12,150 annually from CPP, adjusted each year for inflation, and $546.07 monthly from Old Age Security, adjusted quarterly.

"I believe that a reasonable starting point, benefitting the greatest number of individuals, would be to allow Canadians to increase their contributions to the CPP," he said. "We need to provide Canadians with further choice - choice that gives them date certainty and real dollar amount certainty. A choice that will help Canadians as individuals, and Canada as a nation, reignite a culture of savings."

What's new News Corporation's second-quarter results comfortably exceeded market expectations, with normalised net income up 5 per cent and earnings per share (EPS) jumping 13 per cent.

The powerhouse cable network division posted another stellar performance, rising 7 per cent off an already impressive base to $US945 million ($914 million). It now accounts for more than 60 per cent of the group's earnings.

The much-maligned free-to-air television division also registered strong growth, up 19 per cent in the quarter to $US224 million.

On the negative side, the Italian satellite pay TV broadcaster, Sky Italia, turned in a loss of $US20 million (versus a $US6 million profit a year ago), as it lost 28,000 subscribers and ramped up programming investments to stem the tide.

Filmed entertainment saw earnings decline 3 per cent to $US383 million.

Outlook The solid quarterly result was partly overshadowed by a cut to News Corporation's operating earnings growth guidance for the full year, from "high single to low double digit" to a "mid-to-high single digit" percentage gain.

While disappointing, the magnitude of the downgrade was not material.

Furthermore, one of the main causes of the downgrade was the structural problems afflicting its Australian newspaper assets - no longer a surprise to anyone.

What we are focused on, and remain attracted to, is News Corporation's diverse portfolio of leading electronic media content assets, most of which demonstrate either very strong growth outlook (the cable-network division) or remarkable resilience (film, free-to-air TV).

Importantly, there are plenty of catalysts for the market to reappraise the underlying value of these assets, as the proposed split of the print businesses into a separately listed vehicle remains on track for mid-2013.

Price While the stock price slumped 4 per cent on the results day, due to market disappointment over the cut in earnings guidance, it has more than recovered since then. Over the past six months, the stock has surged 23 per cent; for 12 months it is up 53 per cent - easily outperforming the overall market.

Worth buying? The downgrade in News Corporation's earnings guidance for the full year was disappointing. However, its magnitude was immaterial and its importance pales in comparison with the continuing strong growth of the cable network division and the remarkable resilience of the film and free-to-air TV assets.

The company's balance sheet remains robust (gearing of only 30 per cent and an interest cover of six times), notwithstanding $US6 billion in stock repurchases over the past eight months, with another $US4 billion left in the buy-back program.

While the stock is trading at more than 16 times fiscal 2013 consensus EPS estimates, this quickly drops to less than 14 times the following year, due to the strong earnings growth outlook. Consequently, we believe the stock is worth buying at current levels.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Death, taxes and investment returns; Markets insight

Benjamin Franklin always accepted that the US constitution might change; "The only things we can be certain of are death and taxes," he wrote to French scientist Jean-Baptiste Leroy. If Leroy had known about the planned new top tax rate of 75 per cent in France he'd surely have agreed.

Death is not really relevant to investors; you can't take it with you, after all. But taxes are vital - and along with other investment costs, they are often ignored by those looking back at past returns.

This makes some charts from Stanhope Capital, which runs money for wealthy families and charities, particularly handy. Jonathan Bell at Stanhope looked back at past tax rates in the UK and calculated the returns needed merely to beat inflation, for a top-rate taxpayer.

First, the tax rates. For those in the UK complaining about the current 45 per cent top rate, which kicks in at £150,000, just be grateful you didn't live in the 1960s: the top rate of tax on investment income was about 90 per cent until Margaret Thatcher slashed it in 1979.

In 1967 it hit an eye-watering 136 per cent, because of a one-off extra charge of 45 per cent, on top of income tax and the investment income surcharge.

The FTSE All-Share index had a great year in 1967, rising 29 per cent. But the dividend yield of 5.8 per cent at the start of that year can't have been much use to anyone, given the prevailing income tax level. Luckily, capital gains tax was lower, having only been introduced in 1965 at 30 per cent, so investors could still make money from rising share prices. But today investors have been rushing to buy dividend-paying shares, as their search for income forces them to take more risk and buy "bond proxies", companies with strong balance sheets which look likely to keep paying (and raising) their dividends without a problem.

The chart (left) shows the pre-tax return needed from income just to keep up with inflation.

The gap at the end of the 1950s is because prices were falling. Note that the chart only goes up to the end of 2011; with the latest reading of retail prices up 3.1 per cent year-on-year, top-rate taxpayers would need income of 5.6 per cent to maintain the value of their investments, or capital gains of 4.3 per cent.

Given last year's stellar returns from equities, shareholders did rather well, for a change.

Terry Smith is of course quite right to say that the tax tail should never wag the investment dog. But this chart helps explain why it often does, and why tax planning tends to take priority over sensible investment structures for so many financial advisers.

Portman Asks Treasury Secretary Nominee Jacob Lew Tough Questions Regarding Mahoning Valley Delphi Salaried Retirees Stripped of Pensions - Decreased retiree income and benefits will cost the Youngstown area about $58 million per year in lost economic activity

Office of Sen. Rob Portman (R-OH) News Release

Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio), former director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), submitted questions for the Congressional Record for the Senate Finance Committee hearing considering the nomination of Jacob Lew to serve as Treasury Secretary regarding the treatment of retired Delphi salaried workers during the General Motors bankruptcy. The Administration has yet to sufficiently address and remedy the treatment of workers who lost a significant portion of their pension benefits, while other retirees from the same company received far better treatment.

"During a time of high unemployment and weak economic growth, hundreds of Mahoning Valley families are still scratching their heads in disbelief and disappointment, wondering why they did not receive the benefits promised to help them care for their families after years of hard work," said Portman. "I am concerned by the lack of transparency throughout this process, and will continue to push the Administration to answer tough questions regarding the unfair treatment of Delphi retirees."

When Delphi's defined benefit pension plan was terminated, Delphi workers lost an estimated 30 to 70 percent in benefits. The Auto Policy Task Force subsequently decided to "top-up" the pension benefits of certain retirees, not the 20,000 salaried retirees, including 1,500 salaried retirees in the Mahoning Valley. This has had a severe economic impact on thousands of retired Delphi salaried employees in Ohio. An economic impact study by Youngstown State University found that decreased retiree income and benefits will cost the Youngstown area about $58 million per year in lost economic activity.

Portman submitted the three questions below for the Congressional Record:

(1) As General Motors Company's primary lender in bankruptcy, the Treasury Department played a substantial role in GM's 2009 bankruptcy and subsequent resolution of Delphi pensions. This involvement culminated in GM's decision to fund portions of hourly but not salaried Delphi pensions. Did the Treasury Department receive any communication, direction, or other influence from the White House on Delphi pensions?

(2) Did any official at the Treasury Department communicate with GM in any way to influence the company toward supporting Delphi hourly pensions, or against supporting salaried pensions?

(3) On August 13, 2012, House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp requested that the Treasury Department provide "All records... that relate to: Delphi; and/or GM's interest in Delphi." To date, the Treasury Department has only provided a selection of documents and has refused to certify that it has or will comply completely with the request. Does the Treasury Department plan to comply with the Ways and Means Committee's request?

Supreme Court Of Canada Releases Decision in Indalex

Mondaq Business Briefing

This morning, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) released its decision in Sun Indalex Finance, LLC v. United Steelworkers (Indalex). A majority of the SCC made the following rulings, which have wide-ranging ramifications for lenders, employers and pension plan administrators of Ontario-registered defined benefit pension plans:

The SCC upheld the finding of the Ontario Court of Appeal (ONCA) that the deemed trust imposed under subsection 57(4) of the Ontario Pension Benefits Act (PBA) applies only to a pension plan that is terminated, but, when it applies, extends to the entirety of a defined benefit plan's "wind up deficiency." This finding may have significant ramifications for lenders relying on security interests in accounts and/or inventory, since, under the Ontario Personal Property Security Act, these interests are expressly made subordinate to "deemed trusts" under the PBA.

The SCC overturned the ONCA in finding that the deemed trust did not have priority over the claim of the debtor in possession (DIP) lender in this case. The Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) judge had made an order granting the DIP loan "super-priority" over any statutory trusts, including those arising under the PBA. The SCC overturned the ONCA and held that the doctrine of federal paramountcy means that the court-ordered DIP priority supersedes claims under the PBA's deemed trust provision, without need to have paramountcy asserted in the relevant court order.

The SCC's decision is consistent with the ONCA's finding that the directors of Indalex Limited failed to properly manage a conflict of interest between their fiduciary duties to the corporation on the one hand and, in their role as plan administrator, to the pension plan beneficiaries on the other, when they proceeded to seek a court order granting priority to the DIP loan without sufficient notice to the beneficiaries.

Although the SCC found that the directors of Indalex had acted in a conflict of interest vis-à-vis plan beneficiaries, a majority of the judges overturned the ONCA's award of a constructive trust over the assets of the estate in favour of beneficiaries of Indalex's executive pension plan (to which the PBA's deemed trust provision did not apply).

For a fuller discussion of the ONCA's previous decision, please see our e-Alerts of   December 1, 2011, June 2, 2011, April 21, 2011 and April 8, 2011 as well as Volume 5, Issue 1 of our Litigation Co-Counsel newsletter, available here.

What's building over the border? Optimism

The stop-and-start recovery has left many investors wary of good news. However, the rebound in the U.S. housing market looks to be not only real, but a potential turning point in the country's slow climb back to normality.

James Marple of TD Economics says in a report published this week that the real estate rebound that gained speed in 2012 "was likely just the beginning of a multi-year rise in the U.S. housing market."

If this proves true, it's welcome news for Canadians, since our exporters stand to gain a great deal from our biggest trading partner's growing appetite for homes.

Why should we be optimistic? U.S. housing starts in December were up 37 per cent over the same period a year earlier, according to the Census Bureau, while analytics service CoreLogic estimated home prices rose 8.3 per cent in the same period.

The annualized pace of 954,000 housing starts in December, 2012, is nearly double the level in April, 2009, when starts were plugging along at a 478,000-units-a-year clip. At first glance, the surge may seem like a unrealistically large uptick - but if you compare it to historical levels, which once passed 2 million units a year, it's clear there's still plenty of room to rise.

Relative to the history of housing starts, the U.S. has "barely surpassed the trough of previous cycles," Mr. Marple wrote.

Further gains will be fuelled by a brightening economic picture. The recession knocked the wind out of the labour market, making it more difficult for people - especially young people - to form new households. As employment numbers have rebounded, the number of households headed by people between 24 and 34 has also grown, Mr. Marple wrote.

That sets up the country for growth of 1.3 million new households each year. The new households should generate plenty of demand for new homes, especially given how cheap home prices have become. The 32-per-cent price drop after the housing bubble's late-2005 peak brought home prices from historic highs of nearly four times the U.S. median annual income to 2.6 times that value in 2012.

This is "exactly in line with its long-run average," Mr. Marple wrote, and makes homes as affordable as they were between 1979 and 1999. Which makes a pretty good case for optimism.

As always, there will be headwinds, including historically high foreclosure rates and rising student debt among new graduates, the economist wrote.

But considering the pace of household formation in the U.S., Mr. Marple wrote, new-housing activity is still as much as 30 per cent behind where it could be. That could be up to 40 per cent if you take into account the need to replace decaying housing stock. Anyone need some Canadian lumber?

Charles Schwab announced the launch of a new Planning Center on Schwab.com with content and insights to help investors begin planning for retirement, estate planning, college savings and more.

According to a release, for each of these topics, the planning process is broken into manageable steps based on an individual's specific situation and goals, and the Planning Center delivers straightforward strategies and actionable next steps to help investors get started and maintain momentum.

In a survey of more than 1,000 Schwab clients conducted in mid-December 2012, 42 percent said now is a good time to invest, and 62 percent indicated that they would be likely to invest a $25,000 windfall, but 34 percent said they are confident in their own investment decision making.

"Our clients are becoming increasingly engaged in investing and planning, and our new Planning Center offers practical guidance on how to plan for a variety of financial goals and life-events, which can give them more confidence that they are on the right path," said Rodney Prezeau, Charles Schwab Senior Vice President of Client Experience.

Schwab's new Planning Center dives into an array of important topics and reflects the breadth and depth of financial guidance Schwab can provide to investors, including

-Retirement

-Estate planning

-College savings

-Planning for significant life events

-Debt management

-Insurance

-Saving strategies

Schwab's new Planning Center is available at schwab.com/planning and is available to both clients and non-clients.

"We created the Planning Center as a resource for people who want to start the planning process and need to better understand the key considerations for different financial goals," noted Prezeau. "From there, Schwab offers a wide range of resources to help them achieve their goals."

Schwab's Expanding Planning and Advice Offers

Schwab's Planning Center is the latest addition to Schwab's suite of planning and advice resources for investors that includes tools, research, one-on-one guidance, and portfolio solutions.

Illustrating Schwab's focus on providing more planning and investing guidance, in 2012, Schwab hosted more than 600,000 in-person client meetings, delivered more than 20,000 complimentary consultations, and presented 56,500 personalized financial and investing plans. Assets in Schwab's advice programs stood at more than $120 billion at the end of 2012.

"Seventy-six percent of clients we recently surveyed said that even periodic advice from a professional would give them more confidence in achieving their financial goals," said Prezeau. "Schwab has evolved well past its roots as a discount broker to offer sophisticated investment advice and planning that can help investors navigate today's markets and economy."

The Charles Schwab Corp. is a provider of financial services, with more than 300 offices and 8.8 million active brokerage accounts, 1.6 million corporate retirement plan participants, 865,000 banking accounts.

Family of IRA man illegally shot by Paras slams failure to quiz police witnesses

THE family of an IRA man shot by soldiers 40 years ago says the failure of police to identify two Special Branch officers who witnessed the killing is "shameful".

Aine McCann questioned how the officers had never been identified after a new report found that soldiers who shot her father were unjustified in opening fire.

Joe McCann, a member of the Official IRA, was hit several times when challenged near his home in the Markets area of south Belfast in 1972.

The Historical Enquiries Team (HET) accused police of failing to properly investigate the "unlawful" killing of the married fatherof-four.

The review team''s report said: "The HET considers that Joe''s actions did not amount to the level of specific threat which could have justified the soldiers opening fire in accordance with the Army Rules of Engagement or their standard operating procedures."

Mr McCann, one of the Official IRA's leading activists, was shot on April 15, 1972, in Joy Street.

Two RUC Special Branch officers recognised a disguised Mc-Cann and decided to arrest him, asking nearby soldiers for help, but McCann ran off.

Evidence from police and soldiers was that they shouted at him to stop or they would open fire. After he failed to halt, three paratroopers opened fire and he was hit by two or three bullets.

Two of the soldiers were interviewed under caution in London. The third did not cooperate.

The HET said McCann was unarmed and there was no evidence he was doing anything other than trying to escape.

The report also said the review team was unable to question the officers present that day.

Aine said that the failure of the PSNI to reveal the identity of the police officers involved on the day was "shameful".

"It has not been possible to question the Special Branch version of events because, incredibly, the RUC then and the PSNI now, claim not to be aware of the identities of the two Special Branch officers that were following Joe that day," she said.

The HET discovered a document in the archives of the First Battalion of the Parachute Regiment - the first time its existence has emerged - which prohibited shooting when someone ran away when challenged or did not halt, but was not endangering anybody's life or a place under guard. Anne McCann said he could have been arrested alive.

Tackling extremist violence is one of the priorities of the Group of Eight leading nations following the attack on a gas facility in Algeria in which scores of people were killed, including several Britons, U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron said Thursday.

As western allies put pressure on al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, networks affiliated with the terrorist group have grown in Yemen, Somalia and parts of North Africa--places that have suffered through "hostage-taking, terrorism and crime," he said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

"I'll put my cards on the table. I believe we are in the midst of a long struggle against murderous terrorists and the poisonous ideology that supports them," he said. "To defeat this menace, we've got to be tough, intelligent and patient--and this is the argument I'll be making at the G-8."

There will be a place for military action where necessary, he said, adding that the French were right to act in Mali and he supported their intervention.

Efforts to tackle the narrative of extremist groups should involve diplomacy, aid budgets, political relations and military and security cooperation, he said.

"The G-8 can discuss how we can best divide up some of the work between us--and how we can partner up with the countries worst affected to overcome this threat and like I say, this will be right up there on our agenda," he said.

Mr. Cameron also reiterated that under the U.K.'s yearlong presidency of the G-8 in 2013, the group would also focus on advancing free trade, ensuring tax compliance and promoting greater transparency.

The prime minister also reiterated his case for his plan--should he win the next general election scheduled in 2015--to renegotiate the U.K.'s relationship with the European Union and then hold a national referendum on whether to remain members of the bloc by the end of 2017.

Asked about whether this plan would put businesses off investing in Britain, he said there was already a debate under way about Britain's place in Europe and it was better to try and lead the debate on the issue.

"It is much better to be frank and open about that and set out the pathway where we are going to resolve this issue in a way that will actually benefit business because we will end up with a more competitive, more open European Union ," he said. "Yes, all courses of action on this issue have their difficulties, but I would argue the riskiest thing of all would be to do nothing."

Are Old iPhones a Gateway Drug?

Rather than plunk down $200 for an iPhone 5, many smartphone buyers are going with the older iPhone 4, which is available for free with a two-year contract. This trend toward the cheaper devices may concern investors, but in the long run, there's some evidence it could actually be good for Apple (AAPL).

Discussing Apple's earnings Wednesday, CEO Tim Cook said that iPhone 4 sales "remained strong." The iPhone 4 costs $450 without a two-year contract, compared to $650 for the iPhone 5, which is both faster and has a larger screen. On Tuesday, Verizon Wireless said the newer model accounted for less than half of the 6.2 million iPhones the company activated last quarter. "The shift toward older phones may weigh on average selling prices," says Brian Colello, analyst at Morningstar.

But here's the possible silver lining: There's a good chance most of those people buying older iPhones will eventually upgrade to a new one, analysts say. Most buyers already own an iPhone. In fact, the company has one of the highest upgrade rates in the industry. Some 83% of iPhone owners in December 2012 said they would upgrade to another iPhone--up from 73% a year ago, according to a survey last month by Morgan Stanley Research. That retention rate was 63% for Samsung and just 47% for HTC.

The older phones are in effect gateway gadgets: Most customers who buy the older iPhones have never owned an Apple product before, experts say, and after getting a taste, many are likely to want more. It's a way of reeling in new customers and putting them on the two-year upgrade cycle, analysts say. Nearly 20% of iPhone sales in the final quarter of last year were people switching from Android, up from 9% for the same period in 2011, according to a new report by consumer research group Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.

To be sure, Apple is heavily dependent on the iconic gadget, and investors remain concerned about softening sales growth. The iPhone accounts for around 56% of its revenue--one reason the company's share price has fallen from its high of over $700 last September. The iPhone sold 47.8 million units in the first fiscal quarter, the highest quarterly iPhone sales figure and up 29% from the year-earlier period. However, the company forecasts total revenue rising just 7% in the current quarter.

But the strong resale market for iPhones suggests that Apple will continue to benefit from the two-year upgrade cycle. Ahead of a new iPhone release, the older devices still sell for as much as $300 on resale sites, meaning consumers who own an iPhone can effectively upgrade to the new model for free--and may even earn a profit, says Yung Trang, president of TechBargains.com.

£75,000 care cap is 'mean and cynical'

CAMPAIGNERS HAVE attacked plans by the Government to introduce a £75,000 cap on long-term care costs as "too high, mean and cynical".

The National Pensioners Convention (NPC) said that only a "tiny" number of people would benefit from a cap set at such a level.

In the next few days ministers are poised to unveil a first limit on how much an individual will have to pay for care fees before the state steps in.

However, the proposed £75,000 limit is significantly higher than many experts had expected.

A government report by the economist Andrew Dilnot suggested a limit as low as £25,000, but the study also said a cap of £60,000 could be viable. The limit would not apply to accommodation costs.

"Such a cap would be too high and would be a mean and cynical move. Only a very small number of people have care costs that reach that level," said Neil Duncan-Jordan, the NPC's national officer.

"Any claim by the Government that they had sorted out long-term care would ring hollow. The two big problems with the system are the quality of care and the fact that many people are losing their homes to fund care. This cap won't address these issues."

At the moment anyone with assets worth more than £23,250 - including their home - has to pay for their own care. The average cost of such care is £700 a week. Currently about 40,000 people a year are obliged to sell their homes to cover the cost of care.

Ros Altmann, the directorgeneral of Saga, has called on the Government to raise the £23,250 asset threshold. She also believes that a £75,000 care cost cap is too small to protect many people from having to sell their homes.

Ministers ruled out a cap as low as £35,000 as it would cost taxpayers as much as £2billion a year. A limit of £75,000 would cost £700million.

Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, said the Government had "fallen far short" of a fair solution to the care crisis. "A cap on care bills of £75,000 per person, or £150,000 per couple, will not protect the home and life savings of an average family," he said. "Andrew Dilnot's proposed cap of £35,000 would be a significant step towards helping older people protect what they've worked for.

"Labour remains open to cross-party talks on funding the Dilnot plan and are disappointed the Government has decided to go it alone with this half-baked alternative."

Stephen Dorrell, a former Tory health secretary who chairs the Commons health committee, said it was an "important step". "Clearly £75,000 is at the high end, but introducing a limit is a good step along the path of sorting out long-term care," he said.

Public Health; Recent Studies from Research Unit for General Practice Add New Data to Public Health

2013 JAN 18 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Health & Medicine Week -- Investigators publish new report on Public Health. According to news originating from Bergen, Norway, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, "Women's higher risk of disability pension compared with men is found in countries with high female work participation and universal welfare schemes. The aim of the study was to examine the extent to which self-perceived health, family situation and work factors explain women's higher risk of disability pension."

Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Research Unit for General Practice, "We also explored how these factors influenced the gender difference across educational strata. The population-based Hordaland Health Study (HUSK) was conducted in 1997-99 and included inhabitants born in 1953-57 in Hordaland County, Norway. The current study included 5,959 men and 6,306 women in paid work with valid information on education and self-perceived health. Follow-up data on disability pension, for a period of 5-7 years, was obtained by linking the health survey to a national registry of disability pension. Cox regression analyses were employed. During the follow-up period 99 (1.7%) men and 230 (3.6%) women were awarded disability pension, giving a twofold risk of disability pension for women compared with men. Except for a moderate impact of self-perceived health, adjustment for family situation and work factors did not influence the gender difference in risk. Repeating the analyses in strata of education, the gender difference in risk of disability pension among the highly educated was fully explained by self-perceived health and work factors. In the lower strata of education there remained a substantial unexplained gender difference in risk. In a Norwegian cohort of middle-aged men and women, self-perceived health, family situation and work factors could not explain women's higher likelihood of disability pension. However, analyses stratified by educational level indicate that mechanisms behind the gender gap in disability pension differ by educational levels."

According to the news editors, the research concluded: "Recognizing the heterogeneity within gender may contribute to a deeper understanding of women's higher risk of disability pension."

Area's home loan defaults down 26% in 2012

Detroit News Finance Editor

The tsunami of foreclosures that has ebbed and flowed through the American economy since the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007 continued today with the news of another crackdown on foreclosure abuses even as the total of homes lost to default declined during 2012.

Metro Detroit had its second consecutive double-digit decline in foreclosure activity last year with a nearly 26 percent drop, according to RealtyTrac, an Irvine, Calif., foreclosure tracking company.

The Detroit region's year-end total of 39,039 foreclosure filings was its lowest since 2006, when the foreclosure crisis began to swell. Most other areas of the country are experiencing foreclosure activity closer to 2007 and 2008 levels, according to RealtyTrac.

Foreclosures peaked in 2010, both nationally and in Michigan, and have declined every year since then. The decline contributed to last year's 6.2 percent growth in Metro Detroit home sales.

Meanwhile, the Consumer Finance Protection Board in Washington, D.C., announced new rules for mortgage servicers that offer new protections to borrowers struggling to keep their homes.

"For many borrowers, dealing with mortgage servicers has meant unwelcome surprises and constantly getting the runaround," Bureau Director Richard Cordray said in a statement. "In too many cases, it has led to unnecessary foreclosures. Our rules ensure fair treatment for all borrowers."

Mortgage servicers aren't the investors who own the loans, but are third-party companies that deal with borrowers, collecting payments, and handling tax and insurance escrow accounts.

Servicers have been the subject of several new enforcement actions. Last week, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced an $8.5 billion settlement over 3.8 million mishandled foreclosures by 10 major servicers.

A related review of 4.4 million foreclosures had started in 2011, but had become bogged down without a single dollar being paid out to homeowners.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced that Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will pay a combined $557million to settle federal complaints that they wrongfully foreclosed on homeowners who should have been allowed to stay in their homes.

Finally, Friday is the deadline for another group of mortgage borrowers hit by faulty foreclosures to file their claims under the $25 billion national "robo-signing" settlement with five major loan servicers - including Detroit's Ally Bank - and 49 states.

Claims can be filed online at www.nationalmortgagesettlement.com.

Borrowers also can contact the settlement administrator, toll-free at (866) 430-8358 or email administrator@nationalmortgagesettlement.com.

The new rules are too little too late for a Metro Detroit attorney who defends homeowners.

"You've got thousands of homeowners who have already suffered from just the activities these rules are seeking to address," said consumer protection attorney Brian P. Parker of Bingham Farms.

"What about all the millions of people who have already suffered these problems?"

U.S. mortgage settlement: Goldman, Morgan Stanley to pay $557M to settle foreclosure-abuse case

WASHINGTON - Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley will pay a combined $557 million to settle U.S. federal complaints that they wrongfully foreclosed on homeowners who should have been allowed to stay in their homes.

The agreements announced Wednesday with the Federal Reserve were similar to deals struck earlier this month with 10 other major banks and mortgage lenders. Combined, the 12 firms will pay more than $9 billion.

The settlements could compensate hundreds of thousands of Americans whose homes were seized because of abuses such as "robo-signing," when banks automatically signed off on foreclosures without properly reviewing documents. The agreement will also help eliminate huge potential liabilities for the banks.

Consumer advocates say regulators settled for too low a price by letting banks avoid full responsibility for foreclosures that victimized families.

Under the settlement, Goldman and Morgan Stanley will pay $232 million in cash compensation to homeowners to end an independent review of loan files required under a 2011 action by the Fed and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The remaining $325 million will be used to reduce mortgage balances and to forgive outstanding principal on home sales that generated less than borrowers owed on their mortgages.

About 220,000 people whose homes were in foreclosure in 2009 and 2010 are eligible for payments under the deal with the two banks, the Fed said. The payments could range from hundreds of dollars up to $125,000, depending on the type of possible error.

The structure of the deal is nearly identical to the $8.5-billion settlement announced last week with Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, MetLife Bank, PNC Financial Services, Sovereign, SunTrust, U.S. Bank and Aurora.

Those banks will pay about $3.3 billion to 3.8 million homeowners to end the review of foreclosures. The rest - $5.2 billion - will go toward mortgage modifications and principal forgiveness.

Two other banks were subject to the 2011 independent reviews. HSBC and Ally Financial have been in discussions with regulators on similar settlements but have yet to reach deals.

Banks and consumer advocates had complained that the loan-by-loan reviews required under the 2011 order were time-consuming and costly and didn't reach many homeowners. Banks were paying large amounts to consultants to review the files. Some questioned the independence of those consultants, who often ruled against homeowners.

The settlements don't close the book on the housing crisis, which brought more than 4 million foreclosures. They cover only borrowers who were in foreclosure in 2009 and 2010. And resolving millions of claims involving multiple banks and mortgage companies is complicated and time-consuming.

The deals announced this month are separate from a $25-billion settlement struck last February with five major banks by the federal government and 49 states. Those banks are Ally, Bank of America, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo.

Home buyers unfazed by fires

AS THE mercury nudged 43 degrees, Allan Deadman sounded worried by the smoke he could see from Bendalong.

''I'm just about to jump on the fire truck,'' said Mr Deadman, a real estate agent with Ray White in the south coast holiday hamlet and a volunteer firefighter.

Under threat were Bendalong, Sussex Inlet and Wandandian, and it was not a new experience.

The Black Christmas fires of 2001 - which raged for 17 days and destroyed 115 homes across NSW - struck the area. As with the fires of last week, Bendalong was spared destruction but holidaymakers slept on the beach as the flames edged closer to houses.

Whether there is a link between property price movements and the bushfire threat that many country towns face is inconclusive.

Bendalong's close call in 2001 and the burnt-out nearby national park might well have discouraged some buyers. The data from Australian Property Monitors, however, shows property buyers have short memories or are prepared to take the risk.

The median house price more than doubled from $205,000 to $422,000 between the boom years of 2001 and 2004.

But it has been a very different holiday house market in recent years, with prices falling.

Yet Mr Deadman does not expect last week's fire threat to affect a situation that has improved recently as vendors adjusted expectations, tempting holiday home hunters from Sydney. The $220,000 to $300,000 market was particularly strong, he said.

''We've done three sales last week - we haven't exchanged yet - and we look like moving another two this weekend,'' he said.

The fire threat is also very real in the Blue Mountains.

In November 2006, blazes threatened Hazelbrook, Woodford and Linden.

Woodford's median house price fell 9.5 per cent over the next year, yet Hazelbrook's rose 3 per cent. There were too few sales in Linden to suggest a trend.

At Faulconbridge, which had also been under threat, prices dropped 3 per cent over the following year but leapt 6 per cent a year later.

APM was unable to determine a median price for the Victorian town of Marysville in 2010 that would reflect the degree of devastation brought by Black Saturday conflagrations of 2009, which destroyed many properties and killed 173 people.

Rod Evans, of Parkville, owned a two-bedroom 1930s fibro cottage in Murchison Street, Marysville, which was razed.

''It was a weekender, so it's lucky we weren't there,'' he said. ''We had been intending to go there the following day.''

Mr Evans chose not to rebuild, instead buying elsewhere, but is only now getting round to selling the large block - for $205,000. He says it would suit a family home or even home units.

''People who are rebuilding are putting up some very nice-looking houses and there's now some nice public facilities,'' Mr Evans said. ''Marysville is coming alive again.''

Florida Pension Sponsor Primes 1.7B Investments

The Sunshine State's State Board of Administration (SBA) incorporated more than $1.7 billion in new commitments, ranging from international developed and nontraditional strategies, when 2012's fourth quarter concluded.

None of the investments caused a fatal blow to any current asset management contracts,  John Kuczwanski, communications manager at the agency, confirmed Wednesday.

According to the SBA's reporting for 2012's fourth quarter, about $50 million was committed to AQR Capital Management. The funds were directed to firm's emerging market small-cap accounts.  

"The global equity was made by rebalancing among managers to maintain appropriate diversification," Kuczwanski said.

With the remainder of the commitments, the pension manager for the Florida Retirement System (FRS) noted in its report that the remaining $1.2 billion was allocated to private equity, real estate and strategic investments.

Kuczwanski noted that the remainder of the commitments was sifted from the plan's liquidity holding, with no managers facing terminations from the funding.

For private equity, the SBA further explained that about $104.6 million or ?80 million was allocated to Advent International's GPE VII fund, and $100 million to each Silver Lake Partners' IV fund, Lexington Partners' Middle Market Investment III fund, EnerVest's Energy IST Fund XIII-A, and EnCap Investments' Energy Capital Fund IX.

With the remaining investments, the SBA said that $100 million was also allocated to a real estate strategy managed by Starwood Capital Group and RK Equity's RK Mine Finance Fund II, a strategic investment for the Tallahassee, Fla.-based retirement system.

Additional "strategic" commitments included $200 million each going to CarVal Investors' CVI Credit Value Fund II A, Scout Capital's second fund, and GSO Capital Partners, the credit business of The Blackstone Group.

Alternately, Industry Funds Management was granted about $300 million to be allocated to a global infrastructure vehicle, and ABRY Partners was given a $60 million commitment.

Previously, Kuczwanksi said Oct. 9 that commitments made in the third quarter were "funded from general liquidity." He noted that $1.3 billion in strategic, private equity and real estate investments make up a larger plan that includes goals laid out in the 2010 investment policy statement.

The pension plan manager's goals stated the FRS was to raise its alternatives ceiling to 16%. The spokesperson said over the fall that the process was to be "implemented in two phases."

"The first phase was completed within prior statutory limits, with the final expansion requiring legislative authority to invest beyond the prior 10% cap on alternatives," he said Tuesday in an email. "The expanded authority, from 10% to 20% (although we only plan to go to 16%) was passed during the latest legislative session ending March 2012."

As of Aug. 31, actual allocations included 4.7% to strategic investments, 5.2% to private equity and 7.5% to real estate. However, policy weights were situated at 11% for strategic, 5% for private equity and 7% for real estate.

Verizon CEO Sees More Than 130,000 New FiOS Customers in 4Q

Hurricane cleanup, pension obligations and debt-restructuring costs will burden Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) with as much as $10 billion in one-time charges, Chief Executive Lowell McAdam told investors, though the carrier's wireless segment continued to report strong growth.

Speaking to investors at Citi's annual technology conference in Las Vegas, Mr. McAdam said the telecom provider's Verizon Wireless subsidiary expects a net gain of 2.1 million subscribers in the fourth quarter, the best in its history. The company also added 130,000 new FiOS television subscriptions.

Verizon still expects heavy expenses borne during and after Hurricane Sandy, which slammed much of the heavily populated northeast U.S. and flooded the company's New York headquarters.

"We certainly took a hit because of Sandy," he said. "For probably two months, the vast majority of our people were dedicated to the repair and the cleanup."

As part of its cleanup, Verizon has disclosed plans to pull out more than 130 tons of copper wiring from the affected area and replace it with fiber-optic cable to lower its long-term maintenance costs.

The chief executive Monday detailed more of the costs of those efforts, including a roughly $1 billion impact from the superstorm, a third of which should be covered by insurance. Verizon also expects a roughly $1.5 billion charge in the fourth quarter to restructure debt under more attractive lending terms, plus about $7 billion of mark-to-market losses associated with the company's employee pension plan.

Total charges during the quarter could range between $9 billion and $10 billion, Mr. McAdam said.

Bernstein Research analyst Craig Moffett said the pension charge was large but not unexpected considering the company's past guidance. Wireless subscriber growth beat Bernstein's projections, however.

"Verizon has been running the table in wireless, and everyone else is just struggling to stay in the game," Mr. Moffett said.

Verizon, like many of its peers, has shifted more investment to its wireless segment as mobile devices offer stronger growth prospects. Mr. McAdam still said recent union concessions should help the company's wired telecom business increase its margins in the coming quarters.

Earlier, in an interview ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Mr. McAdam said Verizon could pull off the acquisition of its wireless joint venture with Vodafone Group PLC (VOD, VOD.LN).

"We have always said we would love to own all of that asset," he said. He added, though, that the venture is functioning well and consolidation of the ownership isn't necessary. Verizon Wireless is 55% owned by Verizon and 45% by Vodafone.

Shares of Verizon rose as high as 1.6% Monday before settling up 39 cents at $44.69. The stock has climbed 17% over the past year.

Calpers main fund posted 0.1 pct gain in fiscal 2011-12

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The California Public Employees' Retirement System said on Thursday rates for its member agencies will increase after it posted a net investment return of 0.1 percent in its core fund for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2012, compared with a net return of 21.7 percent in the prior fiscal year.

Agencies using the retirement system to manage pension accounts have been expecting rate increases after it released a preliminary report in July on its disappointing 2011-2012 fiscal year performance.

That report said the system, best known as Calpers, posted a 1 percent gain for the year due to Europe's debt crisis and slowing global growth.

Calpers' board last March also put the system's member agencies on notice of rate increases by voting to lower its longstanding 7.75 percent assumed rate of return to 7.5 percent.

Calpers, the biggest U.S. public pension system, said on Thursday in its Comprehensive Annual Financial Report that net assets in its main fund, the Public Employees' Retirement Fund, totaled $237.0 billion at the end of its 2011-2012 fiscal year.

The value of Calpers' assets was $251.8 billion as of Wednesday, according to a spokesman for the retirement system.

Most contribution rates for state agency and school employers in the 2013-2014 fiscal year and for local government employers in the 2014-2015 fiscal year are not expected to increase by more than 2 percent of payroll, Calpers said in Thursday's report.

If Calpers earns its assumed 7.5 percent investment return in its 2012-2013 fiscal year, employer rates for state and school employers in its 2014-2015 fiscal year and for local agencies in its 2015-2016 fiscal year are expected to increase in most cases between 0.2 percent and 0.7 percent of payroll, the report said.

The rates could increase more if Calpers earns less than 7.5 percent, the report said.

Local governments using the Calpers system keep a close eye on the rates as pension costs have become a top financial concern in a time of tight public budgets across the most populous U.S. state.

San Bernardino, a city of 210,000 east of Los Angeles, has opted to withhold payments to Calpers while seeking bankruptcy court protection from its creditors.

A U.S. bankruptcy judge last month ruled against an attempt by Calpers to collect overdue payments from San Bernardino, the first city to halt payments to the fund and challenge its primacy as a creditor.

Stockton, California, also declared bankruptcy last year but has made payments in full to Calpers. Vallejo, California, also made its payments to Calpers during the course of its bankruptcy proceedings. Vallejo emerged from bankruptcy in 2011.

Selling Your Home? Leave For The Showing

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 20, 2012 /PRNewswire-iReach/ -- If your home is for sale, you've probably read all kinds of tips on how to get potential buyers to swing by for a showing. But what do you do once they get there? If you're smart, you're nowhere to be found!

Real estate tips: Buying a condo, what makes it different?

Lots of homeowners think it's a great idea to stick around for showings. After all, no one knows their house like they do. By being there, they can tell potential buyers things that a realtor couldn't possibly know. And, they can put a "human" touch on the showing. For example, they can talk about rocking their newborn son to sleep in his bedroom or serving their first Thanksgiving turkey in the dining room.

Real estate outlook: First time home buyers outlook for 2013

While all of that may sound nice on the surface, it can actually prevent your home from selling. According to Realtypin.com, the goal of the showing is for potential buyers to envision themselves living there. That's impossible for them to do if you're hovering over them like a cat eyeing a canary. It makes potential buyers feel like guests -- or worse, like they're intruding on your personal space. They might even feel like you're rushing them.

When people wind up in situations like that, they feel awkward. Unfortunately, they're going to translate that feeling to the house itself. And, as you might have guessed, people don't make offers on houses that make them feel awkward.

So, what can you do?

- Trust the realtor doing the showing. After all, this person is a professional. And, remember, the realtor has a stake in this, too. If the showing leads to a sale, the realtor gets a commission. So, it's in the realtor's best interest to talk up all of the good points about your home!

- Try to put yourself in the potential buyer's shoes. What kind of environment would you want if you were touring a home for sale?

- Talk to your own realtor. Discuss the features that made you fall in love with your home. That way, your realtor can make sure that potential buyers know all about them.

Finally, if you insist on putting a more "human" touch on your home sale, don't do it in person. Instead, leave a short handwritten note that highlights some of the great experiences you've had in the house. That way, potential buyers can read it during their showing, without the awkwardness of having you there to talk to them in person.

DJ Canada Pension Funds on Short List for $3B Australia Ports

--Canadian funds on short list to lease ports, people familiar with matter say

--Deals could raise nearly US$3 billion to fund infrastructure development

--Both ports are located in New South Wales state

(Revises first paragraph, adds background and details)

By Gillian Tan

SYDNEY--Four Canadian pension funds are among the shortlisted bidders seeking to lease two major ports in Australia, in deals that could raise nearly US$3 billion to fund Australian infrastructure such as highways and rail lines.

The ports on offer are Port Botany and Port Kembla in New South Wales state.

The four pension funds are part of two consortia that include three members each, people familiar with the matter said Wednesday.

One consortium, advised by Macquarie Capital, is comprised of Alberta Investment Management Corp., Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Australia's QIC. The other, advised by J.P. Morgan and RBC Capital Markets, is comprised of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, Borealis Infrastructure, a unit of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, and Australia's Hastings Funds Management.

New South Wales Treasurer Mike Baird has estimated that leasing the ports will raise around 2.8 billion Australian dollars (US$2.96 billion)--A$2.3 billion for Port Botany and A$500 million for Port Kembla. The process is being led by Morgan Stanley.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Baird said the shortlisted parties were notified Wednesday, but she declined to give any details.

Final bids are due in early April, one of the people said. Mr. Baird said earlier this year that he hoped the process would be concluded by the middle of next year.

Port Botany handles more than US$40 billion of trade each year, from at least 2 million containers, making it the nation's second-largest container port by volume.

Port Kembla has been in operation since the 1890s. It is a hub for coal, steel and grain, and is the largest vehicle-importing terminal in Australia.

Eager to diversify their portfolios, Canadian pension funds have completed many overseas deals in recent years, turning to infrastructure assets because they offer stable returns compared with equities and commodities.

Australia is an attractive destination because a commodities-and-energy boom has helped shield its economy from the headwinds buffeting other developed regions such as the U.S. and Europe.

The nation's six states must raise their own money to pay for infrastructure not funded by the federal government, and to pay state workers such as bus drivers and bureaucrats.

Queensland and South Australia have recently come under pressure from ratings firms over their ailing finances.

Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services gave New South Wales's infrastructure-privatization plan a broad tick, so its triple-A rating remains secure for now.

YOUR MONEY-Best 401(k) plans take fees into consideration

NEW YORK, Dec 11 (Reuters) - Much of what makes a great retirement plan depends upon the cost to participants and the generosity of the company to its workers.

These are among the criteria that BrightScope uses to rank the top 30 401(k) plans at big companies with more than $1 billion in plan assets. The financial information service also look at participation rates, level of salary deferrals and average account balances, to come up with its list of the best among the 429 largest 401(k) plans.

"Less-obvious 401k plan components like immediate plan eligibility and vesting significantly increase participation rates and therefore employees' chances of a secure financial future," says Mike Alfred, CEO and co-founder of BrightScope, which rates more than 46,000 retirement plans.

Some plan design features were common: Costs averaged 0.29 percent, a drop of 1.5 basis points since 2010. Twenty-four of the top 30 had immediate eligibility. Also, 21 of the plans offered immediate vesting of company match contributions.

For investing options, more participants are picking index funds, now accounting for 29.5 percent of assets, in contrast to 25.4 percent in 2010. Collective trusts - which pool together assets are also popular, at 28.7 percent of assets, in contrast to 24 percent in 2010. Also growing: target date funds, up to 4.9 percent from 3.6 percent in 2012.

The top company was a newcomer to the list, Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan, of Houston, Texas. The company matches 100 percent of the first 7 percent contributed to the plan, with an average contribution level of more than $23,000 per participant. BrightScope notes, "This generosity, in turn, helped push the average salary deferral for the plan to over $38,000 per participant."

Among notable major companies, Google Inc., came in at 11 and IBM at 14. The financial services industry was also well-represented with Credit Suisse (7), The Roche (18), Ernst & Young (19), UBS (24), Goldman Sachs (27) and Deloitte (30) on the list.

The top ten plans are:

1. Marathon Oil Company Thrift Plan, Houston, Texas

2. The Savings Plan of Saudi Arabian Oil Company, Houston, Texas

3. Southwest Airlines Pilots' Retirement Savings Plan, Dallas, Texas

4. Wellington Retirement and Pension Plan, Boston, Massachusetts

5. Amgen Retirement and Savings Plan, Thousand Oaks, California

6. United Airlines Pilot Directed Account Plan, Chicago, Illinois

7. Employees Savings and Retirement Plan of Credit Suisse, New York, New York

8. Sanofi-Aventis US Savings Plan, Bridgewater, NJ

9. Southern California Permanente Medical Group Retirement Plan, Pasadena, California

10. Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Savings and Investment Program, New York, New York

Air Canada seeks pension relief; Staring down $4.2-billion pension deficit, airline asks finance minister for help

Air Canada wants to cap special payments toward its pension fund deficit at $150 million a year for the next decade, a letter from chief executive officer Calin Rovinescu to Finance Minister Jim Flaherty shows.

The April 26 letter, received by Reuters on Thursday under access-to-information legislation, formally requested a cap of that amount from 2014 through 2023, as long as the pension fund remained in deficit.

Air Canada has already won approval from its labour unions and its pensioners for a cap, but as recently as Nov. 8, Rovinescu declined in a conference call with analysts to confirm that the amount of the cap he was seeking was $150 million.

Rovinescu said the $2.2 billion increase in Air Canada's pension deficit during 2011 was the result of a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate pension liabilities, to 3.3 per cent from 4.5 per cent.

"This is not sustainable in the current context, assuming no material increase in interest rates," Rovinescu wrote to Flaherty.

He said the increase brought the total deficit to $4.4 billion. The airline, Canada's largest, has subsequently revised that down to $4.2 billion.

Air Canada, like other employers with defined-benefit pension plans, has been badly hurt by the decline in the interest rates that are used to calculate solvency gaps.

All but seven per cent of Canada's federally regulated, private defined-benefit plans were underfunded at the end of 2011, the federal supervisor said on Oct. 5.

In his conference call with analysts on Nov. 8, Rovinescu said, "We have no assurance of being able to get anything along the lines of what has been asked" for a cap on the special pension payments. "I think that there were some references that were made in the arbitration materials that talked about the numbers along the lines of what you've indicated.

"We're not able to confirm that's been granted, and so we're hopeful of having funding that's satisfactory, but until it's done, it's not done."

Following approval by the unions and pensioners for the cap, the airline is now awaiting Flaherty's decision on whether to approve it. Flaherty's office has so far declined to hint when he will decide.

In 2009, Air Canada won agreement from the government for a moratorium on making any special payments to reduce its pension deficit through 2010, and then a cap on special payments that would rise from $150 million in 2011 to $225 million in 2013.

Justifying his request, Rovinescu told the finance minister how the airline had "worked diligently to address our pension solvency challenges." The pension plans have delivered top quartile performance in the past three years, he said.

Mark Blinch, Reuters / Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu says the company's underfunded pension plans have performed well recently.;

HOT BUTTON: VOTERS REJECT SALES TAX HIKE

By more than a 2-to-1 margin, voters in Memphis and unincorporated parts of Shelby County on Tuesday soundly rejected a proposal to increase the county sales tax by a half-cent. The tax hike would have raised about $60 million, including $30 million for public schools.

County Commission chairman Mike Ritz proposed the tax as a way to help offset an anticipated $57 million budget deficit for the merged city and county school system.

Here are excerpts from comments online readers of The Commercial Appeal posted on a Nov. 7 article about the vote:

Earlier this year the citizens of the municipalities outside of Memphis were asked to vote to tax themselves for education in their communities. Answer: Yes.

Then the citizens of Memphis vote on whether to tax themselves for education. Answer: No.

Draw your own conclusions.

... Another property tax increase (as an alternative to the sales tax increase)? On the contrary.

The answer is simple: Cut spending. The best place to start is the ridiculous pensions so many city employees get. ...

Memphisjj wrote:

So, will the County Commission and City Council start reducing spending now that a big majority of the citizens voted against yet another tax?

Most people trim their home/family budgets by not spending what they don't have. The commission and council should try that. ...

This was an absurd proposal. Asking people to approve payment of something so ill-defined is not good government. The Unified School Board should come up with a realistic plan and budget first that's the way to go. Keep wild-eyed, arm-waving politicians and outsiders such as Stand For Children out of the picture and focus on real needs. ...

The plan for the new school system should be based on reality, not some idealized world-class system as now envisioned. Start with the basics first, then grow it. ...

Then, come back to the taxpayers and ask for new funding. That would stand a chance of approval. ...

The Democrats in this county did not support this tax increase because it is a tax they would have to pay. They only want the rich to pay more taxes. They like to live off other people's money.

Bford#396192 wrote:

... My opinion is that this was just an effort to hinder the muni school effort. (The) vote gives further evidence to the lack of support of the schools by the majority of city of Memphis residents. Once again, the economies of scale realized by a unified school system will not happen and a property tax increase will occur.

I voted for the sales tax increase. I would rather every citizen of Memphis contribute rather (than) those of us that own property being the only citizens having to foot the entire bill.

Oh well, I'll prepare for a higher property tax bill meanwhile, the freeloaders in this city will continue to freeload.

DEAR AMY: I was involved with a married man for more than 15 years. He was going to leave his wife to be with me, but it never happened. I was naive and thought he was serious about our relationship because we saw each other morning, noon and night. We had so much in common and enjoyed every minute we were together.

After the affair ended, we remained good friends. We still have friends in common and communicate by cellphone. He stops by my house on a regular basis. Recently, he told me that he and his wife were going to downsize to a smaller house. He owns a lot of land and there are a lot of places he could build his "retirement home," but he tells me it will be on property adjacent to me!

What kind of man would do something like that? His wife doesn't like me, but she has no idea about the extent of my relationship with her husband. My neighbours and friends who knew about our relationship have said that he should have picked another location. They think that he is being self-centred and inconsiderate of my feelings.

I am still reeling from this. What do you imagine he is thinking?

-- FRUSTRATED FORMER

DEAR FRUSTRATED: You claim that after your sexual affair ended you maintained a long-term friendship with this man, entertaining him in your home and talking frequently on the phone.

I suspect your former flame imagines that he can continue to be your friend, only now from next door. If you don't want him to build a house next to you, it would be a good idea to stop discussing this with mutual friends and start discussing this with him. He doesn't sound like someone who has much respect for boundaries, but you should do your best to draw them now.

DEAR AMY: I assist a mildly disabled woman with her financial affairs and a few other things. I'm happy to do it. In return, she insists on giving me food that she has cooked. Amy, she is a dreadful cook!My husband and I have even gotten sick from some of her "gifts."

I also hate to see her using her limited funds to buy ingredients for this food. How can I stop her without hurting her feelings? Throwing the food away seems wasteful, and we wouldn't dare inflict it on someone else.

-- GRATEFUL BUT QUEASY

DEAR GRATEFUL: You might be able to direct your friend's giving by steering her toward something she can make that you can also stomach. You can say, "You are so nice to cook for us. You know what we'd really love? Chocolate chip cookies. Can you make those? We'd love to keep some in our freezer."

The dough is available in no-fail, pre-mixed versions. You might be able to direct her toward this.

Homeowners snap up low-rate US loans

American homeowners are rushing to refinance mortgages at near-historic low rates, with loan applications last week staying close to three-year highs.

Traders and loan originators are awaiting more signals from the Federal Reserve, which is now the biggest buyer of wholesale mortgages, that could prompt a big increase in the amount of mortgages available at ultra-low rates.

A slight decline in applications last week reflected a modest rebound in mortgage rates and a debate in financial markets about how much further rates could fall. After the Fed announced on September 13 that it would buy an unlimited amount of mortgage-backed securities at a rate of about $70bn a month until unemployment came down, mortgage refinance applications surged to their highest levels since 2009, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The number of refinancing applications declined 2 per cent last week, after a 20 per cent jump in the previous seven days. The number of mortgage applications overall, including for new home purchases, was down 1.2 per cent. "Volume is still near three-year highs, and purchase applications increased to the highest level since June," said Mike Fratantoni, the MBA's vice-president of research and economics.

The level of refinancings is critical to the effectiveness of the Fed's bond-buying programme, since they could put additional money in homeowners' pockets and help boost demand in the economy. By bringing down mortgage rates, the Fed is also hoping to stoke a housing market recovery.

However, the initial downward pressure on mortgage rates appears to have eased somewhat. The average rate on a 30-year mortgage guaranteed by the government agency Freddie Mac fell to a record low of 3.36 per cent last week, from 3.55 per cent before the Fed's quantitative easing programme was announced. The latest weekly figure is published by the agency on Thursday.

HSH, a private organisation that also tracks mortgage rates on a daily basis, has seen a rebound in rates. It is currently showing an average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at 3.53 per cent, up from a trough of 3.39 per cent. MBS traders believe that a step-change lower in rates could only come if the Fed moves to make substantial purchases of ultra-low rate loans in the wholesale market.

New MBS are pre-sold in buckets divided according to the coupon, or rate, and the Fed's buying activity has so far been concentrated in these so-called "pass throughs" with a coupon of 3 per cent or above. However, a recent surge in activity in purchases of 2.5 per cent pass-throughs suggests the Fed has begun buying at these new low levels.

On Tuesday, $617m of 2.5 per cent pass-throughs traded, according to FINRA data, more than twice the ten-day average. The trades help set a price, and prove demand for mortgages with ultra-low rates.

CPA call to quash lump-sum mentality

THE $30 billion in tax breaks for Australia's compulsory superannuation scheme is failing to take pressure off the age pension and the federal budget as retiring baby boomers take lump-sum entitlements to pay off their mortgages instead of funding their retirement.

A report to be released today by CPA Australia suggests the nation is headed for a retirement savings ``disaster'' and calls on the government to examine placing limits on access to lump-sum payments upon retirement.

The report Household Savings and Retirement, compiled by Simon Kelly, the former principal research fellow in the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling at the University of Canberra, found superannuation was being used by retirees to extinguish debt accumulated during their working lives to allow them to live beyond their income levels.

The report comes as the federal government canvasses the superannuation industry for potential savings as it seeks to compensate for lower revenues caused by the lower commodity prices and a raft of new spending promises.

Speculation has centred on whether the government might curb tax breaks on super for high-income earners or narrow tax breaks for borrowing on property through self-managed super funds.

People approaching retirement age were using the equity in the family home as a source of funds to assist their children into home ownership, to fund an overseas trip, retire early or simply to live a lifestyle their income could not support, rather than saving it as a retirement nest egg.

This was adding to an unrealistic expectation of retirement

lifestyle.

The report also warns that higher household incomes, with both partners working, access to easy credit and asset inflation had increased retirement expectations, but the current system would not be able to deliver these higher expectations.

``This study is a stark illustration that the superannuation system, as currently configured, has failed miserably in its aim of encouraging more Australians to save for retirement,'' CPA Australia chief executive Alex Malley said.

``Many who have spent a large portion of their working lives under this system will still be relying on the pension.''

The report, to be released today by Australia's largest accounting body, found average household superannuation balances grew 42 per cent between 2002 and 2010, while non-superannuation financial assets grew by 17 per cent and property assets by 60 per cent at the same time as property debt grew by 94 per cent and other debt grew by 50 per cent.

The study suggested that each dollar contributed to compulsory superannuation was offset by a 30 per cent reduction in other savings.

``The results could not be clearer,'' Mr Malley said. ``Australian taxpayers are facing a massive bill.''

Mr Malley said given the compulsory nature of the scheme it would be worth considering the use of compulsory income streams in retirement and moves away from the ``lump sum as windfall'' mentality that could be blamed for the riskier investment and spending behaviour.

XRAYSER: Agreement is like turkeys voting for Xmas

Wednesday evening. Jane's on holiday, and to save on 'extra duty' payments I've not covered all her shifts. Another staff member was making an urgent delivery, so for 15 minutes I was alone in the pharmacy - a situation that could become the norm judging by recent financial announcements.

The NHS cut to our payments is the equivalent to the cost of employing two full-time technicians. Or I could stop my pension payments and take a 6 per cent pay cut. Or, as 'interim agreement' is an anagram of 'man retire meeting', perhaps they're trying to tell me to just lock the door and chuck the keys away. Because that's how I feel having seen the PSNC so-say negotiated so-called interim agreement - the sort of interim arrangement that turkeys agree at Christmas.

Yes, we all know the NHS needs to make umpteen billion pounds savings, but those savings were to be made by having no increase in funding. It seems now that, single-handedly, pharmacy is funding the whole bloody deficit itself and I'll need a back-up pension plan.

And if I'm thinking this way, how much greater will be the need to slash and burn costs if you have shareholders to satisfy? Or high overheads such as a 100-hour contract? Or if a 100-hour contract had opened near your business just before the cut-off date, and until this you thought you might just cling on...

I'm so angry I'm not even going to ask about fairness because fairness stopped years ago, but what I do expect is a bit of honesty from the Department of Health. Having been persuaded to end the 100-hour exemption by - in part - the argument around cost, are they now planning savings by reducing contract numbers? Will they be truthful and say: "We're going to make it uneconomical to own a pharmacy until enough contracts have shut down, the surplus of corpses with certificates means pharmacist pay rates will match that in Northern Ireland, and the responsible pharmacist will be the one who pulls plastic sheeting over his cardboard box before going to sleep."

Of course, I realise we've been here before. I've lost count of the times we've been going to financial hell in a handcart, yet I can still afford to put claret on the dinner table and pharmacy agents still report healthy sales of sound businesses. No, the real problem is uncertainty - the very 'interim' nature of the agreement as the cost of service inquiry approaches its third birthday, and the rumours of a new contract.

Instead of all these temporary measures we need surety of income over at least five years so we can plan and invest, because the financial alternative to that is to gamble - which gets you nowhere. Certainly my back-up pension plan has never got me further than two numbers and the bonus ball.

2012 SEP 28 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Economics Week -- Stone Harbor Investment Partners LP ("Stone Harbor"), a global fixed income investment firm focused on credit fixed income and asset allocation strategies, announced the addition of William Perry to the firm's investment team as an Emerging Markets Corporate Debt Portfolio Manager.

Mr. Perry has 28 years of industry experience and will be based in the firm's New York headquarters. Prior to joining Stone Harbor, Mr. Perry served as an Emerging Markets Corporate Debt Portfolio Manager at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.

"We are pleased to announce this new addition to our Emerging Markets Debt team," said Peter Wilby, CIO of Stone Harbor. "Bill Perry is an exceptional new resource for Stone Harbor, particularly considering the growing opportunities we see within the emerging markets corporate debt space. We are confident that Bill will make substantial contributions to the team and our existing strategies as we continue to pursue excellent returns for our clients."

"I have long admired Stone Harbor's experienced team, its consistent investment approach and its focus on performance and client service," said Mr. Perry. "I look forward to starting this new chapter in my career at Stone Harbor."

Mr. Perry will work closely with Chris Wilder, Stone Harbor's London-based emerging markets corporate debt portfolio manager. According to Mr. Wilder, "Year-to-date, as of September( )7, 2012, EM corporates have returned 10.97% as measured by the JP Morgan CEMBI Broad Diversified Index. Compared to developed market corporates, we think EM corporates generally have superior credit fundamentals, higher growth, yet offer a more attractive yield. EM corporates have benefited from the improving credit quality of EM sovereigns generally and dollar corporate issuance has surpassed dollar EM sovereign issuance by roughly 3 to 1 in recent years. We expect this to continue."

Estate tax change would affect 12.3M households

From Our Press Services

HARTFORD, Conn. - An additional 12.3 million households in the U.S. would have a potential tax liability if the Bush-era estate tax rates expire as scheduled on Dec. 31, according to research released Tuesday by the life-insurance trade group LIMRA of Windsor, Conn.

The current estate tax means that about 2.4 million of the wealthiest U.S. households face a potential tax liability at death, but if the current law expires at the end of the year, 14.7 million households could face an estate tax, LIMRA reports.

At issue is the ongoing debate by members of Congress about the future of all tax rates. The federal estate tax is a one-time tax on real estate, life insurance, trusts, annuities, business interests, cash, securities and other assets transferred through a person's will at the time of his or her death, usually to children or other family members.

The vast majority of Americans would still be exempt from an estate tax even if it reverts to higher rates. The higher rates, if the current rate expires, would affect about 12.5 percent of U.S. households. The current rate affects about 2 percent of households.

The current rate exempts the first $5 million in assets, and the rest is subject to a tax rate up to 35 percent. If the law expires and Congress doesn't act to extend it, or to modify the changes scheduled for Dec. 31, the exemption would drop to the first $1 million in assets and the rest could be taxed up to 55 percent.

Some in Congress have mentioned a possible compromise plan of exempting the first $3.5 million and taxing up to 45 percent for assets beyond that.

The $1 million threshold is the total of all assets - such as the total of a $450,000 house and $550,000 in retirement savings, ownership of a business, stocks, cash, secondary property and other assets.

If the current estate tax law is extended, 2.4 million of the wealthiest U.S. households would have a potential estate tax liability. At 35 percent, the average estate tax would be $2.4 million.

If the rate expires, the 14.7 million households facing a potential estate tax liability would have an average tax of $1.4 million at death.

LIMRA is not proposing a particular rate, but the trade group is advocating for some stability in the tax code.

"The uncertainty that has surrounded our estate tax laws has made it impossible for Americans to plan for a reasonable transition of their assets to the ones they love and to charity for the greater good," said Robert Kerzner, president and CEO of LIMRA, LOMA and LL Global.

"Until we have long-term clarity on what the law will be, American families and small businesses will be challenged to make the prudent decisions to ensure their beneficiaries are protected," Kerzner said.

Gloves come off in ETF price war

The ongoing price war among providers of exchange-traded funds is heating up.

The Charles Schwab Corp. last Friday unveiled a round of fee cuts aimed at making its ETFs the lowest-cost funds in their categories. The move came just weeks after BlackRock Inc. said that it would implement strategic fee cuts in its iShares ETFs, the largest family of ETFs, with more than $500 billion in assets.

Both firms are following the lead of The Vanguard Group Inc., which has employed its emphasis on low-cost products to become the fastest-growing ETF firm in the industry.

The $1.13 billion Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB), for example, now costs 4 basis points, down from 6. It is now 2 basis points cheaper than the $23 billion Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI).

TARGETING CUTS

Schwab also is following BlackRock's lead in targeting fee cuts to the asset classes in which both companies compete with Vanguard.

Neither BlackRock nor Schwab is particularly hurting for attention. The iShares ETFs have had inflows of $63 billion over the past three years, second only to Vanguard's $73 billion, and Schwab's ETF business has grown to $7.5 billion since its launch in November 2009.

But in the core building-block-type ETFs, cost tends to matter most.

"They're commodity-type products," said Mike Rawson, an ETF analyst at Morningstar Inc. "The disparity between one index provider and another in those categories isn't that great, so people just tend to go with the cheapest."

Of course, because ETFs already have low fees, 1 or 2 basis points may not seem like a big difference. But without the fee cuts, BlackRock and Schwab could have risked losing investors to Vanguard because, thanks to the firm's unique structure, Vanguard can continue to lower prices.

Vanguard is owned by its funds - thus the shareholders of those funds - so expense ratios are kept at cost. As the funds grow larger, expense ratios fall because of economies of scale.

Because Vanguard's ETFs are share classes of its index funds, inflows into the index funds will allow ETF expense ratios to keep dropping.

Two-thirds of Vanguard ETFs have had fees cut over the past year, according to the company.

BlackRock hasn't been specific about its fee cuts, but Schwab seems committed to following Vanguard all the way down to the bottom.

"I'll leave it to your imagination as to how we might respond to followers who, late to the game, attempt to undercut our exceptional pricing," said Marie Chandoha, president of Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc.

So far, Vanguard doesn't seem to be worried.

"We're happy other companies are following our lead," said spokesman David Hoffman. "Lowering fees is something organic for us, and it will most likely happen again in the future."

Christine Hudacko, a spokeswoman for BlackRock, declined to comment.

New York Life Gives American College $5M for Ph.D. Program

New York Life announced Monday that it has awarded The American College $5 million to set up a new 12-course Ph.D. program in business administration-the only one of its kind-so that advisors can hone their skills in financial literacy and retirement planning.

The American College will begin accepting applications for the Ph.D. program in October.

Chris Blunt, president of New York Life's Insurance Group, said in a statement that "New York Life is proud to establish this much-needed doctorate program to enhance the services provided by financial professionals." The doctoral program, he said, will include an "unrivaled curriculum of financial literacy and retirement planning, designed to create world-class scholars whose research and teaching will provide financial professionals with the advanced information needed to better serve the people who are counting on them."

Blunt went on to note the crucial need for professional advice as Baby Boomers, who number about 77 million and who started turning 65 years old last year, "are facing a retirement that has drastically changed from the retirement of generations before them." Without the promise of a pension and the certainty of a "healthy" Social Security benefit, Blunt added that "many retirees need to more actively manage their income and pre-retirees need to better prepare for retirement," and that "many are in need of financial guidance and seek a knowledgeable professional."

Dr. Larry Barton, president and CEO of The American College, said in the same statement that graduates of the doctorate program will "create and disseminate the results of advanced research" in the area of financial services and retirement planning. "This new knowledge could have a profound impact on consumers and help millions of Americans achieve financial security during their golden years," he said.

Applicants must have a bachelor's degree from an accredited school and meet other qualifying requirements. Once students are accepted, the college says it will identify two cohort groups, each made up of 15 people, who will move through the coursework together on a mutually supportive basis. One cohort group would begin studies every six months, and the first residency is scheduled for July 2013.

Doctoral scholars will participate in three one-week residencies at The American College's campus in Bryn Mawr, Pa., as well as at least one intensive debrief with faculty prior to their dissertation defense. Students are required to complete one course per quarter online over 12 quarters in addition to the residencies.

 In late August, The American College announced it had developed a new designation, called the Retirement Income Certified Professional, or RICP.

In 2007, New York Life donated $2 million to establish the New York Life Center for Retirement Income at The American College to help address the demand for income solutions among retired Americans.

Those interested in the Ph.D. program can contact Nancy Krapf at 610-526-1202 or visit www.TheAmericanCollege.edu.

A fund of one

How one US pension plan is revising the definition of a 'commingled' fund to speed up investment

Finding ways of investing faster appears to be rife among US pension plans at the minute. Note last month's procedural shift by the Nebraska Investment Council, which removed the need for board approval for certain repeat commitments. The reasoning for the expedited process was to better enable the pension system to invest in vehicles prior to the first close, when better fees and terms are sometimes offered. If you ever wanted an indicator of how hot the US real estate market has become, measures likes these are surely one.

In addition, since the Nebraska case came to light, another one has cropped up. As PERE reported this week, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) has made a $100 million commitment to CityView Bay Area II.

This might seem like a run-of-the-mill commitment to a commingled fund. Indeed, that is what LACERA calls it. However, upon closer inspection, it much more closely resembles a separate account. There is only one limited partner, LACERA, and the pension plan has complete control over areas such as general partner termination, fund extensions and cessation of investment period. It also has retained the right to own the projects outright upon completion as long-term core assets and already has drawn up a true separate account management agreement with CityView to be used if and when it acquires full interests.

So, why hasn't LACERA just committed to a separate account rather than what it technically defines as commingled fund? The answer is the need for speed.

If LACERA had made this commitment as a separate account, it would first have had to go through a time-consuming request for proposal (RFP) process that typically requires six to nine months to complete. However, it doesn't want to miss out on opportunities now.

Still, there is no 'legal' definition for what constitutes a commingled fund. In addition, unlike some investors, LACERA does not have a limit on the percentage of a commingled fund that its investment can represent.

It's also important to note that not all state pension plans are subject to RFP processes for separate account managers or other real estate hires One large public pension that PERE spoke with has made its multiple separate account manager hires without putting mandates out for public bid. For LACERA, the need to engage in an RFP process becomes an additional hurdle and potentially puts it at a competitive disadvantage. This unique fund structure is one way for the pension plan to level the playing field without breaking the rules.

Of course, not all pension funds in the US will be following suit in finding ways to expedite the investment process. However, with the US market appearing so hot right now and investors not wishing to be too late to opportunities, one can expect more pension plans to find ways to be more nimble.

Compulsory pension for West workers

Around 677,000 workers in the South West will automatically pay into a company pension under Government plans to avert mass hardship in retirement.

From October 1, staff working for large firms and not currently in a workplace scheme will see pay reduced by 1%, with the cash placed into savings and matched by the employer.

The move will affect people earning more than the income tax threshold, which is currently £8,105. Small firms will not be involved until June 2015 at the earliest.

In the greater South West, just 41% of private sector workers, or 471,000 people, make payments into a workplace pension scheme. The figure has fallen sharply since 2002, when 57% paid into a company scheme.

The number of private sector workers paying into pension schemes has plummeted to its lowest level since records began in 1953.

Around nine-in-ten public sector workers have a staterun scheme, meaning the reform will largely affect the private sector.

The automatic enrolment scheme, which has been described as the biggest pensions shake-up in more than a century, aims to tackle concerns about a growing old age poverty crisis, as people are living for longer but failing to put away enough for their later years.

Workers can choose to opt out of the scheme once they have been enrolled under "soft compulsion". The Government believes less than onethird will opt-out. Employers will eventually contribute 3% of earnings, individuals 4% of earnings, and there will also be 1% from the Government to make up a total contribution of 8%.

Pensions Minister Steve Webb told the Western Morning News: "We've got millions and millions of people who don't have a pension, so when they retire they will get a pension from the state and not much else. They will be on a very low standard of living in retirement. "If we do nothing, fewer and fewer people will have a workbased pensions and will retire into poverty. We can't really think of any other way of enabling these millions of workers to retire with a decent standard of living. We could force them to save, which reduces the freedom of choice. We could tax everybody and have a much higher state pension.

This seems to us the right balance."

Asked whether the timing was inconvenient as Britain remains in recession and households are struggling to pay bills, he said: "There's never a great time to do this. It's already been delayed quite significantly. It's been talked about for years and years."

Anne Marie Morris, Conservative MP for Newton Abbot, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Micro Businesses, said she was pleased so many South West workers would be paying into a pension. But she added: "It is important that our small and micro businesses receive the help they will need to ensure that all employees have the opportunity to enjoy the benefits auto-enrolment will bring."

Three Tips For Building A Lasting Retirement

MILWAUKEE, Sept. 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Retirement planning is constantly changing making it necessary to have a solid retirement strategy. In the past, many could rely on pension plans and social security benefits, but pension plans are increasingly rare(1) and Social Security benefits should not be used as a sole source of retirement.

Many Americans are at risk of running out of money in retirement. According to a recent Employee Benefit Research Institute study (EBRI), nearly 47 percent of early baby boomers (ages 56 to 62) are at risk of outliving their retirement savings. "To develop a sustainable strategy that meets your specific needs, some important considerations would be your age at retirement, life expectancy, living expenses and the rate of return you expect from your investments," said Dean Urbanski, Vice President, BMO Harris Financial Advisors, Inc., a part of BMO Financial Group.

Here are a few tips from Urbanksi on planning for retirement.


   -- Withdrawal Strategy: Knowing how much money should be withdrawn from your 
      retirement savings each year is a critical factor in building a 
      retirement plan. Withdraw too much and you are likely to outlive your 
      assets; take too little and you may unnecessarily sacrifice your standard 
      of living, especially in the early years of retirement. 
 
   -- Asset Allocation: As individuals seek increased income upon entering 
      retirement, they often shift their holdings more toward bonds and cash. 
      This may or may not be a good move, as there are other key investment 
      considerations beyond having a need for income. Confer with your 
      financial advisor to determine the appropriate allocation for your needs, 
      investment objective, risk profile and timeframe. 
 
   -- A core of guaranteed income: In retirement your focus will need to shift 
      to using your savings to generate income to meet your ongoing expenses. 
      One possible option is to allocate a portion of your savings to an 
      annuity. Annuities are an investment tool that can provide guaranteed 
      income for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live. 

Said Urbanksi, "Whatever your specific plans, it's crucial that you enter retirement with a strategy for turning your savings into a retirement 'paycheck' that will allow you to live retirement on your own terms." To learn how to begin, contact your BMO Harris Financial Advisor or visit www.bmoharris.com/financialadvisors.

Certified COBRA Administrator COBRAGuard Inc. Awarded Contract with State of North Carolina

OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Sept. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- After a transparent and highly competitive bid process, the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees awarded benefits administration contracts to five companies, including Kansas City-based COBRAGuard. The state provides benefits for approximately 664,000 people. With this decision, it expects to save $22.4 million, roughly 19 percent, compared to last year.

COBRAGuard will take over as the state's new COBRA administration partner effective July 1, 2013, and will serve for a contracted term of three and a half years. The company will provide a full range of COBRA administration and direct billing services. The contract is valued at approximately $1.2 million annually.

"We are delighted to be chosen as North Carolina's COBRA administration partner," COBRAGuard President Robert Meyers said. "Our goal is to help the state save time and operate efficiently, while delivering exceptional service and secure online account access for COBRA participants. The state was able to drive down costs by splitting the administration contract between several highly efficient, niche-focused companies. Other public entities should consider North Carolina's innovative strategy."

COBRAGuard has a long history of successfully serving public entities. The company serves more than 1,000 cities, counties, municipalities, school districts and universities across the nation, with the addition of North Carolina. In 2011, the company announced the formation of a public entity division. Meyers serves as a councilman for the city of Roeland Park, Kan., so he has firsthand understanding of public entity challenges and a unique desire to help them thrive. "At COBRAGuard, we don't see ourselves as vendors," Meyers said. "We are highly engaged and adaptable problem solvers who extend the capabilities of the organizations we serve."

Outsourcing benefit management is becoming more common, said Jan White, president of the Society for Human Resource Management of Greater Kansas City. White also is HR director for the Visiting Nurse Association of Kansas City. "COBRA is just one of those regulations that a lot of people find cumbersome to manage, and if you can outsource it, that frees you up for other tasks," White said in the September 7 edition of the Kansas City Business Journal.

"Public and private organizations understand that it's inefficient to continuously invest in the training, legal review and documentation needed to properly administer COBRA," Meyers said. "It's considerably more cost-effective to outsource COBRA administration to experts -- particularly now that we're operating in the age of health care reform with a constantly evolving landscape."

California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform

California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a hotly contested pension reform bill whose impact on public employees may signal a new era in DB and health care coverage nationwide.

Reuters notes that Brown's new legislation will raise the minimum retirement ages for many public employees as well as reducing pension benefits for all new workers.

"Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system," Brown said, in a statement. The law, he adds, is the "biggest rollback to public pensions in the history of California pensions."

California's new rules come admit tremendous economic and political pressure to curtail the escalating costs of DB plans and post-retirement benefits for public employees, both in that state and across the U.S.

But California's pressures have been stronger, with several major cities claiming or teetering on the verge of bankrupcy as they find it impossible to meet their pension obligations, in part due to long-term national economic issues.

The state's two biggest pension funds, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, are at least $165 million underfunded.

And normally left-leaning, worker-friendly cities including San Jose and San Diego have also joined the fray, with voters supporting measures to limit pension benefits for existing workers and retirees and drastically reduce services to new hires - votes which are being contested in court by public safety employee unions.

Under Brown's new legistlation, new hires will evenly split payments to their pension accounts with their employers, and other government employers will have more leverage to ask the same of current employees, upping their required contributions. Park rangers, game wardens and firefighters will now have to pay more of their own benefits.

The legislation also launches new formulas for calculating future pension benefits for new employees.

As a spin-off to the pension legislation, Moody's Investors Service said the action will go far to increasing California's overall credit rating, currently listed as A1.

The Associated Press notes that the bill did not include a hybrid-styled system Brown had championed which would add a 401(k)-style system so public employees would bear some of the investment risk, as private-sector workers do.

As well, nothing was done to contain the health care costs promised to retiring workers, and there are still no indendent members with financial experties on the board of the state's main pension fund.

"Yes, it's not everything. It's not perfection," Brown told reporters in Los Angeles. "But in politics we don't deal with perfection. These are hard fought. These aren't that easy."

California's public employees' system estimates the changes will save between $42 billion and $50 billion over 30 years, while the teachers' system estimated its savings at $22.7 billion over 30 years.

Banking, Financial Services; Prudential reports higher rate taxpayers reject (GBP)438 million in tax relief

2012 SEP 8 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News -- One in four higher rate taxpayers do not contribute to pension schemes despite the attraction of tax relief to help boost their retirement savings, according to independent research from Prudential*. Nationally, this equates to around 216,000 employees missing out on up to (GBP)438 million a year in pension tax relief.

The nationwide study of those earning between (GBP)42,275 and (GBP)149,999 found 21 per cent claiming they cannot afford to contribute to a pension scheme. One in eight (13 per cent) say they do not see the point of saving for retirement, despite the tax benefits of pensions, while 17 per cent don't know why they fail to save into a pension scheme.

An average higher rate taxpayer contributing (GBP)425 a month into a pension fund receives basic rate tax relief of (GBP)85 a month or (GBP)1,020 a year, directly into their pension fund. Up to an additional (GBP)1,020 a year in higher rate tax relief can be claimed, which could also be used for pension saving.

Figures from HMRC show that around 58 per cent of the estimated 900,000 higher rate taxpayers in the UK contribute to defined contribution pension schemes, while another 15 per cent are members of either non-contributory or defined benefit schemes.

But despite earning average salaries of (GBP)58,541, the rest do not save into pension schemes at all. Around 43 per cent of those who don't save into a pension scheme claim to have made alternative retirement arrangements, 4 per cent have existing Self-Invested Personal Pension schemes and another 2 per cent claim they will not retire.

Matthew Stephens, Prudential's tax expert, said: "Pension saving offers valuable tax reliefs to all workers and particularly to higher rate taxpayers. Basic rate 20 per cent tax relief is available at source plus up to an extra 20 per cent from HMRC for higher rate taxpayers. Turning down what is effectively free money simply does not make sense.

"It is worrying that so many higher rate taxpayers say they cannot afford to save into a pension despite earning healthy salaries. The good news is that it is never too late to take action on saving for retirement and we urge all workers to seek advice on long-term retirement planning"

The Prudential research shows that recent changes limiting annual tax-free pension contributions to (GBP)50,000 a year have not significantly dented pension saving among higher earners. Just 8 per cent said the change had put them off pension saving while 25 per cent were unaware of the change.

Party conferences promise to turn up the heat on pensions

With MPs back from their holidays soon, pensions will once again become a political battlefield. With the political conference season not far away, here's how I predict pensions will be tackled in the conference halls in Brighton, Birmingham and Manchester.

Auto-enrolment will kick off on 1 October, nestled nicely between the Liberal Democrat and Conservative party conferences. Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb will joke that in this Olympics year the biggest event is yet to begin. He will argue the inclusion of the very smallest and poorest savers is a victory for Lib Dem values against self-interested private sector providers.

Tory chancellor George Osborne will praise auto-enrolment as a fix for Britain's broken savings culture. He will boast about bringing the cost of public sector pensions under control. Hoping to make up for his granny tax blunder, he will announce help for tomorrow's pensioners with a £35,000 cap on long-term care costs.

Silence on state pensions reform

What about what the politicians will not say? I predict they will remain silent on state pensions reform. A coalition policy announcement on this is long overdue.

The Department for Work and Pensions has so far promised a white paper on the £140-a-week flat rate state pension will be published 'later this year'. By staying silent on this, and with auto-enrolment about to begin, the government will expose itself to the accusation it is forcing people to save into pension pots, only to be caught by the current complex and unfair means-testing system.

'I am quite concerned the state pension paper is not appearing,' says Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown. 'Auto-enrolment begins on 1 October, so it needs to be out before then. That is when we will start seeing media awareness and consumer interest increase, so it needs to be put to rest, unless they want people saying their pension will disappear with means-testing.'

Pensions charges concerns

Labour shadow pensions minister Gregg McClymont is likely to take the lead on a pension charges ticket. McClymont wants restrictions removed from the National Employment Savings Trust (Nest) and will no doubt chide the government and private sector over that. He also has the ear of leader Ed Miliband on the issue of 'hidden costs' associated with pension investments.

Independent pensions expert Ros Altmann says the pension charges debate has an 'air of unreality'. For her, the key issue is the massively detrimental effect that quantitative easing (QE) is having on annuity rates. Yet the policy of buying up government bonds is broadly supported by all three parties.

'The great unspoken in all of this is what happens when we take an income and what the government has done to the annuity market through QE,' she says. 'Auto-enrolment savings will not materialise. Modest contributions will not deliver much pension, even with great returns, because annuity rates are so poor.'

Receivers move in on Carroll

ULSTER BANK has appointed receivers to Zelderbridge, a Liam Carroll company with ?985m in bank loans and a deficit of nearly ?600m.

Accounts show the company issued ?27m in unguaranteed loans to Carroll's pension fund and companies controlled by the developer during the property bubble. It is understood that about ?15m of the total went into Carroll's pension pot.

Carroll was one of the most active developers during the building boom, but his empire is being dismantled, with multi-billion-euro debts.

A subsidiary of Zelderbridge made the interest-free payments to Carroll's pension and to businesses he controlled, according to company filings. The loans were issued by Rambridge, an unlimited Irish company that does not have to file publicly available accounts. Its parent company, Wainsford Investments, is incorporated in Jersey.

Zelderbridge is a central company in Carroll's group with more than 60 subsidiaries, including the Dunloe Ewart group, which Carroll acquired in 2002. It also owns the companies behind the Cherrywood Science and Technology Park in south Dublin. The company took in ?20.4m in rent and management fees in 2010 but made a pre-tax loss of ?42m after writing down the value of its properties and paying an interest bill of ?33m. Its property portfolio was valued at ?460m at the end of 2010, less than half the amount it owed the banks.

More than ?200m of Zelderbridge's loans have transferred to the National Asset Management Agency (Nama), and the company has submitted a detailed business plan to the agency.

Zelderbridge has borrowings with several non-Nama banks, including Ulster Bank, KBC, National Irish Bank and Bank of Scotland (Ireland).

Ulster Bank installed Paul McCann and Patrick Dillon of Grant Thornton as receivers at Zelderbridge last week using a charge that had been registered in April. The receivership was necessary to facilitate the sale of a former Carroll building and site at Sir John Rogerson's Quay on the south docks in Dublin.

The eight-storey office block, occupied by financial adviser State Street, and an adjoining three-acre site, were put on the market last week for ?105m. State Street is paying ?7.8m a year in rent under a 25-year lease signed in 2009.

Carroll had planned to build a 100m skyscraper on the adjoining site, which he had acquired through his takeover of Dunloe Ewart. However, work on the project stalled, and Dublin city council refused a time extension for the tower development.

Several other elements of Carroll's empire, including Zoe, are in receivership following moves by other banks. In an interview last week, David Hughes of Ernst & Young, who acts as receiver to Zoe Group for Bank of Scotland (Ireland), said Carroll's properties produced "a very substantial amount of income" and there was "merit" in keeping them together.

Hughes sold two former Carroll properties, Gasworks House and Gordon House, to Google for ?100m last year.

Ownership in 401(k) Plans Continues to Grow

According to a report by the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), at the same time 401(k) plan ownership is rising, ownership of individual retirement accounts (IRAs) is sliding.

In an analysis of the period 2007 to 2010, EBRI found that the share of American families with a member in any employment-based retirement plan from a current employer increased steadily, from 39% in 1992, to 41% in 2007, before declining to 38% in 2010.

Ownership of 401(k)-type plans among families participating in a retirement plan more than doubled, from 32% in 1992, to 79.5% in 2007, and increased again in 2010, to 82%. But the percentage of families owning an IRA or Keogh retirement plan (for the self-employed) declined, from 31% in 2007, to 28% in 2010. In addition, the percentage of families with a retirement plan from a current employer, a previous employer's defined contribution (DC) plan, or an IRA/Keogh declined, from 66% in 2007, to 64% in 2010.

As in the past, EBRI found that retirement plan assets account for a growing percentage of most Americans' financial wealth, not counting the value of their home. The median percentage of families' total financial assets comprised by DC plan assets and/or IRA/Keogh assets (assuming the family had any) increased from 2007 to 2010, and accounted for a clear majority of these assets:

DC plan balances accounted for 58% of families' total financial assets in 2007, and that share grew to 61% in 2010.

DC and/or IRA/Keogh balances increased their share as well, from 64% of total family financial assets in 2007, to 66% in 2010. Across all demographic groups, these assets account for a very large share of total financial assets for those who own these accounts.

However, the EBRI report notes that the most recent data, along with other EBRI research, indicates that few people are likely to afford a comfortable retirement.

"Americans lost a tremendous amount of wealth between 2007 and 2010, and the percentage of families that participated in an employment-based retirement plan and/or owned an IRA decreased as well," said Craig Copeland, EBRI senior research associate and author of the report.

However, he added, the percentage of family heads eligible to participate in a DC plan and actually did so remained virtually unchanged during this time. Therefore, despite all the bad news that resulted from this period, one positive factor should be noted, Copeland said. "Those eligible to participate in a retirement plan continued to participate-which may help change the likelihood of a lower retirement standard for many Americans," he said.

The report is based on the most recent data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), the Federal Reserve Board's triennial survey of wealth. The full report is published in the September EBRI Issue Brief, "Individual Account Retirement Plans: An Analysis of the 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances," available online at www.ebri.org.

For retirees, 70 may not be the new 65

It's become common-and comforting-wisdom: Those who haven't saved enough for retirement can significantly boost their income in their golden years by working until the age of 70, instead of the traditional 65.

Not so, counters a study released Thursday by the Employee Benefit Research Institute. "You're not going to magically be fine if you work a few more years," said Jack VanDerhei, research director for EBRI and author of the report.

EBRI's studies often sound a sobering note on this topic (See our MarketWatch colleague Robert Powell's take on a study from last year: "Many of Us Won't Be Able to Retire Until Our 80s").

Its latest study is noticeably less optimistic than a recent report by another influential research group, the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. The center's report had found that 86% of households would be prepared to retire by age 70. That report also found a relatively small gap between the retirement readiness of low-income and high-income households. But EBRI's report concluded that about a third of today's households wouldn't be financially ready even if they worked to age 70.

VanDerhei said that the Center for Retirement Research analysis didn't factor in the prohibitively high costs of nursing home care, which typically isn't fully covered by Medicare and is only covered by Medicaid in some cases. His own methodology included the probability of nursing home expenses and arrived at a less optimistic conclusion.

It also projected a much bigger gap between rich and poor: While 90% of those making at least $72,500 in annual income would have a 50% chance of meeting their retirement income needs by age 65, those making $11,700 and below would need to work until 84 to have the same probability of success.

Neither study specifically defines the percentage of working income that a retiree would need to replace to be considered adequately prepared. (In an email, Andrew D. Eschtruth, communications director for the Center for Retirement Research, says, "Different methodologies will produce different results, but both studies agree that working longer will help improve retirement security.")

Many workers don't even have the luxury of delaying retirement. In EBRI's 2012 Retirement Confidence Survey, 50% of current retirees reported they left the workforce earlier than planned-because of health concerns for themselves or their spouse, changes at their company or other reasons. The bottom line for workers? "Bite the bullet and save the additional money," VanDerhei said.

EBRI's findings weren't all bleak, however: The study found that workers who participated in a 401(k) plan at age 65 boosted their retirement readiness by 20 percentage points.

If you haven't saved enough for retirement, working a few more years won't magically improve your security. But workers who participate in a 401(k) plan boost their retirement readiness substantially.|103

Buyers still in the box seat

THE signs may be pointing to gloom, but for homebuyers there may not be a better time to strike.

The Commonwealth Bank Home Buyers Index, compiled with RP Data, shows there are five regions of Melbourne considered buyers' markets compared with one that is a sellers' market. The index is based on the ratio of properties available for sale compared with demand for Commonwealth Bank home loans, to identify hot spots for buyers and sellers across Australia.

Eastern middle Melbourne, Greater Dandenong, inner Melbourne, Boroondara and Mornington Peninsula are buyer hot spots, while northern outer Melbourne is best for sellers.

RP Data research director Tim Lawless said the fourth index had seen subtle improvements, ``however the housing market still favours the buyer''.

``Our data is showing stock levels remain high across each of the capital cities, so prospective buyers have a good range of housing options to choose from,'' Mr Lawless said.

CALL TO USE SUPER CASH FOR HOUSE DEPOSIT

A LEADING mortgage broker has called on the Federal Government to change the rules governing compulsory superannuation so Australians can use their super for a first-home deposit.

1300HomeLoan managing director John Kolenda said rules could be modelled on the successful Singaporean system which has lifted home ownership there to 90 per cent of people compared with 66 per cent in Australia.

``At the moment we are making it harder than it needs to be for first-home buyers to get a roof over their heads because we are forcing them to save 9 per cent of their income for super before they can even start saving money for a home deposit,'' Mr Kolenda said.

``It is ridiculous to make someone who is just starting out in life save for their retirement before they have even secured a home, especially when you consider that owning your own home is one of the greatest protections against poverty in old age anyway.''

RECONFIGURATION ADDS MORE APARTMENTS

STRONG buyer demand has prompted the developers of Local Carlton to reconfigure its project to add five three-bedroom apartments and 12 one-bedroom apartments.

Developer Living Carlton Consortium, a joint venture between Australand Property Group and Citta Property Group, is setting its sights on young families wanting an affordable three-bedroom living option in the heart of the inner-city.

``Our three-bedroom apartments offer an affordable alternative for those buyers being priced out of the Carlton house market,'' said Australand's Sarah Bloom.

``Local Carlton is also attracting interest from young families who currently live in the suburbs and want to cut down their commute time.''

The development's three-bedroom apartments are priced from $645,000.

``Apart from penthouses, which typically sell for more than $800,000, most residential apartment developments offer less than 4 per cent of their total configurations as three bedrooms,'' Ms Bloom said.

``Our move to incorporate more options into our apartment mix has already proven very popular with young families.''

Speed trading threatens Terminator event

The buying and selling of shares by computers has frightening implications, writes David Potts.

'Dark pools" sounds like something particles whizzing around the Hadron Collider at almost the speed of light might find.

If only. Fact is they are a by-product of something more sinister: speed trading, where computers initiate, uh interface, share trades with each other so fast that if you blink you've missed 150 of them.

If it's possible to travel faster than the speed of light, these computers will be the first to know.

Not that they'll tell anybody. The problem with speed trading is nobody, least of all the ASX or Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), knows what the computers are up to.

There's no human intervention, apart from the design of the algorithms in the first place. From there, the computers are on their own and can run rampant with a faulty algorithm until somebody pulls the plug, invariably too late.

Remember the "flash crash" two years ago, when Wall Street dropped 1000 points in 20 minutes? Speed trading. Even scarier, it's spread to commodities and, gulp, derivatives, bringing wild price fluctuations with it.

A Wall Street trader, Knight Capital Group, recently blew $440 million in an hour as its computer went haywire - distorting the prices of 150 stocks in the process - and nearly went under.

And what if it had? Good riddance you say - only that could have been another Lehman moment. It was the collapse of the non-collapsible Lehman Brothers that pushed the global financial system to the brink.

Yet speed trading is encouraged by the ASX, which happens to earn a fee for every quote, so a few more million sure won't hurt it.

Trouble is, the computers are trading with each other for starters.

Besides, the computer programs vault to the top of the queue because they know your order before the ASX's computer does and, the way things are going, I dare say even you. They'll undercut a seller and overbid a buyer to get in first. Cripes, they can beat you even at the same price.

Or they're flooding the market with fake bids, suggesting something's happening and there's momentum, only to cancel them a nanosecond before the market opens. That's called manipulation and would land a broker who tried it in jail.

This is pushing more trades off the exchange into dark pools owned by banks and brokers, which has the ASX whingeing to ASIC.

Still, it says dark pools are the antithesis of what a sharemarket should be about - transparency and a level playing field. While ASIC and ASX are sending papers to each other on how to control dark pools, the cause of them - speed trading - is accelerating, so to speak.

What scares me is that they've already lost control and don't even realise it.

Expectations unrealistic about retirement

Young Canadians have unrealistic expectations about retirement, a new report suggests.

Younger people are the least likely to put money away for retirement, according to a Bank of Montreal survey, "because in all probability, their retirement date is the furthest away." Despite this, they have "overly optimistic" goals of retiring early.

Almost half (41%) of Canadians between 18 and 35 plan to retire before they turn 60, while 57% say they'll stop working between 60 and 69. Boomers over 55, however, don't have such lofty expectations: Only 8% expect to call it quits by 60.

"The fact that younger adults are the least prepared ... should not be overlooked. Logically speaking, the earlier individuals start to save for retirement, the greater the potential for ensuring future financial security," the BMO report said.

They key to tackling this problem is to change young people's attitudes about retirement, BMO suggests. While 82% of adults under 35 agreed that retirement planning is important, and 52% have some savings in an RRSP, very few actually think about retirement in detail.

Just 10% said they thought a lot about how much money they need to save. Fewer than 5% had thought about how long their retirement might last.

"In the absence of visualizing one's retirement, it is impossible to accurately forecast the amount of money that might be required, and for how long. Not knowing these details may be an indication that a person does not have a strong attitude towards retirement," the study's authors noted.

"Judging by the low financial preparedness scores found by the research, their future prosperity may be currently at risk. It is important to help this younger generation -- and soon -- as it is clear that the earlier they start to save for retirement, the more financial security they are likely to have in the long run."

The results are based on a sample of 1,000 Canadians polled in February by Leger Marketing. The margin of error is 3.1%, 19 times out of 20.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) is clamping down on how packaged bank accountsare sold to prevent customers from "throwing money down the drain".

Packaged accounts, where customers pay a monthly fee for their account in return for freebies and perks, are big money spinners for banks. Extras thrown in alongside a current account typically include travel insurance, breakdown cover, mobile phone insurance and discounts on overdraft fees.

But fees for such perks can cost up to £300 year and the FSA is concerned that many of the extras offered are unsuitable for customers.

The regulator has now published new rules that will force banks and building societies to check whether customers are eligible to claim on insurance cover before selling them a packaged bank account and alert them if some are not.

Sheila Nicoll, FSA director of policy, said: "These products are often referred to as upgraded accounts but if you end up paying for an element you can't claim on, it's money down the drain. We are closely monitoring the promotion of packaged bank accounts and the new rules will make sure customers know what they're buying and that they can rely on the product or have the limitations explained before buying."

The number of people holding packaged bank accounts has doubled over the past five years. According to figures from data analysts, Defaqto, there are currently 70 different types of packaged accounts on sale in the UK, compared with 39 in 2007.

The Financial Ombudsman Service said it receives about 150 complaints each year linked to the accounts but it added that the overall number is likely to be "significantly" higher as most complaints are linked to insurance policies sold as part of the account. Many customers have found they are ineligible to claim on parts of the packages such as travel insurance.

Of Britain's largest banks, Barclays and Lloyds Banking Group refused to say how many of its customers use paid-for accounts.

The largely state owned Royal Bank of Scotland said 2.5 million customers held packaged accounts, while HSBC said 840,000 of its customers held such accounts. Elsewhere, the Co-operative Bank said it now had 210,00 customers using packaged accounts, while Santander UK said that it had 300,000 customers on paid-for accounts.

All banks said they were taking steps to ensure suitable customers took out packaged accounts and had co-operated with the FSA investigation.

Michael Ossei, personal finance expert at uSwitch.com, said: "This is good news for consumers as it brings some much-needed clarity into the paid-for current account market. For too long, banks have been signing up customers to these fee-paying accounts with little evidence to suggest that the customer actually requires or can even use the benefits that they are paying for."

Divorce hits female finances: study

Divorce hits female finances: study

By Rachel Wells

Women's household incomes suffer more than men after divorce, but it takes men longer to recover emotionally, a new study has found. The joint research, led by the Australian Institute of Family Studies, also highlights the significant impact divorce has on the financial assets of divorcees, which leads to many requiring greater government support in later life. The research - to be presented at the AIFS conference in Melbourne

later this week - shows the household income after divorce declined for women, but not for men. In fact, while women's household income dropped significantly, particularly in the first year after divorce, males' income continued to rise. While the research showed some women were able to return to their pre-divorce income after six years, through re-partnering, increased labour force participation and government benefits, this was not the case for divorced women with dependent children.

The report - based on data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia study - also showed that divorced men and women have fewer household assets than their married and never married counterparts. While the assets of those who divorce are $180,000 to $190,000 less than non-divorced people, even before divorce, the gap doubles to $360,000 to $390,000, six years after divorce. AIFS senior research fellow Lixia Qu said for divorcees who did not re-partner, a lack of assets could

lead to a greater reliance on government benefits. ''Divorce has a big impact on both men and women whose assets continue to fall behind married households and this impacts significantly on retirement income for divorced men and women who remained single, making them more reliant on government support to get by,'' she said. Melbourne mother-of-two, Isabella Mammoliti, who was forced to return to work after her divorce in 2007, says it is not just the immediate

financial burden of being a single parent that causes her ''distress'', but the long-term financial impact. ''My biggest worry is that I hadn't worked for over seven years and that's going to affect my superannuation in the future ... I've also had to sell the family home which has not only had an emotional impact on the children but will have a long-term financial impact.'' The study - which also looked at the emotional wellbeing of divorcees - revealed that men reported greater feelings of isolation and loneliness

than women, even up to six years after divorce. After two years of divorce, 24 per cent of men said they felt isolated, compared to 12 per cent of women. After six years, more men (19 per cent) than women (12 per cent) still reported feelings of isolation. Meanwhile, 35 per cent of men reported feeling ''very lonely'' two years after divorce, compared to 25 per cent of women. and after six years, 26 per cent of men still reported loneliness compared with 20 per cent of women.

Report Details Woes of Student Loan Debt

As in the housing market, securitization of student loans led to more aggressive underwriting for borrowers who could not possibly afford the debt they took on, according to a government report.

The 131-page report was formally released by the Education Department and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau on Friday. It provides new estimates for total outstanding student loan debt: more than $1 trillion in 2011, composed of $864 billion in federal government loans and $150 billion in private student loan debt.

Cumulative defaults on private student loans exceeded $8 billion, a sum from over 850,000 distinct loans.

That total has risen in the last decade as lenders bypassed college financial aid offices and marketed loans directly to students. Students often signed on without realizing the difference between private and government loans or that government loans usually offered better terms, the report says.

Private student loans, for example, usually charge higher interest rates and are harder to discharge in bankruptcy.

In addition, many lenders lowered their underwriting standards so that they could originate and then sell off more loans, even if the loans were based on terms the borrowers could not possibly fulfill. Defaults became even more inevitable after the recession slashed graduates' job possibilities.

"Subprime-style lending went to college and now students are paying the price," the education secretary, Arne Duncan, said. "We still have some work to do to ensure that students who take out private student loans have the same kinds of protections offered by federal loans. In the meantime, if you have to take out a loan to pay for college, federal student aid should be your first option."

In a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Mr. Duncan and Richard Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, described ways in which private lenders might have misled borrowers or failed to be entirely transparent about their borrowing terms.

The government officials said they are not currently pursuing action against lenders for these past lending practices, but are monitoring the market now under authority granted by the Dodd-Frank financial regulation legislation. They have also urged Congress to reconsider the treatment of private loans in bankruptcies and to require more disclosure in the loan application process.

Private lenders have already tightened their credit standards after the torrent of defaults in several ways, like requiring student loans to be co-signed. In 2008, 67 percent of private student loans were co-signed; as of 2011, more than 90 percent were.

Mr. Duncan also offered a checklist of tasks that students should complete to make more conscientious decisions about financing college.

These include applying to more than one school and filling out a financial aid form for each school. The vast majority of students who fill out federal student financial aid forms do so for only one school, he said, and so do not have an opportunity to compare the value they could get from different schools.

Why Investors Should Skip Top Dividend-Yielders; Hough: Investors should be careful about reaching too high for yield.

Income investing used to be easy. A retiree who plunked $1 million into 10-year Treasury notes during the past half century locked in, on average, a yearly income of around $67,000. But with interest rates at record lows, that same investment recently paid less than $15,000 a year.

Some investors are looking to stocks with high dividend yields to recoup this lost income. Standard & Poor's 500-stock index yields 2.2 percent, but its top 50 stocks, by dividend, yield an average of 5.5 percent. That's enough to turn that $1 million into $55,000 in yearly income.

Be careful about reaching too high for yield, however. Income investors are better off skipping those top 50 high-yielders and looking instead to the 50 that are just below them, whose yields average 3.8 percent.

Here are three reasons: First, high-yielders were stars last year but have been slipping of late. The S&P's top 50 yielders returned a whopping 18.5 percent in 2011, beating the 2.1 percent total return for the broad index as well as the total returns for more than 30 stock-picking strategies tracked by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. But so far this year, high-yielders have performed near the bottom of the pack.

Second, because dividend yields rise as share prices fall, the highest yields are often attached to troubled firms. Investors who give up a little yield can get a lot more safety -- and they may not even have to settle for lower total returns. For example, among the top 50 S&P members by dividend yield, the median paid more than 80 percent of its earnings as dividends over the past year, compared with 53 percent in the next 50. The higher that number, the greater the risk of a dividend cut if earnings dip. Also, the top 50 yielders' dividends grew by a median rate of just 2 percent during the past year, compared with 10 percent for the 50 below them. Dividend growth can lead to higher share prices, which boost total returns. According to Bank of America, both groups have generated handsome average returns of more than 16 percent in rolling 12-month periods since 1984 -- but the top group has lost money more often.

The third reason: The dividend tax is capped at 15 percent; but the cap expires at the end of this year, and without action from Congress, the rate for high-income investors could more than double. That could lead to a short-term sell-off in high-yield stocks.

The stocks below come from the S&P 500's second-highest-yielding group of 50. Each firm has manageable debt and affordable dividends, and each recently boosted its payment -- as good a sign as any that management sees healthy profits ahead.

WSJ: U.S. Chief Justice Roberts Surprises With Ruling on Health-Care Law

The pivotal--and most surprising--vote to uphold most of the Obama administration's health-care law came from Supreme Court Chief Justice John G. Roberts, in a move that is likely to be celebrated by the political left and derided by those on the right.

The chief justice was expected by many legal experts to vote alongside the conservative bloc and shoot down the law but instead he cast a crucial fifth vote with the liberal side.

Legal experts described the unexpected move as much more than a vote about the health-care law. Rather, some saw it as a carefully calibrated move designed to shore up the court's popular reputation in an election year and to provide a potential road map for conservatives looking to challenge other federal laws in court.

"It was a brilliant stroke," said Brad Joondeph, a constitutional law professor at Santa Clara University. By upholding the law, the Chief Justice steered the court "clear of appearing partisan."

But Chief Justice Roberts also made sure to keep the broader impact of his decision narrow, by saying explicitly that the Affordable Care Act survived only if viewed as a tax and that, had Congress had to rely on the Commerce Clause to pass the law, the law would have failed.

"Congress has never attempted to rely on that power to compel individuals not engaged in commerce to purchase an unwanted product," wrote Chief Justice Roberts. "If the power to 'regulate' something included the power to create it, many of the provisions in the Constitution would be superfluous."

Legal experts suspect that this language could be seized upon in the future by conservatives or others looking to strike down existing--and in some instances longstanding--federal laws regulating everything from the environment to consumer safety. Many of those laws were passed under the Commerce Clause.

"Make no mistake, Roberts gave the conservatives a very big gift--a ticking time bomb that could explode in cases down the line," said Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice, a liberal-leaning civil-rights organization in Washington. "The Commerce Clause undergirds the entire fabric of government and a lot of our laws."

Since Barack Obama became president, his political fate has been shaped to an unusual degree by decisions made by a court led by Chief Justice Roberts.

One of the first bills signed by the president overturned a pay-discrimination case decided by the Roberts court.

For more than a year, the president and his top aides have said his re-election chances have been undermined by a 2010 decision from the Roberts court that loosened campaign-finance laws and sparked a surge of independent political fundraising, much of it on the right.

Chief Justice Roberts was in the majority and wrote a concurring opinion in the case known as Citizens United.

Insurance clarified for departing UTB faculty

June 15--Because faculty members who opt to separate from UTB next May will receive nine-month contracts for the coming academic year, their health insurance coverage also will end in May, officials confirmed this week.

As required by federal law, such faculty may continue coverage for a time, at their own expense, through the COBRA program.

The University of Texas at Brownsville is proceeding with a reduction in force because of the end of its partnership with Texas Southmost College.

For faculty who leave UTB and end up joining TSC in the fall of 2013, it would leave a three-month gap in health insurance that they would have to pay for themselves.

Faculty who choose to participate in the "separation" program -- which offers a $15,000 payment for the voluntary resignation of tenured faculty -- are expected to deliver their signed agreement to the provost's office in July.

At last count from UTB officials, 88 faculty positions will be terminated next May 31. This August, final notices are expected to be sent to faculty members who are affected.

On Thursday, UTB transition official Michael Putegnat confirmed that the end of faculty health insurance at that time is a cost-saving measure.

"For those faculty members who will be separating at the end of May in 2013, they will be paid their full year's salary in nine monthly payments, the last of which will be for May," he said. "They will have no summer payments from which to deduct their health insurance premiums, nor will they be employees, so their employer will not be paying the premium either."

COBRA provides for continuing coverage.

"UTB cannot afford to pay the full insurance premium for the separating employees over the summer, but those leaving do qualify for COBRA, which allows them to continue their insurance for a time if they choose to and make the premium payments," Putegnat said.

UTB provided the following information regarding monthly rates for the UT Select Medical and prescription plan for fiscal year 2012:

Employee only: $468.39

Employee and spouse: $918.56

Employee and children: $838.35

Employee and family: $1,274.95

In related separation matters, Putegnat confirmed UTB will retain eight faculty members who were formerly master technical instructors, a unique position created for the UTB-TSC partnership. He said they will teach in the following areas: accounting and management information systems, allied health, behavior sciences, biological sciences, computer and information sciences, and English.

Master technical instructors were teachers without terminal degrees, meaning they may not have the highest degree offered in their field or their field may not have an advanced degree. UT System amended its rule about master technical instructors last year, effectively ending such a faculty position.

HIPAA Criminal Penalties - Defendant May Be Found Guilty without "Knowledge" That Acts Are Illegal

Individuals who access protected health information without authorization may be found guilty of a misdemeanor even if they lack knowledge that their actions are illegal.

On May 10, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a United States District Court information that charged Huping Zhou, a former research assistant at the University of California at Los Angeles Health System ("UHS"), with violating Section 1320d-6 (the "Wrongful Disclosure Section") of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The section provides that any person who "knowingly and in violation of this part...obtains individually identifiable health information relating to an individual" is subject to a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $50,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than one year.

Zhou was charged under subsection (a)(2) of the Wrongful Disclosure Section for "knowingly" accessing patients' medical records with no permitted justification after he was terminated from UHS for performance-related reasons. According to a 2010 statement, Zhou illegally accessed patient records 323 times during a three-week period, including those of his immediate supervisor, co-workers, and well-known celebrities. Zhou admitted in his plea agreement to accessing patient records on four specific occasions after his termination. Zhou was the first individual convicted of, and incarcerated for, misdemeanor HIPAA offenses for accessing confidential patient records without a valid reason or authorization.

On appeal, Zhou argued that a defendant cannot be guilty of violating HIPAA if he did not know that obtaining the protected health information was illegal. The court rejected his argument, finding that it "contradicts the plain language of HIPAA." The court held that the word "and" clearly provides that there are two elements of a Wrongful Disclosure Section violation: 1) knowingly obtaining individually identifiable health information relating to an individual; and 2) obtaining that information in violation of HIPAA.

The court stated that "the term 'knowingly' applies only to the act of obtaining the health information" and that the defendant need only know that he obtained individually identifiable health information relating to an individual in order to be found guilty of violating the statute.

Every provider must develop and implement policies designed to ensure that terminated employees cannot access the provider's systems, including those with protected health information. Referencing this case in the course of employee training will further drive the point home and reinforce the importance of preventing the unauthorized access of protected health information.

Manchin: We Must Come Together To Keep Student Loans Affordable - Sen. Joe, III Manchin (D-WV) News Release

Office of Sen. Joe, III Manchin (D-WV) News Release

Washington, D.C. - U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) issued the following statement about votes today on keeping student loan rates affordable.

"The fact is that keeping student loan rates low should be one of the highest priorities for this country, because we must invest in the next generation," Senator Manchin said. "As Democrats and Republicans, we must come together and agree on a way to keep student loans affordable.

"For the people of West Virginia, it's only fair to fund these student loans by ending loopholes in our tax system - like the John Edwards/Newt Gingrich loophole that allows some to avoid paying their Medicare taxes. Unfortunately, a second measure would have taken the wrong approach, by eliminating funding for preventive health care, which is so important to our communities in West Virginia.

"Affordable student loan rates should not be a partisan issue, and I am determined to make sure that the federal government will be a good partner for the young people of this country who are taking out loans to invest in their education."

Background:

According to the Project on Student Debt, West Virginia's students have an average of $23,678 in student debt.

About 73 percent of students in West Virginia have student loan debt.

According to the Department of Education, more than 60 percent of college students get a federal student loan at some point in their undergraduate studies. Subsidized Stafford loans will account for more than one-quarter of the total federal student loan volume next year.

Senator Manchin supported S. 2343, the Stop the Student Loan Interest Rate Hike Act of 2012, which would extend the current 3.4% interest rate on federally subsidized Stafford student loans for one year. The cost of the bill is offset by requiring those with incomes over $250,000 to include, for purposes of employment taxes, income received from an S-corp.

Senator Manchin voted against S. 2366, the Interest Rate Reduction Act, which also extends the current 3.4% interest rate for one year. The cost of the bill is offset by repealing the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which provides grant assistance to states and other entities for prevention, wellness, and other public health-related programs. West Virginia has been awarded $9.9 million in Prevention Fund grants.

Subsidized Stafford student loans are awarded based on financial need. The federal government pays the interest on Subsidized loans while the student is in school, during the grace period, and during authorized deferment. About 70 percent of students who qualify for subsidized loans have a family income of less than $50,000. The Department of Education estimates that about 30 percent of undergraduates have this type of loan.

BP's cash balance plan offers flexibility, value

In 1989, BP America Inc. converted its existing final average pay pension plan to a cash balance plan, becoming one of the first major employers to adopt what was then a still relatively new plan design.

More than 20 years after BP made the switch, the appeal of the plan remains powerful, says Rick Dorazil, BP's vp-total reward, Western Hemisphere.

"One doesn't have to wait until the end of his or her career to build a significant balance, as is the case with a final average pay plan. Cash balance plans provide a more even accrual of benefits," Mr. Dorazil said.

That steadier buildup of benefits means employees can earn a significant benefit after just a few years of service, Mr. Dorazil said, an advantage as the workforce becomes more mobile.

And since the benefit is expressed as a lump sum, it is highly visible and thus appreciated by plan participants, he said. "I can see my vested balance. I know what I am going to walk away with," Mr. Dorazil said.

Many other employers, though, have frozen defined benefit plans, including cash balance plans. Indeed, a Towers Watson & Co. analysis published last year found that 40% of Fortune 1000 companies with defined benefit plans had frozen at least one of those plans, up from just over 7% as recently as 2004.

But BP is sticking with its cash balance plan for several reasons. Pragmatically, BP's major competitors still offer pension plans. But just as important, BP's pension plan is highly valued by both new and veteran employees, Mr. Dorazil said.

And the time may come when employers may be at a competitive disadvantage if they do not offer a pension plan, he said.

"The under-age-35 population is starting to connect the dots. They understand that with a 401(k) plan, all the investment risk is on them," he said. And that younger generation saw the consequences of that risk during the economic downturn that began in 2008, when the value of many employees' 401(k) account balances plunged along with the stock market, he said.

"They (younger employees) saw what happened to their parents," Mr. Dorazil said.

Unlike many other employers, BP's cash balance plan is fully funded, Mr. Dorazil said. Recently, the company moved to an investment strategy in which more plan assets are invested in bonds and other fixed income investments, and less in equities.

That shift has reduced investment volatility, with the maturity of fixed income investments linked to meeting the plan's cash needs to pay benefits.

Under the plan, employees receive pay-related credits. In addition, they also receive interest credits. Interest on employees' account balances is tied to the interest rate on 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds, with a minimum annual 5% interest credit.

"If managed correctly, a cash balance plan will provide tremendous value to employees, while providing funding flexibility for the company," Mr. Dorazil said.

Transamerica Retirement Services Corporation; Transamerica Retirement Services Introduces PortfolioXpress, a Customized Asset Allocation Service for Retirement Plan Participants

2012 MAY 12 - (VerticalNews.com) -- Transamerica Retirement Services announced the launch of PortfolioXpress,(R) a new asset allocation service designed to make saving for retirement easier for participants in company-sponsored retirement plans. PortfolioXpress uses the plan's core investment line-up to build a series of model portfolios along a glide path that is based on the participant's retirement date. The glide path shifts from a more aggressive investment approach to a more conservative approach as the participant nears retirement, and is automatically rebalanced over time. Plan sponsors can choose a glide path that goes to the expected retirement date or a glide path that continues through retirement.

"Transamerica is committed to making saving for retirement easier," said Stig Nybo, president of Transamerica Retirement Services. "PortfolioXpress makes it easier for plan participants to save by automatically allocating the participant's savings in the plan's investments based on the participant's chosen retirement date.

Double whammy

The European sword of Damocles in the guise of Solvency II and gender- neutral annuity pricing has been hanging over the annuity market for some time and will come to a head at the end of 2012.

Solvency II is a complex piece of EU regulation that will result in life companies setting aside more capital to support their future liabilities. If annuity companies have to put more capital aside to finance their annuities,it will inevitably result in lower incomes. This is one of the reasons why Prudential is considering moving its HQ overseas.

However, there was some good news from Europe recently when a very technical announcement has been interpreted as meaning that the nightmare of a 10 to 20 per cent cut in rates now appears unlikely. Solvency II may have a negative effect on annuity rates but not as bad as many expected.

Gender-neutral annuity pricing means exactly that. The rates for men and women will be the same despite the obvious difference in life expectancy. It is hard to see who will benefit except for single ladies as married ladies will lose out from the lower income from joint life annuities.

With annuity rates at such low levels, some commentators think we are approaching the time when guarantee annuity rates can no longer be thought of as the default option at retirement for those with above average funds.

I think this is a very interesting point and I do think we have reached that stage already.

To be clear, those with below- average sized pension funds and who have no other sources of income or capital will probably find that guaranteed annuities are the right investment for them. From an advice point of view, these clients should not take undue risk with their pension funds. Also, inflation may not be a big issue as the state pension makes up a significant part of their pension and this will increase each year.

However, for those with above average pension funds, the alternatives such as investment-linked annuities, fixed income plans and drawdown will be viable alternatives to guaranteed annuities.

I have recently been looking at the benefits of advice for customers and one of the themes is that advice should be future-proof. By that I mean a client should be satisfied that their income needs will be met. So if both inflation and interest rates rose significantly in the future, their annuity income should be protected from inflation while also benefiting from any increase in interest rates. A guaranteed annuity clearly does not do this.

In conclusion, annuity rates have reached the bottom of the current cycle and we may see some very small increases until the double whammy of Solvency II and gender-neutral pricing kick in at the end of the year. I also see an increase in demand for advice as individual circumstances become more complex. 'We may see some very small increases until Solvency II and gender-neutral pricing kick in

What's fair share when it's your nest egg?

THE old shares versus cash debate has risen again and, as with anything to do with money, especially our superannuation hip pockets, it's an emotional issue.

Four years after the global financial crisis, many people are still feeling burnt by the share market. Most Australian super funds have not recovered all their losses and many never will.

Even when they do get back to ``ground zero'' and their balances and contributions are back up to full whack, many will still have lost years of investment growth that we would otherwise have earned during the recovery period.

No wonder shares versus cash is a touchy subject.

But the heart of the debate is quite simple: compared with most of the developed world, Australian superannuation funds have a larger amount of money riding on the share market.

About 50 per cent of our super money -- $650 billion -- is at the mercy of the roller-coaster share market every day. A 1 per cent fall, means $6.5 billion instantly wiped off.

But, of course, a 1 per cent increase means an extra $6.5 billion in the nest egg -- and that's the lure of the share market.

So, what does it mean when some people say we have too much money in the share market compared with other countries -- 40 per cent in Canada and about 30 per cent in Japan.

Is it a deliberate strategy by Australian trustees and fund managers, or is it lazy or convenient that we have a higher percentage in shares?

Where should the money be invested? Is the Australian corporate and government bond market safe and liquid enough?

And how much is too much, anyway?

While, yes, compared with other countries, Aussie super funds are overweight in shares but as a nation we are also heavily overweight in residential property.

We are big-time property owners, while the rest of the world are big-time property renters. Should we scale back our home ownership?

Regardless of which side of the fence you stand on, the answer is not the most important part of the debate. What matters is that it gets us all thinking about our own super and how we want it invested.

It's fine for the boffins and academics to debate the theory of shares versus bonds, but what's right for a 30-year-old single is not going to be the same as a 40-year-old family man or a 70-year-old widow.

Superannuation is not a one-size-fits-all option.

We must take responsibility and make our own decisions about where to invest our money.

After all, you wouldn't hand over $100,000 to a real estate agent and say put it on deposit for any property, anywhere. So why would you hand over $100,000 to a fund manager and say do anything you want with it?

Millions of public sector pensioners lose fight to escapean equity of misery

Tuesday, Narch 20: Posted by Ian Cowie

Comment on this at telegraph.co.uk/blogs

Public sector pensioners are entitled to resent a ruling by the Court of Appeal on indexlinking because it will almost certainly reduce the real value or purchasing power of their pensions in retirement.

The Government is undoubtedly guilty of doubledealing in the different ways it measures inflation. It uses the higher retail prices index (RPI) to determine rail fare increases and how much interest graduates must pay on their debts. Then it switches to the lower consumer prices index (CPI) to calculate how much compensation state pensioners and other people living on fixed incomes require for the way quantitative easing and negative real interest rates are shrinking the pounds in their pockets.

Indexation was originally intended to preserve the real value of pensions against insidious erosion by inflation. While many utilities and basic foods are seeing double-digit price increases, it is difficult to see how CPI will achieve that aim. If it continues to fall short of the real cost of living, perhaps it will come to be known as the cutting pensions index.

But it will narrow the gap between private sector and public sector retirement provision; 95pc of savers in the private sector with defined contribution pensions cannot afford any form of inflation protection at all.

So today's decision goes some way to imposing an equality of misery on private and public sector pensioners. But the latter still have a good deal for which to be grateful: pensions that most of their counterparts outside the government payroll could never afford.

You said

I am sick of people berating the pensions of nurses/teachers etc.

All of us should have decent pensions but oh no ? let's berate the public sector so we all get NO pensions.

bella 21/03/2012 at 12.09

This effect is a consequence of too much government spending, for any and all reasons, and the natural increase in inflation.

ryck 21/03/2012 at 06.07

The fact that inflation on some items of expenditure is higher than CPI is neither here nor there. Life goes round and one must take the rough with the smooth (that includes me). When the country is broke, we have to accept some reduction in our generally reasonable lifestyle.

davidofkent 20/03/2012 at 03:24

Sounds like a very just judgment, one that will help those who have to work hard to pay for the pensions of others, though it would be far better for the UK economy if a cut in those pensions, which come on top of the state pension, were engineered.

nettle 20/03/2012 at 01.49

Roll on the next election when we pensioners will be voting ? Me, I'm voting Ukip 'cos it's a slap for Camerloon and the Clegg person.

U.S. to turn into major oil-products exporter: report; Huge impact on Canada

Changes are afoot in the global energy sector with the United States set to reprise its role as a major producer and exporter of fossil fuels. But these changes would have a profound impact on its energy trade with Canada, especially in the natural-gas sector, according to a report released Tuesday.

From a perpetually hungry energy consumer, the U.S. will turn into a major exporter of coal, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and oil products within the next 20 years, the report says.

"Between reduced oil imports, and the rise of China, the U.S. is starting to assume a more sophisticated role - a role where the U.S. could export over 500 million tonnes of coal, 3.2 billion cubic feet per day of LNG and possibly over 2.5 million barrels per day of oil products by 2030," said Wood Mackenzie, an energy research consultancy, in a study.

The U.S. is set to become a net LNG exporter by 2016 with piped gas exports to Mexico reaching 1.8 bcfd. To put that into perspective, the last time the U.S. was a net exporter of gas was in 1957.

U.S. net oil imports will be 3.3 mil-lion b/d less than in 2010 on the back of greater vehicle fuel efficiencies and changing consumer habits.

"The position of the U.S. as a net exporter of oil products has arisen during a time in which demand has dropped by almost 1.9 million bpd from its peak in 2005, with 2011 demand being approximately 150,000 below 2010 levels," said Alan Gelder, Head of Oil Research for Wood Mackenzie.

Strong supply growth from key tight-oil plays in the U.S., shown by the structural shift in the Brent-WTI differential, is supporting the emergence of the U.S. as a growing net exporter of oil products, according to the consultancy.

However, the U.S. shale-gas boom would decrease U.S. dependence on Canadian gas. Wood Mackenzie expects Canada's net exports to the U.S. to be almost 30% lower in 2030, compared with the peak reached in 2002.

This is partly due to U.S. self-sufficiency in natural gas, but also due to Canada's rising gas needs, which will exceed production.

"Canadian demand will increase by almost 60% from 2010 to 2030 while production will only increase by 40% over the same time frame," the report notes.

Canadian natural-gas demand will be driven by oil sands production, which is forecast to require 2.1 bcfd of additional gas to match its rising oputput by 2030.

"As the U.S. adjusts to its new role, only one thing is certain. The supply/demand fundamentals of the second-largest energy consumer are changing, and this will have untold consequences on an increasingly global energy market," the report concludes.

GiftCard Partners creates paths for employers and institutions to lower healthcare costs 
 

WELLESLEY, Mass., Feb. 22, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Today GiftCard Partners (GCP) announced its highest rate of growth in their company history. Although GCP made several advancements in their loyalty and fundraising channels and several of their employee incentives categories; they largely attribute their employee and revenue growth to their recognition as a leader in health and wellness program incentives. GCP's CVS/pharmacy, CVS Select(R), SUBWAY(R), and Nutrisystem(R) gift cards, combined with their research and editorials on corporate and institutional health and wellness, yielded unprecedented sales results in 2011 and the start of 2012.

GCP understood early on, the role that health and wellness programs would play in the current political landscape, in America's corporations, small to medium sized businesses, and healthcare institutions like Medicaid and Medicare. "The constant rise of healthcare costs, health benefits costs to companies, increasing employee benefits contributions, combined with recent healthcare reforms, have catapulted health and wellness programs to a top priority for 2012," says Deborah Merkin, GCP's CEO. "We are pleased to see a rise in interest amongst HR professionals and the publications they count on. They are seeking our research, editorials and blogs on how our customers and constituents are setting up and benefiting from their health and wellness programs."

This month, Voluntary Benefits Magazine published "Start a Health and Wellness Program in 2012 - 5 Compelling Reasons Why to Start Now", an editorial that highlights GCP's innovation in the health and wellness arena and addresses employers' chief concerns, like: what to expect from their program, how to overcome participation obstacles, how to measure results, and key concepts on "what most employers don't get right".

"We are very proud of our advancements in the health and wellness incentives marketplace and we continue to forge new paths, like with Medicare and Medicaid programs, to incentivize patients to maintain routine well-visits, reach wellness milestones, and live an overall healthier lifestyle," says Merkin, "and we look forward to our customers creating a healthier 2012 and beyond."

Grubb Still Seeks Financing in Absence of BGC Deal

REAL ESTATE: Brokerage had been in exclusive talks

Grubb & Ellis Co. is still on the lookout for a buyer or investor, after the struggling Santa Ana-based commercial real estate brokerage was unable to reach a deal with another potential white knight last month.

Grubb has been eyeing potential financing deals and exploring a merger or sale since March. The brokerage announced in midJanuary it had entered exclusive negotiations with New York-based investor BGC Partners LP regarding a financing deal until Jan. 31. A deal failed to gel, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week.

Grubb said in the filing it "continues to be engaged in discussions with interested parties regarding the strategic process."

It's unknown if BGC or others previously interested in Grubb are among those parties.

Led by Chief Executive Howard Lutnick, BGC has a market value of almost $840 million. It bought one of Grubb 's competitors in the fall - Newmark Knight Frank, a New York-based brokerage - for $63 million and stock.

It's believed BGC was talking to Grubb about working capital or senior-debt refinancing.

Grubb's market value has fallen under $5 million in recent weeks. Then-Chicago-based Grubb was valued at closer to $300 million when it completed a merger with Santa Anabased NNN Realty Advisors Inc. in late 2007.

The merged company kept the betterknown Grubb name while consolidating headquarters in Santa Ana.

C-III Moves On

Prior to BGC, Grubb had been negotiating a possible deal with Irving, Texas-based C-ffl Capital Partners LLC - an affiliate of Island Capital Group LLC - and Santa Monica-based hedge fund Colony Capital LLC, An exclusive negotiating agreement between those parties expired in mid-January without a deal being struck.

Andrew Farkas, former chairman of Insignia Financial Group Inc. and one of New York's better-known real estate executives, is chief executive of C-III, which on Jan. 25 closed on the acquisition of another brokerage, Princeton, N. J. -based NAI Global.

NAI Global will continue to operate as a separate company under current management, officials said.

NAI's Newport Beach office counts about 30 brokers and ranked as Orange County's 6th largest commercial brokerage in 2010 with $576 million of lease and sales deals, according to the Business Journal's most recent data.

Grubb was No. 3 on the Business Journal's list of top local brokerages last year with about $ 1.4 billion in revenue and 82 brokers in its Newport Beach and Orange offices.

Professional Probate Instructions Continue to Fall

BRISTOL, ENGLAND--(Marketwire - Feb. 6, 2012) - For the last few years, official figures released by the Probate Service have shown that applications made for a Grant of Representation (usually a Grant of Probate or Letters of Administration) by solicitors have fallen for the last three years (2008 to 2010). Professional applications fell by 4% in 2010 and by 9% and 10% respectively in 2009 and 2008. Numbers have declined by 30% in total since 2006.

The firm Title Research, which published the Probate Service statistics, suggests a number of reasons for this trend. It can partly be explained by a gradual rise over the years in applications from private individuals, who have decided to administer the deceased's estate themselves rather than using a solicitor, either through personal choice or for reasons of economy. However, private applications actually fell by 1% in 2010.

Other contributing factors could include a more relaxed attitude from banks and buildings societies towards the need for a Grant of Representation, and an increasing number of estates falling below the GBP 5,000 threshold under which Probate is not required. It could also be suggested that a reluctance to pay Inheritance Tax is also causing some people to avoid applying for Probate on an estate they are administering.

A Probate expert at The Co-operative Legal Services, comments: 'Without a doubt, there are a number of reasons for the decline in professional Probate applications. This certainly isn't solely due to an increase in "DIY Probate" over time. Having said that, with today's tough economic climate, it is likely that more people will try and handle Probate and administer estates themselves in the next few years.

'If any mistakes are made on the legal, tax and administrative responsibilities involved in Probate, this could prove extremely costly to put right. For example, undervaluing an estate could lead to you having to pay a large fine as well as the extra Inheritance Tax liability. I would recommend all executors of a Will - or next of kin in cases of intestacy - to seek legal advice before applying for the Grant of Representation, and consider appointing a professional to administer the estate on their behalf.'

The Co-operative Legal Services' Probate experts offer free advice and support on the Probate process, executor duties and related issues such as intestacy.

SAVERS SUFFER AS ECONOMIC GLOOM SLASHES RETURNS

THE prospect of a rise in interest rates is slipping further away as dark clouds hang over Britain's economic recovery.

As the economy slows again, the Bank of England is expected to pump in more money, putting a dampener on any hope of a rise in base rate soon. Economists' predictions of when it will climb from its historic 0.5pc low range from 2013 to 2016.

Monthly income-seekers are facing lower rates than those on offer just a few months ago. Back then, there were plenty of fixed-rate deals paying 2.72pc after tax (3.3pc before) for a year. Now, they are few and far between.

The top deal on the High Street comes from Santander at 2.52pc (3.15pc), on a minimum of £25,000, down from 2.76pc (3.45pc) at the end of last year. A 0.3pc cut before tax on this sum translates into a £75 a drop in income each year.

You can earn more if you are willing to tie up your money for two years - at best 3.18pc (3.98pc) with BM Savings, part of Halifax. The best deal in the High Street comes from C&G at 2.99pc (3.74pc).

The advice of economists is not to tie up your money for longer than two years, as inflation and interest rates could be on the way up by then. Andrew Goodwin, economic adviser at consultancy the ITEM Club, says: 'Fixing for a shorter period makes sense. Inflation will start to rise again when interest rates move up.'

Professor Andrew Clare, from Cass Business School, London, says: 'Two-year bonds paying around 4pc before tax are not bad value, but I'd not tie my money up for longer than that.'

Some High-Street providers pay far less. Barclays offers just 1.5pc (1.98pc) over one year, or £13 income after tax on each £10,000 in your account. Lloyds TSB also pays a poor 1.6pc (2pc) and Halifax 1.78pc (2.23pc). These rates are less than you can earn on an easy-access account.

Make sure that when your fixed-rate deal finishes, you move your money - or you can end up earning a pittance. Halifax pays just 0.08pc (0.1pc) or 66p a month after tax on each £10,000 in its maturity account. You can end up with the same rate with other banks, too.

You can earn tax-free income on your cash Isas, although only a few banks and building societies offer monthly income. But Yorkshire BS and its offshoots Chelsea and Barnsley have launched an 18-month deal at 3.15pc tax-free.

Some banks and building societies traditionally pay less interest to savers in tax-free cash Isa accounts than on similar taxable bonds - effectively denying them some of the tax relief they could earn on these plans.

Tax incentives for retirement plans should be preserved: ICI survey

More than eight in 10 households believe the current tax incentives to encourage retirement saving should be preserved, according to new research by the Investment Company Institute. The research is based on data collected in a survey of 3,000 U.S. households at the end of last year.

The ICI study-America's Commitment to Retirement Security: Investor Attitudes and Actions-found that such agreement was consistently high across various demographic and financial characteristics. Households were asked their views on changing the tax incentives for retirement plans and whether saving incentives for retirement should be a national priority.

It found that households overwhelmingly support maintaining the tax incentives for retirement saving. Eighty-five percent of all U.S. households disagreed when asked whether the tax advantages of defined contribution accounts should be eliminated. Eighty-three percent opposed any reduction in workers' account contribution limits. Among households owning defined contribution accounts or individual retirement accounts, nearly nine in 10 disagreed with eliminating or reducing the tax incentives.

A vast majority of households agree that preserving the current retirement savings incentives should be a national priority. Eighty-eight percent of households owning defined contribution accounts or IRAs agree with this policy priority, while 76 percent of households without defined contribution accounts or IRAs agree.

"It is clear that the current tax incentives to encourage Americans to build a nest egg in retirement accounts are effective and command the overwhelming support of the American public," said Paul Schott Stevens, ICI president and CEO. "Our latest household survey shows that a great majority of U.S. households believe, even in an era of necessary federal budget reforms, that preserving these incentives should be a national priority."

The 2011 household survey also polled respondents about their views on retirement plan saving and their confidence in 401(k) and other DC plan accounts.

The majority of households that have DC plans found that these plans promote retirement saving. Nine in 10 households with DC accounts agreed that these plans helped them think about the long term and made it easier for them to save. More than 80 percent of DC-owning households said the immediate tax savings from their retirement plans were a big incentive to contribute.

Investors greatly value the ability to choose and control their investments. Nearly all households with DC accounts agreed that it was important to have choice in, and control of, the investment options in their DC plans. Seventy-nine percent said their plan offers a good lineup of investment options.

"As in prior years, our 2011 survey confirms that Americans, whether they own retirement accounts or not, have a great deal of confidence in the 401(k) system," said Sarah Holden, ICI senior director of retirement and investor research. "Despite the ups and downs of the stock market and other troubling financial and economic news, favorable attitudes and DC plan investors' retirement savings patterns are holding steady."

'Safe' Stocks Off to Wobbly Start in 2012; Hough: Consumer staples shares have been stars in recent years. Now they look vulnerable.

Stock investors are having a mostly happy new year. The S&P 500-stock index returned around 5% through Friday. And yet the slice of the index that represents safety to many investors -- consumer staples -- is down slightly.

Earnings for the sector have likewise failed to impress. It's early in the current reporting season, with results in for just 59 of the 500 index members; 20 of those companies, or 34%, have so far fallen short of Wall Street forecasts -- a higher than usual miss rate. For consumer staples companies, however, four out of six, or 67%, have missed estimates.

Staples are goods like food, beer, cigarettes and diapers that tend to stay in steady demand even when the economy sours. Nervous investors have rushed into shares of companies that sell such goods in recent years, bidding prices higher. The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR, an exchange-traded fund, has returned an average of 6.8% a year over the past five years, versus just 0.3% a year for the broader SPDR S&P 500, even though fees on the latter are about half as high.

That has left staples shares priced at a premium. The sector recently traded at 16 times projected 2011 earnings, versus 13 times earnings for the broad 500 index. Fast earnings growth can make such premiums worth paying, but analysts foresee below-average earnings growth for staples companies this year -- 8%, versus 10% for the index.

The economic profiles of some staple goods may have changed. An abundance of small-batch beer has left big brewers fighting volume declines, and spirits and wine have gotten posher, fueling past growth but adding to economic sensitivity today. Tobacco faces smoking bans. Even packaged food makers are caught between higher ingredient prices and a reluctance among shoppers to pay more.

General Mills, which makes Cheerios, and Constellation Brands, which distributes Robert Mondavi wines, each fell short of analyst forecasts earlier this month. Altria, which makes Marlboro cigarettes, reports earnings on Friday.

If staples shares look weak at the moment, technology shares look surprisingly strong. Within the S&P 500, the sector is up 6% this year. It trades at around 13 times earnings. Only two of 12 companies that have reported earnings during the current season have missed forecasts. Last Thursday, Microsoft, IBM and Intel each reported upside surprises.

Together, those three have an average dividend yield 2.5%, just shy of the 2.7% yield for the SPDR staples fund. And although computer chips, software and technology consulting won't hold up like franks and beans in the event of another recession, the tech trio has a balance sheet advantage. Many staples companies use considerable debt to try to enhance returns. IBM owes little and pays minuscule interest rates. Microsoft and Intel sit on large cash surpluses.

"Guests know the couple are spending a lot on the wedding"

MORE brides and grooms are asking for cash as a wedding gift, but is it OK to request money on your big day?

It's traditional in some countries to pin cash to a bride's gown, while in Australia about one in every two couples getting hitched specify they want money as a gift, wedding expert Anne Mihelakos from truebride.com.au says.

"It's becoming more and more acceptable,'' she says.

"One reason is because more couples are living together and they already have most traditional gifts people buy and they try to avoid getting a second toaster.

"But it comes a lot more for convenience as well, and guests know the couple are spending a lot on the wedding and honeymoon, so they are quite happy to contribute to a cause.''

Couples often fork out tens of thousands on their big day and many are keen to try to escape getting unwanted gifts.

Wishing wells at a reception venue have become popular and are designed to collect gifts of money or vouchers.

But social etiquette expert Anna Musson, of The Good Manners Company, believes asking for money is "crass''.

"It's just a cash grab,'' she says. "If a couple has been living together before getting married and don't need anything, it's a little gauche to ask for anything at all, and even more so to ask for cash. What is the cash going towards?

"It's not in Australian culture to ask for cash, but if you have a background where that's what the custom is, then knock yourself out.''

Musson says when you do purchase a wedding gift, deliver it to the bride's home to avoid them having to hire a mini-van to collect their gifts from the reception venue. If you are giving cash, decide on how much to give.

Sunshine Coast wedding planner Kim Eibrink Jansen has more than 20 years' experience planning weddings and says guests are often unsure on how much money to give.

"In some countries, they actually have rules where you purchase or give money to the cost of how much it would cost for each person to attend the reception,'' she says.

"If you think the cost of the reception may be about $120 a head, the guest should contribute that much for the gift. So if it's one person, it's about $120 or $150, or if it's two people, maybe $300. But again, it's personal, it depends on how much people want to give.''

Eibrink Jansen says there are ways to ask for money that include telling guests what the money will be spent on.

"I always recommend my clients to put something in their invitations, whether it's a special card which has a reference to a wishing well or a wishing tree,'' she says.

DJ WEALTH ADVISER: Donor-Advised Funds 'Double' Bottom Line

--Donors are looking harder at the choices within their donor-advised funds

--Advisers need to understand socially aware investments

--Some predict donors' interest in the "double bottom line" will continue to grow 


 
    By Veronica Dagher 
    A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN 
 

NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Deb Wetherby, a San Francisco fee-based certified financial planner, has taken a closer look at the $500,000 in investments one of her clients had in a donor-advised fund invested in large- and small-cap U.S. stocks.

The client felt that some of the companies did not reflect her values. So Wetherby found a fund run by RSF Social Finance, which had what appeared to be a more congenial social impact and comparable returns.

"More clients are interested in achieving a double-bottom line with their charitable dollars," she said.

Only a small number of donor-advised funds also have social impact investment screens or goals, but they are attracting more interest. For example, the socially responsible pool within Schwab Charitable, the second-largest national donor-advised fund by assets after Fidelity Charitable, has more than tripled to $7.5 million since its introduction in 2009. The pool is invested in the Parnassus Equity Income Fund (PRBLX).

Kim Laughton, Schwab Charitable's president, expects interest to grow steadily over the next 10 years as investors continue to seek "good returns without harming society over the long term." Laughton said investors will increasingly look for investing opportunities that do no long-term harm as they realize they don't need to sacrifice return.

Schwab has also seen an uptick in clients with $250,000 or more seeking to invest in socially responsible hedge funds, venture capital deals and private equity funds--for example, a fund for timber conservation.

Meanwhile, the roughly $65 million donor-advised fund of nonprofit financial services company ImpactAssets has grown 33% a year over each of the last three years, said Fran Seegull, its managing director of investments. The company's Giving Fund focuses on sustainable agriculture, affordable housing, and health and education in the developing world. It is also building an online platform for financial advisers to learn about impact investing and tap into a global database of relevant debt and equity fund managers. Advisers can engage clients in "a dialogue about their values and deepen the relationship," Seegull said.

SEC's Rominger: Agency Using 'Investor Testing' in Target Date Rulemaking Process

The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting "investor testing" as part of its rulemaking efforts on target date funds, to help the agency assess "the types of information that investors believe are most useful when they choose their investments," Eileen Rominger, director of the SEC's Division of Investment Management, said Tuesday.

In 2010, the SEC proposed rule changes to address concerns regarding target date fund names and information presented in target date fund marketing materials, Rominger said in a speech before securities lawyers. To date, Rominger (left) continued, target date fund disclosures have been tested on about 1,000 investors.

"After we analyze the testing data and consider public comments on the proposed rule, the division will evaluate whether to recommend that the commission adopt rule changes to address target date funds," she said.  

As of October, assets in target date funds had reached approximately $360 billion, Rominger said. The new cash flow that target date funds netted in 2010, she said, was over 10 times what it was 10 years ago. She cited a recent survey that found that 70% of U.S. employers use target date funds as the default investment in their defined contribution plans.

"The increasing significance of target date funds in 401(k) retirement plans--together with the market losses suffered in 2008-gave rise to concerns about those funds."

The SEC, Rominger said, will continue in 2012 to incorporate "empirical data" into the regulatory process. The SEC's oversight of money market funds, she said, "is a good example of our continued focus on improving information collection and utilization."

As a result of the first phase of money market reform approved by the commission in February 2010, the SEC has been receiving detailed holdings data for each of the past 12 months, which is submitted via form N-MFP and is "extensively analyzed and considered by the SEC staff," Rominger explained.

In the last year, the SEC has received filings from over 650 money market funds each month, or about 8,000 filings altogether. Each month, she said, "these funds report about 70,000 different positions in all their portfolios, and we are using the data to monitor characteristics and trends of holdings, and to identify areas that raise questions." This data will also help us better assist other regulators with systemic risk monitoring responsibilities, such as Treasury and the Federal Reserve.

The data, she continued, is increasingly used as a point of reference during examinations. "As our IM staff participates in exams of money market funds, we will occasionally ask questions about holdings and trends. This is helpful in gaining a general sense of the portfolio decision-making process. If you are part of one of these discussions, I encourage you to avoid reading too much into these high level questions, as it is not our intention to convey a specific point of view on these individual securities."

Patricia Dunn gave investors a better mousetrap; Commentary: Financial services exec helped lead an index-fund revolution

SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Patricia Dunn will be remembered mostly for the infamous boardroom espionage scandal that ultimately cost her the chairmanship of Hewlett-Packard Co.

Yet Dunn, who died Sunday at 58 after a long battle with cancer, deserves credit from any investor who has ever owned an exchange-traded fund.

As the head of Barclays Global Investors in the late 1990s, Dunn supported efforts to put the global money manager's considerable muscle behind a relatively unproven investment that tracked an index but traded like a stock. Just over a decade later, the mammoth iShares suite of ETFs that BGI created is the largest ETF provider, and asset management powerhouse BlackRock Inc (BLK, US) runs that show.

When iShares rolled out in 2000, the rebranding of a BGI product called World Equity Benchmark Shares, or WEBS, the ETF business was growing but its potential was still unclear.

Traditional mutual-fund companies then, as now, didn't want to finance a product that might cannibalize their lineup, but BGI was an institutional index-fund manager and its fortune wasn't tied to active fund management. Even still, Dunn battled opposition within BGI to developing the iShares line.

Dunn was no stranger to indexing, or to taking on an unpopular fight. She'd joined Wells Fargo Investment Advisors, a numbers-crunching San Francisco based shop, as a part-time secretary, and was there when the firm launched the first index fund in the early 1970s. (The fund was institutional only; several years later their work attracted attention from an enterprising fund industry veteran named John Bogle, who saw index funds as ideal vehicles for his new retail-oriented company The Vanguard Group.)

Dunn rose through the ranks at Wells Fargo and ascended to the top of the Investment Advisors business in 1995, the same year British banking company Barclays Plc bought the Wells unit and renamed it Barclays Global Investors.

Dunn stepped down as BGI's CEO in 2002 for health reasons, and resigned from BGI's board in 2006 after the California attorney general filed felony charges against her related to the H-P scandal. The charges were later dropped.

In the late 1990s I interviewed Dunn for a magazine assignment and she spoke of BGI's plan to push ETFs into the mainstream. Dunn was cautiously optimistic.

She and her team didn't know what to expect, she said, but we think ETFs are a "better mousetrap."

Then, the ETF industry had about $80 billion under wraps. Today, more than $1.5 trillion is invested in these products globally, with iShares handling about $600 billion of that total.

In hindsight, that was no mousetrap. It's catnip.

New round of QE to cut pension income

£75bn injection set to hit annuity rates by buying up gilts and lowering their yields, writes Alice Ross

Savers approaching retirement have been warned that they could face a reduced income from their pensions after the Bank of England decided this week to launch a fresh round of quantitative easing .

The decision by the Bank to inject a further £75bn into the economy by buying gilts is likely to lead to lower annuity rates, experts say - at a time when the amount of income that people can buy with their pension funds is already at a record low .

More demand for gilts is likely to lower their yields, which are used by insurance companies to determine how much income for life they can offer through annuities.

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown, warned that in the aftermath of the first round of quantitative easing, in 2009, there were 18 annuity rate cuts and just two rises.

"The need to stimulate the economy is only too clear but an unfortunate side-effect of quantitative easing is that it will result in another cut in pensioners' income at a time when they can ill-afford it," said Billy Mackay, marketing director at AJ Bell, the pensions provider.

This week, PwC warned that people approaching retirement faced a "double whammy" of falling pension values due to the stock market slump, and low annuity rates. It calculated that pension incomes are now 30 per cent lower than they were three years ago.

A pension pot of £300,000 now buys just £18,500 a year, down from £22,500 a year in 2008 - but stock market falls will also have had an impact.

"Many people retiring now will be caught between a rock and a hard place," said Peter McDonald, a partner at PwC. "If they defer buying an annuity until prices improve, they're stuck with no income in the meantime, which might not be an option."

McPhail said it was crucial that anyone approaching retirement shops around for an annuity to make sure they get the best possible income - which can vary by up to 40 per cent from different providers.

A new agreement coming into force will prevent insurers from including annuity purchase forms in their pre-retirement packs - which can result in consumers missing out on the best deal, because they do not realise they are under no obligation to buy an annuity from their existing pension provider.

Smokers or those in poor health should also check to see whether they are eligible for impaired - or enhanced - annuities, as these often pay better rates, based on life expectancy.

McPhail said that anyone hoping markets would recover and the value of their pension would rise should consider phasing their annuity purchases. This can involve buying an annuity to last a year or two using just a small slice of the overall pension pot.

2011 BMW 335d; Proving that even a diesel system can be a pleasure to drive

DAMASCUS, Md. (MarketWatch) - Imagine a car that delivers great handling, good power, and lots of driving fun. Now imagine that car being largely ignored by the general public.

That is the problem confronting BMW (BMW, XE) and other exporters of diesel-powered cars to the U.S.

Although diesels are embraced in Europe, largely because of the high price of gasoline, Americans tend to shy away from them in droves, having been caught behind too many black-smoke-belching (older) trucks and buses. Another turn-off is that diesel fuel prices in the U.S. tend to be higher than gasoline.

But newer diesels, like the one in the BMW 335d, have given up black smoke as a bad part of their diet.

In the week the 335d was in the test fleet, only once did I detect the slight smell of diesel - and never inside the car. And never was there a hint of smoke.

But it's the torque that attracts drivers to the diesel burners.

The twin-turbo 3.0-liter diesel six in the test car packs 265 horsepower at 4,200 rpm, but generates 425 pound-feet of torque at just 1,750 rpm. Tied to a fast-acting 6-speed automatic, the 335d will go from standing still to 60 mph in just over 6 seconds.

There always seemed to be a wallop of acceleration just standing by waiting to be used. And then there's the diesel's promise of long life.

Much of the rest of the car is pure 3 series with outstanding handling and braking. Anyone who has driven one lately will feel right at home inside.

Interior space is fine for two adults, crowded for four. The instruments are easy to read and key controls come readily to hand.

Yet on occasion, some of the more complex controls continue to burp, requiring trips to the dealer and a car out of service.

Judging from owner comments posted on websites of various publications, these concerns generally revolve around BMW's iDrive. The test car was glitch-free.

It would also seem to me that forward progress on a trip will be slowed considerably if the owner is parked in a rest area reading news headlines, sports, weather, his or her e-mail and probably several other things that have been added since this system went to market. Set the navigation system before you leave, and hit the road, Jack.

And that alone should please anyone who likes to drive. The BMW would leave you smiling enough, even if it had a simpler system than the iDrive. This 3 series diesel, all in all, is another Bavarian treat.

This is one Bavarian treat that proves the pleasures on top of a diesel-powered drive train, says Ron Amadon.|103

CHAIRMAN BAUCUS AND RANKING MEMBER GRASSLEY APPLAUD PASSAGE OF BILL TO INCREASE TAX FAIRNESS, DETER TAX SHELTERS BY ELIMINATING PATENTS ON TAX STRATEGIES

WASHINGTON, Sept. 8 -- Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued the following news release:

Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and senior Committee member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) today applauded the Senate's passage of their bill to protect taxpayers and fight tax evasion, which was included in the larger patent reform bill. The Baucus-Grassley legislation prevents any individual or firm from patenting tax strategies, which could otherwise subject taxpayers to royalty fees for using the patented strategy when filing their taxes. The bill also stops tax patents from providing windfalls to lawyers and patent holders by preventing them from holding exclusive rights to use loopholes, which could provide some businesses with unfair advantages over their competitors. Now that both the House and Senate have passed the patent reform bill, it goes to the President for his signature.

"Unfair patents can give a small number of people a stranglehold on tax strategies that should be open to anyone," Baucus said. "This bill will bring fairness to the system, and it will deter the use of tax shelters to evade the responsibility we all share. Our ongoing tax reform effort will continue cleaning up the code, and it can create jobs and be a major boost to our economy."

"Tax strategy patents are on the rise. More and more legal tax strategies are unavailable or more expensive for more and more taxpayers," Grassley said. "It's important to protect intellectual property rights for true tax preparation and financial management software. At the same time, we have to protect the right of taxpayers to have equal access to legal tax strategies. That's necessary for fairness and tax compliance. We need more tax compliance, not less."

In order to obtain a patent, an inventor must show, among other things, that the claimed invention is novel and non-obvious and has a practical application. In 1998, the courts determined that a method of doing business may be patentable, and soon thereafter, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office began granting patents for various tax-related inventions.

Tax practitioners have long decried the issuance of these tax-strategy patents because they are unlikely to be novel, given the public nature of the tax code, and undermine the fairness of the Federal tax system by removing from the public domain particular ways of satisfying a taxpayer's legal obligations. The bill expressly provides that a strategy for reducing, avoiding or deferring tax liability cannot be considered a new or non-obvious idea, and therefore, a patent on a tax strategy cannot be obtained.

Baucus and Grassley have long been leaders in congressional efforts to protect taxpayers and prevent the patenting of tax strategies that result in extra costs for taxpayers.

Banks continue to be challenged by a shrinking net interest margin as well as high liquidity. Identifying acceptable investment opportunities with high credit quality and diversification continues to challenge most banks today. In addition, most banks are affected by the increasing cost of providing employee benefits.

As we have stated before, bankowned life insurance (BOLD continues to be an acceptable and prevalent solution to these challenges. Texas banks continue to explore BOLI and consider the BOLI yields available today as a partial solution to these challenges. According to the FDIC and Equias Alliance research, 52 percent of Texas banks with assets greater than $100 million owned BOLI assets as of March 31, 2011. In addition, highly rated insurance companies are offering very attractive BOLI yields and policy structures that most banks find acceptable for their overall portfolio strategy.

The annual yield on a BOLI investment compares favorably to other bank-eligible assets. Also, BOLI provides tax advantaged income not available with traditional bank investments. Banks earn income from the growth of the BOLI cash value and from the life insurance proceeds paid to the bank on the death of the Insured employee. In addition, the income earned from BOLI is tax deferred, and, if the BOLI contract is held until the death of the insured, the bank receives life insurance proceeds tax free. Growth in cash value is recorded as "Other Non- Interest Income" on the bank's financial statements.

As the owner and beneficiary of the BOLI policies, the management or board will typically select a group of bank officers to insure. This group may or may not participate in any executive benefit plans. While BOLI is not tied directly to the employee benefit programs, the policy income is designed to recover a portion of the employee benefit expenses.

Remember that BOLI is used as a cost recovery vehicle for pre- and post-retirement employee benefits, such as individual or group life insurance, health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, tuition reimbursement, deferred compensation and pension benefits. Also, remember to consider the interagency guidance as outlined in OCC-2004-56 regarding the purchase and administration of BOLI.

We have prepared an historical multiyear yield comparison showing a history of BOLI yields compared to other bank-eUgible bank assets. To request a copy of this comparison or a customized BOLI analysis, please contact Ken Derks at kderks@equiasalliance.com or 469-252-1037.

Careers
After Being Laid Off, Get Up

After being laid off twice, 26-year-old David Dvorkin plunged right back into the job market. He tapped everybody he knew for help, and after an intensive six-month search, he landed a job as an account executive for 77 WABC Radio in New York, where he's been working since 2008.

"On the surface, it looks like a failure," Mr. Dvorkin says of having lost two jobs in a relatively short time. But when interviewing for a new position, "I didn't downplay the layoffs," he says. "I knew they'd ask, so I turned the layoffs into a positive, learning experience."

While laid-off employees may be tempted to lean on their severance for a few months, the best thing to do is get right back into the job market, says Tim Honn, founder and president of Fortis Recruiting Solutions, in Lisle, Ill.Mr. Honn says he advises his clients to put a plan together and act as quickly as they can after losing a job.

"It's one thing to take a week off to recharge your batteries," he says. "If someone takes a protracted vacation to find themselves, it's hard to sell this to search-firm owners like me and employers."

Finding work should be regarded as a full-time job. Schedule your entire day with job-hunting activities like making calls, sending résumés and getting training that you need to update your skills. Keep healthy eating habits and get regular exercise to reduce stress and boost self-confidence.

Create a budget that slashes your overhead in case the job search goes longer than expected. Mr. Dvorkin moved back in with his parents and says his savings helped him be more selective in his job search.

If you're feeling burned out from a prolonged job search, or perhaps you've figured out that your previous line of work is no longer right for you, consider what changes or new training might help you qualify for a better job, or at least one that is a better fit.

"Redirect your anger into finding work. That refocused energy can read as passion," says Joel Mausner, a business psychologist at Workplace Psychology in Irvington, N.Y. "But don't vent to employers during interviews. Be calm and rational when talking about your last job, and don't place blame."

Tell everyone you're looking, says Mr. Honn, who urges job hunters to immediately leverage all of their personal and professional networks for leads. It can really help to have your résumé hand-delivered to a decision maker within a company.

Attend association events and trade shows to connect with peers who can tell you what their companies want in employees and what the workplace culture is like. Get business cards with your contact information, skills and expertise. Not everybody likes to be handed a résumé but most will take a card.

PROPERTY investors are facing fresh headwinds with rental income growth stuck below the pace of inflation.

As new research from RP Data shows, capital city rents over the past year have grown just 2.7 per cent, and financial experts say there are wider long-term forces at play for real estate investors to consider.

Australia's latest annual inflation rate is 3.3 per cent, and will be updated next week.

RP Data found Brisbane's median rent for houses is $370 a week and has not grown over the past three months. It is up just 2.8 per cent over the past year but 37 per cent higher over the past five years.

Brisbane's median rent for units is now $365 a week and is up 1.4 per cent for the June quarter, up 2.8 per cent for the past year and up 43.1 per cent for the past five years.

"As many investors will be aware, rental growth has been relatively subdued since 2008 due to a number of factors such as stimulus from low interest rates and the First Home Owner Grant boost which enticed prospective new homeowners into buying and eased demand for rentals," RP Data analyst Cameron Kusher says.

He expects stronger growth in the year ahead because depressed sales volumes and inactive first-home buyers should lead to increased competition for rental stock.

In the long term, structural changes in the rental market may also have an affect on investors' future returns.

New research by RAMS Home Loans suggests many Generation Y Australians are avoiding rentals and preferring instead to move straight from their family home into their own property.

Its survey of mortgage holders aged under 30 found 71 per cent have never rented.

"What we are increasingly seeing is younger Australians using this time to save for their own home instead and avoiding renting,'' RAMS chief executive Melos Sulicich says.

The next wave of young Australians - dubbed Generation Z - may become a generation of renters who do not aspire to own a home, Resi Mortgage Corporation CEO Lisa Montgomery says.

"This generation will have witnessed their Gen X parents juggle and leverage themselves in order to buy the property they want - whereas for Gen Z that idea is increasingly less attractive,'' she says.

In some European countries young people have no great aspirations for home ownership, Montgomery says.

"Parents of Gen Z are still holding the cards in their hands at the moment,'' she says.

"Because if their children don't create their own financial security through strategies such as property ownership, this may in turn affect the retirement plans of parents as well - leading to an unwelcome financial domino effect.

"Education for children in relation to how they view money and how they manage finances is vital. If that education and life lessons don't come from their parents, they can only rely on internet and other information sources.''

A trust will protect your estate

A s the Canadian population ages and their personal wealth increases, a growing number of couples have become concerned about the potential negative financial consequences of passing their estates on to their children.

Many Canadian couples will die with a net worth of $1-million or more and a surprising number of these couples have never properly planned on how this wealth will be transferred to the next generation.

The life-insurance industry has played a major role in developing financial products and policies to assist in the transfer of wealth in a tax-efficient manner at death; but life insurance is only one factor that older Canadians should consider when planning their estates.

What if you are leaving wealth to a disabled child? What about a cottage being left to multiple children that do not get along? What if you don't want your child's spouse or common-law partner to gain access to your child's inheritance upon the failure of their relationship? A solution to these and many similar problems could be a testamentary trust.

A trust is created when one party (the settlor) transfers assets to a trust and another party is responsible to deal with the assets (the trustee) for the benefit of named parties (beneficiaries). All this is done based on instructions that you have left to the trustee on how the assets and income they generate are to be used.

A testamentary trust is created by a will and becomes effective at one's death. Testamentary trusts can have several benefits, including tax benefits, protection of assets from creditors and family separation, and control of assets for disabled or spendthrift children.

One of the major benefits of a testamentary trust is the protection of assets from creditors and spouses of beneficiaries. By settling a trust in your will and transferring your child's inheritance to this trust, you can potentially shield these assets from anyone attempting to make a claim against your child.

This works by transferring your child's inheritance to a trust rather than to your child, so you are creating a legal barrier between your child and the assets held in trust. Technically speaking, your child does not own the assets or have the ability to get to the assets; they are owned by the trust.

If your child is in a profession or business prone to litigation, this is an excellent way to protect his/her inheritance from potential seizure. Further, if your child is in a rocky marriage, settling a trust can prevent the integration of your child's inheritance into family property, thereby preventing any claims to the assets should your child be involved in divorce proceedings.

Settling a testamentary trust can be fraught with legal and tax complications. It is important to engage competent advisors when considering any type of estate plan. However, with a bit of proper planning, the benefits can greatly outweigh the efforts spent.

Rebate cut may hurt hospital

NOOSA Hospital could be facing increased pressure to treat people and be forced to divert more patients to Nambour if a Federal Government means-test on private health insurance forces more than 1.6 million Australians to turn to the public sector for treatment over five years.

The Australian Health Insurance Association commissioned company Deloitte to report on the likely impacts of the government's policy to means-test the 30% rebate on private health insurance

The AHIA says the report rejects the Australian treasury's projections that only 25,000 people will drop their private health cover, instead estimating that 175,000 Australians will drop their cover in the first year alone.

And it warns that the cost of servicing the increased demand for public hospitals will outweigh the savings to government from means-testing the 30% rebate.

Noosa Hospital CEO Oli Steele said his management team had real concerns about the patient health outcomes if the AHIA research proved more accurate.

Mr Steele said Noosa patients would increasingly seek treatment in the public sector if they opted out of or reduced their private health insurance cover.

"This year approximately 10,000 private patients will be treated at Noosa Hospital," he said.

"A notional 10% reduction in private health insurance rates would mean 20 patients a week seeking treatment in the public sector who might otherwise have been treated here as a private patient."

Mr Steele said this would be at a time when other formerly insured patients from Nambour, Gympie and Buderim would be attempting to access the public health system, thus increasing pressure on waiting times for Sunshine Coast patients.

"Noosa patients presenting to our emergency department could increasingly need to be transferred to Nambour general," Mr Steele said.

"Currently emergency department patients with private insurance can be, and are, admitted as private patients to the hospital," he said.

"A reduction in private health cover in the area and of our many interstate travellers would put more strain on Noosa public beds, increasing the need for transfer."

"This might have a resource impact for QAS as well as colleagues at Nambour general," he said.

Mr Steele said the "mixed economy" of public and private work at 92-bed Noosa hospital enabled many visiting medical officers to supplement their public earnings with a private income.

"There is a potential threat that some (officers) might stop coming to Noosa if they find it isn't financially viable," he said.

Federal Health Minister Nicola Roxon this week reportedly rejected Deloitte's report by claiming the private health opt-out findings were based on "general questions being asked of 2000 people via a telephone poll without all the relevant financial information".

"People don't make decisions about budgets during phone polls; they make them in a considered fashion with all the facts available," Ms Roxon said.

CONCERNED: Noosa Hospital CEO Oli Steele, right, with Dr Ken Corbett.

Financial Adviser: Backlash on report's proposal to replace Isas.

Financial Adviser

(c) 2011 Financial Adviser      

The Institute for Public Policy Research has published a controversial report that suggests scrapping cash Isas in favour of a new lifetime bonus savings accounts.

The 48-page document, entitled Designing a Life-Course Savings Account: How to Help Low to Middle-Income Families Save More, said Isas have failed to boost savings rates and that most of the tax relief they offer goes to people who would have saved anyway.

It also claims that low to middle earners find the concept of interest payments difficult to understand and they would be more attracted by cash payments into their savings vehicles or by supermarket accounts that offered rewards in the form of in-store vouchers or loyalty cards.

Tony Dolphin, the report's author, argues that abolishing the popular Isa in favour of a lifetime account would encourage saving among low to middle-income earners.

He described the cash Isa a "tax shelter" used by middle and high earners. He conceded that a lifetime account, which would pay an annual bonus on a sliding scale, would be "hugely unpopular" with middle and high earners and retired savers, but said it would be attractive for families on low to middle incomes.

The lifetime account would be a universal deposit account with a full government guarantee and a size limit of GBP10,000. Only four withdrawals would be allowed each year and the government would pay a bonus into accounts on a sliding scale, up to a maximum of GBP183.33 a year.

Interest would ideally be tax-free but if this were not possible, it should be taxed at the saver's normal marginal rate. The savings would also be exempt from asset testing for welfare benefits.

The report said: "This would allow most families to accumulate the three months' post-tax income. Research shows tax relief is a poor incentive to save so incentives could be liable for income tax at a person's normal marginal rate."

Jemma Jackson, public relations manager for the Association of Investment Companies, said Isas have been successful and were established in the savings landscape.

She said: "It seems unlikely they will be scrapped. But while any moves to encourage more low and middle-income families to save more should be welcomed, the best way to achieve this is through financial education."

Tony Vine-Lott, director general of the Tax Incentivised Savings Association, said: "Some 20m people have an Isa and many are lower earners or young people so it is not just something for the rich.

"There is a need to help low-income people but do not do it at the expense of the 20m who are successfully saving in Isas. It is counter-productive."

Colin Jackson, director of Essex-based Baronworth Investment Services, called the research "absolute rubbish". He said: "Many of our clients are not wealthy but know the value of saving, especially with the returns being tax-free on an Isa."

Why it pays to navigate perils of flexible drawdown

504 words

Mass market savers' hopes of gaining early access to their pension have been dashed. But for high net worth investors the door is still firmly open to flexible drawdown provided they get the right advice.

Flexible drawdown has been hailed as a 'masterstroke' by some in the pensions industry. They argue it will help stimulate saving by removing fears that all money is being locked away.

But confusion over the rules surrounding the measure could prevent some savers from taking advantage. Flexible drawdown has strengthened the case for a financial adviser. The finer details of HM Revenue & Customs' (HMRC) rules on the measure will be lost on many savers.

Pension administrators Talbot and Muir helped cut through some of the confusion last week when they relayed a clarification of the rules they had received from HMRC.

The clarification focused on the minimum income requirement (MIR) needed to qualify for flexible drawdown. That has been set at £20,000, and some have assumed it needs to be earned over 12 months. Not the case, says Talbot and Muir director of pension consultancy Nathan Bridgeman. Instead the MIR needs to be evidenced for the tax year in which flexible drawdown is taken.

Savers wanting to take flexible drawdown for the 2011/12 tax year, for example, now have 11 months to show they meet the MIR, not the 12 some had assumed.

This will impact on the way savers intend to get that income. If an annuity is used, monthly payments will need to be larger than they would had the 12-month timeline applied.

Other threats to savers qualifying for the measure include the carry forward rules and those around contributions. Contribute to your pension and you immediately disqualify yourself from taking drawdown that year. Carry forward entitlements from previous tax years to contribute and you do the same.

Advisers will therefore be crucial to helping those who would benefit from flexible drawdown to ensure they qualify for the facility, and do not slip up on any of the technicalities.

The prize for those who qualify, and are suitable for flexible drawdown, is worth the effort. Not only will those who qualify do so for life, they will also avoid the pitfalls of capped drawdown that are soon to get a lot worse.

Savers who choose capped drawdown are set to be hit by a triple whammy. First, payments will be calculated at the 100% Government Actuary's Department (GAD) rate. Second, GAD, calculated according to annuity rates, will be affected by the implementation of the European Court of Justice's ruling on gender pricing in December, which will cause annuities to fall. Third, Solvency II is on the horizon for insurers. From 1 January 2013, they will be forced to comply with higher capital adequacy requirements, leading them to put their money in safer, lower return, investments thereby hitting annuity rates.

Advisers may find that for some clients, now is the time to act.

The Emergent Success of MyLifeAudit Life Insurance Policy Review Leads to Formation of Life Audit Professionals, LLC.

2011 Content Enterprises, Inc.      

Boca Raton, FL, April 20, 2011 --(PR.com)-- Managing member, Richard Newman, CPA, today announced the establishment of Life Audit Professionals, LLC, the company responsible for developing MYLIFEAUDIT, a proprietary life insurance policy review system.

MYLIFEAUDIT was developed while Newman was a partner at Newman + Cohen Financial Management along with partner Donald Cohen, and Jeremy Bloom, director of business development. MYLIFEAUDIT provides an independent and unbiased detailed analysis of life insurance policies and can be used by the estate planning community, i.e., attorneys, CPAs, and wealth managers.

When asked why there has been a critical demand for MYLIFEAUDIT, Newman said, "As a result of the economic downturn, extended period of low interest rates, and existing policies utilizing older more expensive mortality expenses, a scenario has been created where 65-75 percent of in-force life insurance policies are underperforming. Underperformance could mean risk of lapsing, secure much higher death benefit for the same premium, or potentially lower the premium by more than 50 percent for the same death benefit in many cases. It is amazing how many times we find that policies are owned improperly which could trigger a significant tax consequence."

Life Audit Professionals, through its MYLIFEAUDIT process and partnership with Ash Brokerage Corporation, one of the largest privately held independent life insurance brokerage agencies in the United States, has audited thousands of policies resulting in significant policy benefit improvements to policy holders.

"Just like a stock portfolio, bond portfolio or real estate holdings, life insurance is an asset that must be expertly managed," said Newman. "We are only interested in the most appropriate product from the carrier with the highest ratings and at the best possible price. Being an independent firm allows us to analyze the marketplace rather than just one carrier or a few carriers. It is not possible for one carrier to always have the appropriate product at the best possible price, and that is why we are independent."

Bloom concurred, "The power of Richard's CPA background and tax knowledge, coupled with his more than 20 years of life insurance experience, empowers our firm to provide solutions rather than push individual products that may not be in the client's best interest. As a solution-based firm using a conservative approach supported by ethical, unbiased and reliable information, we better position professional estate planning advisors to provide prudent life insurance recommendations to their clients."

Effective today, Newman, Bloom, Andrew Shamp (a non-practicing estate planning attorney who currently serves solely as a financial representative) and key staff members can be found at the new headquarters located in Boca Raton at 2101 N.W. Corporate Boulevard, Suite 300.

The April 18, 2011 deadline for filing Form 8939 - Allocation of Increase in Basis for Property Acquired From a Decedent - has been extended indefinitely by the Internal Revenue Service. Form 8939 is an informational return used to document the basis, for income tax purposes, of property acquired from the estate of a decedent who died in 2010 and for which the executor has elected out of the application of the federal estate tax. Originally, the IRS stated that Form 8939 was to be filed along with the decedent's final Form 1040 no later than April 18, 2011. The filing extension is likely due to the fact that, as of the time of the March 31st announcement, the IRS had not yet finalized and published Form 8939.

In addition, the recent IRS announcement also states that the forthcoming guidance on filing Form 8939 will provide information on the manner in which an executor of an estate of a decedent dying in 2010 may elect to have the estate tax not apply. The IRS stated that it will announce the new deadline for filing Form 8939 at some point in the future and that the revised deadline will provide for a reasonable period of time for the preparation and filing of Form 8939.

Prior to the enactment on December 6, 2010 of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (the Act), the estate tax was repealed for decedents dying in 2010. While the Act reinstates the estate tax for 2010 decedents and provides for an estate tax exemption amount of $5,000,000, it also permits executors of the estates of 2010 decedents to elect out of the reinstatement of the federal estate tax. However, rather than taking a basis in an asset acquired from a 2010 decedent equal to the asset's current fair market value, as is the rule in cases of estate which are subject to the federal estate tax, beneficiaries acquiring assets from the estate of a decedent that has elected out of the application of the federal estate tax will take a modified carryover basis in such assets, which is to be determined by filing Form 8939. As result, provided a proper election is made, the estate of a decedent dying in 2010 will not be subject to the federal estate tax, but the executors of such electing estates are required to file Form 8939.

The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.

Pension reforms: little public sympathy for public sector staff

Given that 10m to 15m private sector workers have no pension trade unions can expect little support from the general public

Private sector employees are unlikely to feel any sympathy for the nurses, teachers and firefighters told to retire later, take a lower payout and pay more for their pension.

Between 10 million and 15 million workers in the private sector have no pension at all. Of the remainder, most pay into retirement plans dependent on stock market returns.

In the last 10 years the market has effectively declined, leaving most with little more than the sum of their own and their employers' contributions in a meagre pension pot.

By contrast 90% of the public sector's 5.5m workers are members of the various government-run schemes.

The career average scheme put forward by Lord Hutton as an alternative to the current final salary arrangements will mean a small cut in retirement income for lower paid staff. Final salary schemes benefit the managers and directors in an organisation, with little gain for cleaners and teaching assistants who retire on a salary almost identical to the one they started on.

So most public sector workers will be only marginally worse off compared to people in the private sector, where pension contributions by employers have halved in recent years and payouts by as much two-thirds.

Ten years of trade union campaigning to protect final salary schemes for the privileged few - ie their declining membership - has taught people to understand the benefits they might lose and want to protect them. But it is still difficult to see how they will gain widespread sympathy for their fight.

One threat floated by the government - that workers will face immediate hikes in contributions - has been ducked by Hutton, who prefers a "cap and share" deal that will be worked out over the next decades. Cap and share will force public sector staff to negotiate a cost-sharing arrangement when life expectancy increases or other costs of providing a pension bust the budget. Contributions from both employer and staff will rise rather than just the employer. The employee will have the option of taking a slightly lower pension benefit instead.

The Treasury could press ahead with an early rise in contributions. The chancellor, George Osborne, signalled his intent to save £1.8bn from higher contributions during the comprehensive spending review but Hutton has robbed Osborne of the political cover he craved for this measure, and it may be quietly dropped.

To most people this will seem like a fair starting point when public sector workers have already established such a high watermark. Moving to a standard 65 retirement age is something the private sector accepted a long time ago. Many will retire much later simply because their stock market-related funds have underperformed and they need to invest them for longer to produce a decent retirement income.

Financial Adviser: Structured cash Isas may damage Isa brand: report.

The potential inclusion of structured products in cash Isas could undermine the popularity of the investment vehicle, according to a report from the Tax Incentivised Savings Association.

The 152-page Isa Market report said that calls to include structured products within the traditional cash Isa would introduce an element of volatility that removes the whole rationale for investing in the low-risk product.

The report said: "This is perceived by many as a detrimental move that could undermine the Isa brand. Isas need to continue to be simple, safe and secure to retain their reputational advantage."

It said that saving levels could improve if there were a review of the appropriateness of the investment vehicles, such as structured products, within cash Isas.

It also suggested that it is important for the industry to understand the changing patterns of seasonality so that Isa communication is spread throughout the year, not just in the first few months of each year.

A survey of 1500 people showed that investors turn to cash Isas when they are looking to maximise the return on their rainy day funds. This is why Isas are the third most popular financial product, the report found.

However, the report also indicated that fewer people are intending to put money into Isas this year. Some 43 per cent of those quizzed said they put money into their Isa in 2009/2010, whereas only 35 per cent stated their intention to purchase an Isa in 2010/2011.

In the FSA's discussion paper DP11/1 on product intervention, the regulator said it was scrutinising the use of structured products.

Jason Witcombe, director for London-based IFA Evolve Financial Planning, said: "I agree with Tisa that cash Isas should remain cash. If people want to opt for structured products then they can choose stocks and shares Isas. Investors in cash Isas like the simplicity of the product so any complexities will only lead to problems."

The report comes as Gary Shaughnessy, UK managing director for Fidelity, is heading a campaign to reinstate dividend tax credit on Isas to encourage more people to use these as part of their retirement planning.

He said he will be talking to the Treasury and the government about bringing back the tax credit for normal rate taxpayers, which was removed in 2003.

Mr Shaughnessy said: "Isas are popular and people understand there is a tax advantage to them and that they are flexible. The removal of the dividend tax credit was unnecessary for a relatively small amount of money for the Treasury. The savings ratio is not where it needs to be, particularly for base-rate taxpayers, and we need to give people every incentive to save through Isas."

Philip Church, proprietor for Glasgow-based Pension Investment Management, said: "People understand the concept of Isas more than pensions and if these proposals are a way to encourage more people to save, they should be considered."

EDITORIAL: Chief's retirement points to problem

Dec. 26--We hate to use someone we admire as an example of a system gone awry.

But in this case, we must.

The retirement of Redlands Police Chief Jim Bueermann at age 53, when he's in the prime of his ability to manage a police department, is another downside to the generous pension benefits afforded to public employees.

Bueermann is nationally and internationally known as an expert in modern policing techniques. He advises about a dozen boards and institutions across the United States, and even in the United Kingdom, on law enforcement techniques and policies. He's a charter member of the Society of Police Futurists International.

Bueermann was one of 100 law enforcement leaders, mayors and scholars from across the nation invited to the White House Conference on Gang Violence and Crime Control last year.

George Mason University inducted Bueermann this year into its Center for Evidence- Based Crime Policy Hall of Fame. "These innovative leaders translate findings from research into everyday tactics and strategies to improve the legitimacy and effectiveness of law enforcement," the deputy director of that center said of Bueermann and the other members of the first class of inductees.

Bueermann's department has been featured on Apple.com for its use of the iPhone and iPad in crime-fighting efforts.

Clearly, the Redlands chief is no slouch when it comes to policing and to directing a department.

Does anyone think this guy is past his prime at 53, ready to hang up his holster and rock on the porch?

No, he's at the top of his game, on the young side actually for a top-level administrator.

But he's been working for the Redlands Police Department since 1978, chief since 1998. Under the 3 at 30 pension rules, he can retire now and draw about 96 percent of his final salary as a pension.

Why would he stay?

He's been incentivized to quit, draw a large pension and take another high-level job somewhere else.

We greatly admire Jim Bueermann and the work he has done as Redlands chief of police. We wish him all the best, while thinking he could and should do a great job of running a police department for another decade at least. We understand that from a personal perspective, he should do whatever gives him the best opportunity to flourish and use his abilities.

At the same time, the 3 at 30 retirement plans for safety personnel are clearly too generous, giving strong incentives to top-notch people to retire too early. Our view is that pensions should be withheld until civil servants actually retire.

It should make people comfortable in their retirement, not allow them to collect essentially two generous salaries at once.
