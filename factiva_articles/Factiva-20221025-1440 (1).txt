Mr F N from Wylam writes:    

I hold around £40,000 in savings which is held in a combination of banks, building society accounts, ISAs and PEPs.    

Because I am now a higher rate taxpayer I want to transfer the money from my bank and building society accounts to my wife's who is a lower rate taxpayer. Is there any limit on how much I can transfer every tax year?    

There is no limit on the amount you can transfer and there is no income tax or capital gains tax to pay when transferring money between husband and wife.    

If you are considering inheritance tax planning, then inheritance tax only comes into play if you are giving money to someone other than the person to whom you are married.    

Mr & Mrs D O from Felton write:    

We are in the process of selling our house and buying a more expensive one. We currently have an endowment life assurance policy linked to the mortgage. Can I link this endowment policy to my new mortgage to arrange part repayment/part endowment? My new mortgage will probably be with a different mortgage company.    

You will find that the vast majority of mortgage lenders will be able to offer you a part repayment/part endowment mortgage without any difficulty. Remember that life cover is important for that part of the loan which is on a repayment basis and I would strongly advise you to speak to an Independent Financial Adviser who will source that with the lowest premium. Premium rates vary considerably between insurance companies.    

Mr & Mrs D R from Widdrington write:    

Although we recognise that over the longer term it may be sensible to invest money on the stockmarket we do want to make sure our capital is guaranteed. Are there any guaranteed bonds available similar to one we had with Norwich Union in the mid-90s? Thank you for your help.    

Many providers recognise that investors are still nervous about putting large capital sums into stockmarket investments despite the recent climb in the market. Norwich Union still offer a guaranteed bond (although this closes on August 22) for a five-year period offering full capital protection with the potential for up to five per cent growth every six months. Whilst guaranteeing a 100pc return of capital you must be aware that early encashment will result in payment of the market value of the underlying assets at the time of encashment and this may be less than the original sum invested.    

With any product such as this you must speak to an Independent Financial Adviser who can compare other investments currently available.

 INTERVIEW: Iron Ore Lures Consolidated Minerals

 Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 PERTH--(Dow Jones)- Australian manganese and chromite producer Consolidated Minerals Ltd. (A.CMN) next month launches its diversification into the booming iron ore industry next month. 

 The Perth-based group hopes the drilling program on its Mindy Mindy project in Western Australia will confirm theories that it contains a buried extension of the Yandicoogina iron ore system. 

 Both BHP Billiton (BHP) and Rio Tinto (RTP) operate separate mines on the main Yandicoogina deposit, which contains a type of ore that has won favor with Asian steelmakers in recent years. 

 "My team is quietly confident that there is iron ore on our tenement," said Michael Kiernan, managing director of Consolidated. 

 "We haven't been able to get hold of a drilling rig, but we're told there will be one available in the first or second week of September," he told Dow Jones Newswires. 

 Consolidated's iron ore ambitions rose to prominence last month when the company announced a joint venture on Mindy Mindy with Fortescue Metal Group, the company chaired by former Anaconda Nickel chief executive Andrew Forrest. 

 Kiernan said that Consolidated aims to find enough iron ore to support a 10 million metric tons per year mine. The ore could then be transported to a port using a proposed A$1.2 billion rail line and infrastructure development that has been proposed by Fortescue. 

 "The idea is that we'd develop a direct shipping project, share the development costs 50/50, and then we'd have access to the rail on a user-pay basis," he said. 

 Western Australia's iron ore sector is thriving at present because of a recent 9% benchmark price increase, caused by booming demand in China. BHP Billiton and Rio are expanding capacity, while South Africa's Kumba Resources and Australia's Hancock Prospecting have proposed a A$1.5 billion development on their Hope Downs deposit. 

 Consolidated shares have risen sharply since the deal with Fortescue, which will share exploration costs at Mindy Mindy. CSM shares were 2 cents lower at 85 cents Monday, off last Thursday's 12 month high of 88 cents which valued the company at about A$104 million. 

 But Kiernan attributes the rally in Consolidated's shares to the results of a recent European roadshow, which encouraged buying by Swiss-based investors. Consolidated is listed on stock exchanges in Australia and the U.K., and last month completed a compliance listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. 

 Last week Consolidated announced an unaudited A$11.1 million annual profit, down 20% on the previous year due mainly to start-up costs at its Coobina chromite mine. 

 Kiernan said that he expects profits to rebound in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004, on the back of firmer chromite and manganese prices. 

 "I fully anticipate that we'll emulate our 2002 result when we made A$14.1 million," he said.

Q: I HAVE read about employers closing final salary pension schemes and am myself a member of my employer's scheme. Why are employers doing this? A: A final salary pension scheme provides a pension based on your years of service and your salary at the date you retire.    

Usually the amount you earn is based on a fraction, for example one sixtieth of your final salary for each year you worked for a company. If you worked for an employer for 20 years you would receive 20/60ths - or in other words one third - of your final salary.    

In addition these types of pensions tend to provide for a spouse should you die. The pension will also increase each year to counteract inflation.    

You are therefore being given a promise of an excellent pension. But with falling stock markets, the costs of providing such a marvellous pension are becoming higher on employers.    

Many pension funds have large deficits, which employers are having to make up.    

There has been much publicity about people not getting their promised pension when their employer went into liquidation.    

On June 11, the Government proposed a compensation fund to meet any shortfall in a pension fund in the event of a company going bust.    

This is good news but still doesn't help solvent employers who are finding the cost of their pension schemes too much to bear and are either closing their schemes or making cost-saving alterations to them.    

At the moment count yourself very lucky to be a member of such a scheme, but don't be surprised if some change is proposed in future.    

Q: I HAVE held an investment bond for five years and understand I can take five per cent as income, tax free. Is this correct? You are able to withdraw five per cent of your original investment each year, but the amount withdrawn is treated as a partial return of the original capital, rather than income.    

A: You are also able to withdraw any unused annual allowances, so for example you could now withdraw 25 per cent, as you have held the bond for five years.    

Any withdrawals are added to the increase in the value of the bond when assessing the amount of gain which may be taxable.    

The life assurance company pays an amount to meet any basic rate tax and capital gains tax due.    

But there are two potential problems.    

The first is the possible loss of your tax age allowance if you are over the age of 65.    

The second is a possible tax bill of 18 per cent if you are a higher rate tax-payer. This is the difference between the 22 per cent tax the life insurance firm has paid for you and the 40 per cent tax rate you must pay as a higher earner.    

The bonds have fantastic tax advantages, but careful planning on encashment and withdrawals is needed to make full use of them.

I want to build a timber-frame home, and finish it off with a new thatched roof to create a more authentic look. How easy is it to source thatch, is it expensive and what are the building regulations?

EU, Dorset

The good news is that in the Dorset area, many new houses are being built with thatched roofs. So, getting planning permission should not be a problem. If you decide to build your house in another area, though, you will have to check with your local planning department to find out whether they have any particular stipulations.

In theory, if a thatch is in keeping with the surroundings, then it should be acceptable. If it's not, then this could be a contentious issue and one you may have to fight for. If you choose to build in a conservation area and all the buildings have thatched roofs, then your home will be required to have one, too.

On the other hand, if the conservation area doesn't have any houses with thatched roofs, it is extremely unlikely that your new build will be allowed to have one.

Also watch out for the height of the roof. It will need to have a steep pitch, which may mean your roof line is higher than normal and out of keeping with the local environment as a result.

If you get the go-ahead, the pitch of the roof will be steeper than average 45 degrees is the minimum, although some thatchers prefer 50 degrees. You should also ensure that the straw or reed to be used is in keeping with the local area.

Watch out, too, for the quality of the material as this will effect its durability, especially if your home will be particularly susceptible to weathering - if, for example, it is at the top of a cliff. If you choose well, the roof should not need replacing for between 30 and 50 years.

As far as building regulations are concerned, thatched roofs are treated no differently to normal roofs. However, because of the recent increase in their popularity and the variation in the durability of materials used, the National House Building Council (NHBC) has decided to review the regulations covering thatched roofs. So, if you do decide to go ahead with a thatched roof then it is sensible to check with the NHBC (01494 434 477, www.nhbc.co.uk ) nearer the time to find out what the new rules will be.

To find a thatcher in your area, download the list on the National Society of Master Thatchers website ( www.nsmt.co.uk ).

 Super funds take hammering.

 ONE in four Australians will again lose money on their retirement savings this financial year. 

 Of Australia's eight million workers, six million people can expect a positive return of between 1.5 per cent and 4 per cent if they invested in a large industry fund or public sector superannuation fund. 

 About two million people, however, will be disappointed by their annual return because many have invested in retail superannuation funds, which were hammered on the sharemarket last year. 

 The average return for these super funds, mainly sold by banks and financial institutions, was a tough minus 2 per cent. 

 Only a quarter of retail funds was expected to deliver a positive return this year - the best of which was only 3 per cent. 

 Nevertheless, Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia chief executive Philippa Smith said this was an improvement on the poor 2001-02 superannuation returns. 

 "It's important to remember that these (retail) funds account for a minority of Australians," Ms Smith said. "Happily, the majority of workers - up to 70 per cent - can look forward to a positive return on their statement for 2002-03." 

 But Australia is heading for a superannuation crisis - our savings accounts are going backwards as our debt goes up and many of today's baby boomers will not have enough to retire. 

 Research by the National Centre for Economic Modelling found that if the youngest Australian baby boomer - that is today's 39-year olds - want to retire early they would have to live on an income of $10,000 a year. 

 For a woman of the same age - likely to earn less and take time out to have a family - her retirement income is likely to be $5300 a year. The Government's age pension is $11,000 a year. 

 Financial planners suggest people need about 60 to 70 per cent of the annual pre-retirement income to be "comfortable" in retirement - that means about $25,000 to $30,000 in retirement for a male on today's average earnings. 

 "Putting it another way, superannuation alone will not support early retirement even in 2020," the report said. 

 The savings crisis appears to have spread even wider than the baby boomer generation. 

 With interest rates at record low levels, Australians are instead "living for today" by racking up debt and spending their saving. 

 In the six months to March this year, Australian households' savings plunged into negative territory to minus .5 per cent of Australia's economic output. 

 According to Australian Bureau of Statistics statisticians, this is the first time it has happened since records began.

 $6.9b in super contributions 'goes missing'.

 MORE than 2.74 million Australians have 'lost' some or all of their retirement savings. 

 The reason is usually due to the simple fact that they forget to consolidate their superannuation when changing jobs or employers. 

 This can be a particular issue for women who often have small and multiple superannuation accounts due to changing employers after having children or returning to the workforce on a casual and/or temporary basis. 

 According to a recent report, 36 per cent of working mothers are now utilising flexible working arrangements such as part-time work and job-sharing. 

 Meanwhile, the total amount of 'lost' superannuation has now reached a staggering $6.9 billion at a time when many people are discovering they don't have enough superannuation to support them throughout their retirement years. 

 Many people know they have additional super 'somewhere' but haven't got around to actively transferring it. 

 Instead, they continue to receive three or four sets of superannuation reports and only make the effort to quickly glance at their balance. 

 According to Shaun Williams, Norwich Union Australia's general manager for group product distribution, this is bad news for members of superannuation funds. 

 "With the downturn in investment markets it really is time for all of us to get our individual finances in the best shape possible. We need to make the most of what we have and try to minimise exposure to any outside influences." 

 And for many, one of the first things to consider organising is superannuation. 

 "If a bank account had suddenly disappeared you would definitely be asking questions about your funds. 

 "Well the same thing should apply with superannuation. It is your money and you should take responsibility for it by investing it all in one account, ensuring your total investment works for you," said Mr Williams. 

 "In these times of uncertainty, it is frustrating enough for our superannuation balances to suffer from negative returns, but to be hit by multiple fees is a definite double blow." 

 Administration fees eating away into numerous funds rather than one total balance can also make a significant difference to the sum of your superannuation investment when it comes time to retire. 

 For most people it is not a difficult process to consolidate superannuation funds. 

 Norwich Union, like most funds, offers a simple transfer form to fill out and all you need to know is the details of any funds. 

 An independent financial adviser can assist in streamlining this process and ensuring all funds are best placed for long-term growth. 

 Mr Williams said that through the 1990s the average return on investments was 12 per cent, but those outstanding returns could not be expected in the current climate. 

 N For people who cannot trace old superannuation funds, the Australian Tax Office has a register of lost superannuation money. The Lost Members Register can be contacted on 131 020. 

 'If a bank account had suddenly disappeared you would definitely be asking questions about your funds'.

 Money - `Once women understand money, they do much better than men'.

 TEAPOTS AND toy rabbits are the props for the latest double act to attack the stubbornly wide gap in women's financial knowledge. They are the financial commentator and stand-up comedian Jasmine Birtles and the writer Jane Mack, who have been signed up by the financial website, The Motley Fool (www.fool.co.uk), to run workshops for women in central London. 

 "Women are actually very good at dealing with their money once they get the idea," said Ms Birtles. "It's just that we've had so many centuries of being told `not to worry our pretty little heads about it' that we have a lot of catching up to do. Once women do understand money and investing, though, they actually do better than men." 

 So great is demand that Motley Fool is having to organise a second money makeover for women next month as the first one next week is so over-subscribed. 

 Next Thursday a workshop is being held, called Taking Control of Your Money, which will cover everything from taking control of finances to building up wealth and sorting out the means to a comfortable retirement. But that is already booked up, so a second session on similar lines will be held on 19 June to accommodate the extra demand. 

 "It will be a basic romp through the subject," said Ms Birtles, "from getting out of debt to understanding compound interest - that's where we use the toy rabbits. It's a bit of financial cabaret, really. 

 "Women need to understand money now more than ever. They generally earn about 80 per cent of what men earn, they usually give up their careers and earning power (at least for a few years) to care for children, they tend to lose out from divorce and the divorce rate is rising, and women generally outlive men but they have much less money invested to pay for their future." 

 "At the moment, one in three households is a single person and it's estimated that in 20 years' time more than half of the adult population will be living alone. So any woman who's dreaming that her man will look after her in her old age can dream on!" 

 INFORMATION 

 vTaking Control of Your Money is on Thursday, 19 June 6.30-9pm at The Media Centre, 131-151 Great Titchfield Street, London, W1P 8AE 

 vThe workshop costs £15 and includes a copy of A Girl's Best Friend is her Money, by Jane Mack and Jasmine Birtles (left) (RRP £12.99), and a glass of wine 

 vSend cheques, made out to the Motley Fool, to The Motley Fool, 6th Floor, 3-8 Carburton Street, London W1W 5AJ

 CBO Study: GSE Debt Registration Won't Hurt Mortgage Mkt

 Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- A Congressional Budget Office report released late Tuesday found that requiring Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) to register their debt securities won't prevent consumers from locking in mortgage rates and won't dramatically increase their loan costs, as the companies have long maintained. 

 Mortgage finance companies Fannie and Freddie have used those arguments to successfully resist attempts in Congress to repeal their long-standing exemptions from federal securities registration requirements. Under pressure from lawmakers, the two agreed last July to voluntarily register their common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But they escaped having to also register their preferred stock, mortgage-backed securities and debt to give regulators time to study the issue. The companies then agreed to enhance their MBS information this spring after a joint report by the Treasury Department, SEC and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight found those disclosures to be lacking in several key areas. 

 The new CBO study found that registering Fannie and Freddie's debt would not result in huge administrative fees for the companies since virtually everything can be processed electronically. 

 It also calculated the cost of the additional registration fees, if passed on to consumers, at less than $25 per $200,000 mortgage. 

 The findings breath new life into a bipartisan bill sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Edward Markey, D-Mass., that would repeal the companies' securities exemptions. The two plan to introduce the legislation Wednesday, hoping the CBO's findings quell many in Washington who believe the legislation would disrupt the secondary mortgage markets. 

 "The CBO study shows the dire consequences Fannie and Freddie keep predicting just won't happen," Shays said.    "Requiring these companies to register their securities will have no adverse effects and will only serve to benefit investors in the MBS market." 

 To be sure, Shays and Markey added a new provision to their bill that limits the amount of registration fees the SEC can collect from Fannie and Freddie to no more than 5% of the SEC's registration fee revenue in any given year. That would have come to roughly $16.2 million in 2002, based on the $324 million in fees the SEC collected that year. 

 The legislation would also give the SEC some flexibility in setting special rules for Fannie and Freddie to ensure the registration and new disclosures don't significantly hinder their ability to issue debt. 

 "These are world-class companies that should be held to the world-class disclosure and investor protection requirements of our nation's federal securities laws, including for their mortgage-backed securities," Markey said. 


A Freddie Mac spokeswoman said their disclosures already exceed those
of other private companies. Officials at Fannie Mae said most industry
officials think that debt registration for the companies would disrupt
the secondary mortgage market.

 A Delicate Balance

 Security. The meaning of the word has changed a lot since Sept. 11, and it's changing still with a war in Iraq and the possibility of more terrorist attacks. Americans are looking closely at the things that really matter to them and choosing to spend less time at work and more time with their families and friends.    

 Unfortunately, this new quest for balance in our lives has not spilled over into our portfolios. Just as investors flocked to stocks in the late 1990s, they're now overinvesting in bonds. It will end just as badly.    

 Three years ago, for example, bond funds made up less than 12 percent of all mutual fund assets, according to the Investment Company Institute. Since then, mutual fund investors have steadily moved money out of stocks and into bonds, helping push bonds up to nearly 18 percent of fund assets. Nowhere has investors' craving for a steady stream of interest payments been more apparent than in the market for U.S. Treasurys, the ultimate safe investment. In March, 10-year Treasury bonds hit their highest level in nearly 50 years, chopping yields to 3.56 percent.    

 But investors counting on security are likely to be disappointed. Interest rates would appear to have nowhere to go but up, and that's bad news for bondholders. A one-percentage-point tick up in interest rates, for example, would knock the value of a 10-year Treasury bond to $922 from $1,000, and it would take 18 months of interest payments for your investment to reach the break-even point. A two-percentage-point rise would drive T-bonds to $852, pushing the break-even point out to three years.    

 So much for security.    

 There is a way to avoid the unwise temptation to chase investment trends. As Russell Pearlman explains in "The Game of Risk," on page 87, choosing the right asset allocation -- and sticking to it -- is the surest way to bring security to your portfolio. Our asset-allocation worksheet, devised by Jersey Gilbert, will help you do just that.    

 Yet another aspect of security is our national defense. The end of the Cold War in the early '90s brought dramatic cuts in military spending -- the so-called peace dividend. Now spending is on the rise again, as the U.S. military replaces aging equipment and invests in new weapons systems. This increased spending has nothing to do with Iraq, but rather is of a piece with the historical ebb and flow of military outlays. As Eleanor Laise reports, spending growth is just two years into what has traditionally been a 10-year cycle, yet defense stocks are near eight-year lows. In "Beyond Iraq," on page 98, she examines this controversial sector and finds big opportunities for investors.

 Spending by Consumers Rose As Incomes Gained in March

 WASHINGTON, April 28 -- Americans spent more in March for the second consecutive month, the government reported today, returning to stores after February snowstorms and taking advantage of promotions to buy new vehicles. 

 Household spending gained 0.4 percent last month, to $7.526 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, after rising a revised 0.1 percent in February. Incomes rose 0.4 percent, to $9,158 trillion, after a revised 0.2 percent increase in February. 

 Consumers kept spending even as their confidence slipped to a nine-year low in the run-up to the war in Iraq and as companies delayed investments and cut jobs. Household consumption accounts for 70 percent of gross domestic product. 

 ''The consumer is going to have to support the economy for a while longer until the business sector makes its adjustments,'' said Tim McGee, chief economist at U.S. Trust in New York. ''Productivity growth is causing incomes to grow, and that is supporting spending.'' 

 Wages and salaries jumped 0.5 percent, to $5.126 trillion, helping the increase in incomes. 

 In addition, consumers generated money to support spending by taking advantage of the lowest mortgage rates on record to refinance their home loans and take out cash. 

 The gain in spending was led by the first increase in three months in purchases of durable goods, items made to last at least three years, which rose 1.6 percent in March after falling 1.5 percent in February. Purchases of nondurable goods dropped 0.2 percent after declining 0.7 percent. 

 Spending on services, which make up half the report, decreased 0.1 percent, the first decline in seven months, after being unchanged in February. 

 The personal consumption expenditures index, a measure of inflation watched by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, rose 0.3 percent, suggesting inflation remains under control. 

 While personal spending grew at a 1.4 percent rate in the first quarter, the government reported Friday, business spending fell at a 4.2 percent pace, the ninth decline in the last 10 quarters. 

 Auto sales, buoyed by price promotions, helped lift spending last month. Automakers spent $3,268 a vehicle on incentives in March, up 1.4 percent from February, according to CNW Marketing Research. 

 In today's report, the personal savings rate fell to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent in February. The indicator weighs current income from wages, salaries, businesses and government payments against spending. It does not account for borrowed money, income from investments, or withdrawals from prior savings.

 Daughter may face tax bill.

 Q I HAVE made provision in my will to leave an investment property to my daughter. She would not have the ready cash to pay capital gains tax. Are there options to make this bequest without causing her money worries? A AN asset that forms part of a deceased's estate and which passes to the deceased's legal personal representative or a beneficiary is deemed to be acquired by the legal personal representative or beneficiary at the date of death. 

 Such an asset will not generally be subject to CGT until sold by the legal personal representative or beneficiary. 

 Therefore, your daughter will not be liable for CGT until she disposes of the property and one would assume such a sale would provide the cash to meet any CGT liability. 

 In your case, your daughter will be deemed to have acquired the investment property on the date of your death. Consequently, a CGT liability could arise on the disposal of this asset by your daughter in the future. 

 Whether the asset was bought before or after September, 1985, will affect its cost base for future CGT assessability and, ultimately, affect the CGT payable. 

 If you acquired the property before September 20, 1985, the cost base for your daughter will be deemed to be the market value at the date of your death. 

 Under this scenario, your daughter will be deemed to have acquired the property at the date of your death. Consequently, sale of the asset within 12 months of your death would preclude access to the discount method (which allows the nominal gain to be reduced by 50 per cent before tax is levied) of CGT calculation. 

 On the other hand, if you acquired the property on or after September 20, 1985, your daughter will be deemed to have acquired the property at the same cost base applicable to you. 

 If an asset bought on or after September 20, 1985, is then sold by the legal personal representative or the beneficiary within 12 months of the deceased's acquisition, the discount method of CGT calculation, again, will not be available. 

 Note that where the beneficiary is a non-resident, an exempt entity or a superannuation fund, then the deceased will be deemed to have disposed of the asset at the date of death and there may be a capital gain to be included in the final return of the deceased taxpayer. 

 CGT legislation can be very complex and your actual position should be confirmed with your taxation adviser.

 Miss H B from Backworth writes: Next month I will be starting a new job and the firm I'm joining will be starting a company pension scheme in August/ September. How do I go about joining the scheme? 

 Answer: Membership of a scheme is usually open to all full-time employees. The minimum age is usually 18 or 21 but normally a set period of employment has to be completed. This can be six months to one year. If you are eligible to join, your employer must give you basic information. Make sure it is an occupational scheme and not a stakeholder pension, which is different. 

 Mr and Mrs A L from Benton write: I am 58 and my wife is 56. We have been thinking about arranging long-term care insurance. Do you think we are at the right age to take out this insurance and do you know if the policy will pay for care in our own home? 

 Answer: The cost of long-term care insurance increases with age, so the sooner you arrange it, the cheaper it is. People who start at 55 rather than 65 could find monthly premiums almost halved. Most policies meet the cost of care whether you are in a residential or nursing home or in your own home. Your adviser will guide you and explain what your policy covers. 

 Mrs J W from Whitley Bay writes: My husband died in the early 1980s and the mortgage on our home was paid off from a joint life policy. I would now like to raise some money against the security of the house and a friend of mine says that she and her husband obtained a roll-up mortgage. Can you tell me how they work before I approach a building society? 

 Answer: With a roll-up mortgage you take out a fixed or capped-rate mortgage on a proportion of your property's value. You will not pay interest on the loan during your life but interest is added to the money you borrow and will "roll-up". The mortgage lender will reclaim its loan plus interest when you die or move into a nursing or residential home. 

 The big advantage of the roll-up mortgage compared with, say, a reversion scheme is that your home is still your own. The disadvantage is the interest rolling up under the loan. I would strongly recommend that you speak to an independent mortgage adviser, who will take you through the various plans on offer and this will allow you to choose the most appropriate and decide between taking either a lump sum or regular income.

 `A GREAT deal of my time is spent in complex tax planning and transaction work," says Chadwick Headof Tax,Mike Hodges. "But it is amazing how often the `bread and butter' tax planning questions areoverlooked." 

 Question: If I sold the company tomorrow, what rate of tax wouldI pay on the gain? 

 Answer: "As little as 10pcbut as much as 32pc. If you sell your company after this April 5 and make again of £500,000 you could be as much as £110,000 better off,depending on whether you have planned to make sure you get business asset taper relief." 

 Question: Someone has told me that my post code could affect my tax bill,can you explain why? 

 Answer: "They a reabsolutely right. Iffor example you are thinking of moving your business to larger premises just down the road and are paying, say, £500,001for the new building, the answer could save you £20,000,if the post code of the new property means it is in a disadvantagedarea." 

 Question: What is the best way to take money out of the company so that. I pay as little tax as possible? 

 Answer: "From this April, when NI rates go up,if you want £10,000 in your hand out of your company and take a little care to make the right choice between extra salary or adividend, you could make sure you a reover £2,000 better off." 

 Question: We do a lot of clever research and development; can we get tax relief on this? 

 Answer: "Yes indeed. Did you know that the tax man will give you a deduction for more than you actually spend? For small and medium sized businesses, the corporation tax relief is £1.50 for every £1 you spend." 

 Question: As an employer,I need to start thinking about this year's pay rises. Is there anything from a tax perspective that. I shouldbeconsidering? Answer: "If you are an employer and give,for example,an employee with a wife and two children, earning £20,000 a year a pay rise of £1,000 a year,he may receive as little as £25 a month extra after the effects of income tax, National Insurance and the reduction in child tax credits. For a higher rate tax payer in the same position, the net increase will be just over £18amonth."Question: In the event of the worst happening, I'm not sure that I've made adequate provision for my family. How bigacheque would the tax man be expecting? 

 Answer: "At a very basiclevel,if youhavean estate of £500,000 anddon't do some fairly straight-forward planning, you could end up paying the tax man £100,000." 

 The overallmessageis very simple; never be afraid to ask the basic questions. They might just save you a lot of money.

 Corus To Ax Thousands Of Jobs In Restructuring - Reports

 LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Steelmaker Corus Group PLC (CGA) is preparing a restructuring plan of its U.K. operations which will involve thousands of jobs losses, millions of pounds of asset sales and a possible rights issue, The Sunday Times reports. 

 The newspaper said the Anglo-Dutch company is also expected to review its binational corporate structure. 

 Citing un-named "top shareholders," The Sunday Times reported they would refuse to inject money unless the role of the Dutch supervisory board was curtailed. 

 Investors fear Corus' banks will refuse to co-operate over new loans unless fresh equity is forthcoming, the newspaper said, adding that union sources believe up to 4,000 jobs could be lost over two or three years. 

 The Observer reports Corus is planning 4,000 further job cuts as part of a restructuring plan which is likely to see the closure or sale of its Teeside plant at Redcar. 

 The newspaper said the figure was disclosed by senior Corus executives as part of negotiations with banks over the extension of a GBP1.4 billion credit facility which expires next year. 

 Corus is also considering the sale of its rails business, and its high quality plate production in Alambama as part of its plan to raise cash and bring U.K. operations back to profitability, the newspaper added. 

 A Corus spokesman said the jobs figures mentioned in the press reports were speculation, as were the assets mentioned for possible sale. 

 The Sunday Telegraph reports David James is being sounded out about taking the helm at Corus. Citing executives close to Corus, the newspaper said James is due to meet with the company next week. 

 Corus' chief executive resigned Friday, as the company reported a 2002 net loss of GBP458 million one day after a Dutch court said Corus couldn't complete a much-needed deal to sell aluminum assets. 

 The Anglo-Dutch steel maker named Stuart Pettifor, the board member responsible for cutting costs and boosting revenue at the unprofitable U.K. business, as the chief operating officer while it searches for a new chief executive. 

 The Corus spokesman said while the company is keen to resolve the matter as soon as possible, there was no foundation to the report of James being sounded out. 

 Friday, Corus also scaled back its optimism about extending a credit facility which expires in January. The company's chairman, Brian Moffat, said the company won't be liquidated and won't demerge the profitable Dutch operation, a scenario raised by the court case in Amsterdam. 

 He said Corus would need to turn to debt or equity markets for additional funding, but said the timing of such a request would depend on how fast the company puts together a plan for the further restructuring of its U.K. business.

Your guide to saving money in tough times

Taking stock of what you earn and where it goes is the first step towards better controlling how quickly it goes.

Against a slowing economy, plunging stockmarkets and uncertainty about a possible war and its consequences, many investors must feel they have little control over their finances. Consumers are still spending heavily on their credit cards and, thanks to rising house prices, seeing more of their income go towards home loans.

Now, more than ever, it's time to tighten our belts and to hold a personal audit on spending. Just as investors in the stockmarket are refocusing on the fundamentals, it's time to go back to basics in household budgeting as well.

In this Smart Money guide to cutting costs, our experts look at how to save on your bank accounts, mortgage, travel, groceries, energy bills, car and broking expenses. Look after the cents, to stretch the maxim, and the dollars will look after themselves.

Because no matter how much you earn, budgeting is essential to any long-term plan and, when the going gets tough, simply keeping your head above water.

As Marisa Broome, principal of boutique financial planning firm wealthadvice, points out, the more you earn, the more you get used to spending. She cites the example of two clients who together earned $400,000. Even though the couple's earnings were terrific, they came to Broome with no assets, only debt. "They were doing everything wrong by spending everything they earned," she says. "We got them to live on one salary and invest the rest in short-term savings, super and medium-term savings and they now have a share portfolio and they've also bought a home.

"It's easy to lift your lifestyle every time you get a pay rise. But people need to tighten their belts, even if it's just to understand where their money is going. So when times get tough, they know where they can pull back."

The biggest sign that investors are looking for more certainty is in the flight to property, says Catherine Wolthuizen, the Australian Consumers Association's finance policy officer. "Consumers are more cautious," she says. "They're conscious of international events as well as the market downturn, and they've turned to more traditional bricks and mortar which they feel have appreciated in value as opposed to managed funds."

Savings goals are crucial, Wolthuizen says, along with the ability to allow for discretionary spending. "It's important to watch out for unintended spending by maintaining strict controls over your personal budget. And it's just as important to look out for other drains on your finance, like paying too much in bank fees or credit card interest, because they will eat through any savings you've made with the best of intentions." Online accounts, such as those offered by ING and HSBC, can be a good way of "quarantining" money from yourself, she says.

 Personal Finance - Buy-to-let loans soar as more people turn to property possibilities. 

504 words

 Buy-to-let mortgage lending rose by 22 per cent in the second half of 2002 as stock market volatility led to more people investing in property. 

 Advances totalled £6.7 billion in the six months to the end of December compared with £5.5 billion in the first half of the year and £4.1 billion in the second half of 2001. 

 But the Council of Mortgage Lenders said that despite the rise in lending, arrears had actually fallen. 

 During the six months only 0.42 per cent of people with a buy-to-let loan were at least three months in arrears, down from 0.5 per cent the previous half and 0.55 in 2001. 

 The CML said that this compared with about one per cent of people who were in arrears across the whole mortgage market. 

 On average, lenders would not advance more than 80 per cent of the value of a property - the same proportion as two years ago. They also required rents to be at least 130 per cent of monthly mortgage repayments, a level which has remained the same since the CML first started collecting buy-to-let figures in 1998. 

 At the end of 2002 there were around 275,500 buy-to-let mortgages, worth £24.2 billion, and accounting for around 3.5 per cent of all residential lending. 

 CML director general Michael Coogan said: 'Buy-to-let lending is often portrayed as more risky and prone to market shocks than mainstream lending. 

 'But our figures show the opposite - that lenders are maintaining conservative lending strategies and experiencing very low default rates.' The CML's findings were underlined by Solihull-based buy-to-let specialist lender Paragon Mortgages who said its latest market snapshot showed that lending remained at comfortable levels to property valuations and so should ease concerns that landlords are becoming financially stretched. 

 'Despite what some people have been saying, the buy-to-let sector looks in pretty good shape,' said Paragon Mortgages managing director John Heron. 'Landlords' gearing levels are still very reasonable - and getting lower - and their confidence for the future is good, with more than a third expecting to grow their portfolios over the next 12 months.' 

 Meanwhile, research from the Association of Residential Letting Agents said its members were optimistic that rents had stabilised during the three months to the end of February, with 58 per cent of members saying they had either stayed the same or risen. 

 The balance of supply and demand also appears to be improving, with 56 per cent of ARLA members saying they thought there were more properties than tenants. This compares with November when 66 per cent believed there was an oversupply. 

 John Crossley, chairman of ARLA, said: 'There seems to be an overall return to balanced supply and demand as a result of traditional growth in the rental market that always appears when house price growth slows down.'.

 Legal and Finance - Agency changes to help child maintenance.

 The way in which child maintenance is assessed, collected and enforced by the Child Support Agency has completely changed. 

 This week a new system became operational intended to make it easier for parents to understand and easier for the Agency to calculate maintenance and enforce payment. 

 The Child Support Act came into force in April 1993 and has been subject to heavy criticism for years. 

 Tania Derrett Smith, an associate within the Birmingham matrimonial team of law firm Challinors Lyon Clark, said the new formula appeared straight forward at first glance. 

 She said: 'The amount of maintenance due will be based on the non-resident parent's net income. This is income after tax, National Insurance and all pension contributions have been deducted.' 

 For a non-resident parent with an income of £200 per week or more, the rates are: 15 per cent of net income for one child; 20 per cent of net income for two children; and 25 per cent of net income for three or more children The calculation will not take account of the income of the parent with care, the income of either parent's partner and the housing or travel to work costs. Previously these factors were taken into consideration. 

 Ms Smith said: 'Although the formula itself appears quite straightforward, there are many other factors which can affect that level of maintenance being paid. 

 'If the non-resident parent has other children living in his household, then they are seen as taking the first slice of his income. For example, if his net income is £500 per week he could expect to pay £75 to his child. If he cohabits with a woman whose two children live with her then the first 20 per cent of this income goes to their support. Accordingly, the Child Support Agency will use only 80 per cent or £400 of his income for assessment purposes. 

 'The Agency can reduce their assessment depending upon the amount of overnight stays the child spends with the nonresident parent. This could have the effect of reducing child support. This could mean that there will be frequent changes to the level of child support if the level of overnight stays changes. 

 She went on: 'The Child Support Agency now has greater powers to deal with parents who refuse to cooperate with it, either in terms of carrying out assessments or enforcing them when parents refuse to pay. 

 'If a parent knowingly gives false information to the Agency or fails to give information when they are demanded to, they are guilty of an offence. They may be liable to a fine or imprisonment. In addition, inspectors may be may enter premises and make such examinations and inquiries 'as they consider appropriate'. 

 'Whilst we broadly welcome these changes, we do have some reservations about the scheme, particularly where the nonresident parent insists on extra contact overnight as a means of reducing his liability for the amount of child support payable.'.

 Investors Demand More Protection As Ahold Scandal Unfolds

 BRUSSELS -(Dow Jones)- European shareholder groups Monday called on the European Union Commission to put in place new safeguards to protect investors in the wake of Royal Ahold NV's (AHO) accounting scandal. 

 Shares in Ahold plunged 60% after the Dutch retailer announced Monday it had overstated earnings by more than $500 million during the past two years. 

 This is the latest in a series of accounting scandals that have mainly hit U.S. companies, such as Enron Corp. (ENE) and WorldCom Inc (X.WCM). 

 "It's naive to think that this is only a U.S. problem. European companies are also overstating earnings. Just look at Ahold," said Peter Paul de Vries, vice president of Euroshareholders, a lobby group that represents shareholders in 23 European countries. De Vries is Dutch, and also heads the VEB, the Dutch shareholder's association. 

 In the wake of the U.S. scandals last year, an E.U. advisory committee made some 20 specific proposals in November, including that companies should make their boards legally responsible for publishing accurate financial results. 

 However, the committee chaired by Jaap Winter, former legal adviser at Unilever NV (UN), stopped short of recommending that Europe adopt a single corporate governance code to replace the 40-odd systems in the E.U., because of divergent legal codes around Europe. 

 The committee proposed relying instead on best practices, hoping that the market would drive down the price of shares in companies that didn't comply. 

 In this context, Euroshareholders called for the establishment of independent audit committees in listed companies. External auditors shouldn't act as consultants to the same company if there is a risk that the objectivity of their audit can be questioned, it says. 

 Moreover, minority shareholders should have more say in hiring and firing members of supervisory boards. Incentives, such as options and bonuses, offered to executives should also be open to greater investor scrutiny, it adds. 

 Euroshareholders presented a 10-point action plan to the European Union Commission Monday. It called for stricter rules for analysts, greater controls over the short-selling of stocks, and more investigative resources for financial crime authorities so that they can crack down on insider trading. 

 Stock exchanges also should smarten up their act. Their supervisory activities must become stricter and more active, Euroshareholders says. And a more effective system of sanctions should be introduced. 

 "Investors have lost faith," de Vries said. "The corporate system failed and financial markets are unable to correct it because the current system of checks and balances doesn't work." 

 Even before Ahold, investors were suffering. Stock prices declined 30%-35% on average last year, while the information technology sector leaders saw their share prices halve. The weakness of the economy has played a part in the decline, but the shareholders association said a lack of public faith in companies has pushed the market down even more.

 Life support for sickly savings.

 Stuffing cash under the mattress has never seemed so attractive. 

 Savings accounts have long been seen as the last bastion for cash, but with inflation at 2.7 per cent it is becoming increasingly difficult for taxpaying savers to earn a real rate of return on their cash. 

 Higher-rate taxpayers need to earn 4.5 per cent before tax on their savings even to break even. 

 Basic rate taxpayers need to find an account that pays 3.38 per cent gross. This month's quarter percent rate cut by the Bank of England will make matters worse. 

 "It has become almost impossible for a higher rate taxpayer to get a real rate of return from an instant access deposit account," says Paul Ilott, independent financial adviser with Bates Investments in Leeds. 

 "Unless you're happy to put your money in a fixed term account you'll be lucky to earn more than the base rate." So where can people on modest incomes put their spare cash? Ilott suggests mini cash Isas. Savers can put away up to £3,000 a year and interest is tax free. 

 Outside tax-free accounts, even non taxpayers will have tax deducted from savings unless they tell their bank or building society. 

 Couples on different tax rates can save by switching cash around. 

 "For example, £60 of earned interest to a higher-rate taxpayer would become £100 to a non-taxpayer at the same level of interest," says Ilott. 

 National Savings bonds and index-linked certificates can also increase returns due to their favourable tax treatment, but rates are low, varying between 2 per cent and 3 per cent gross. 

 Darius McDermott at Chelsea Financial Services says government securities, known as gilts, can pay higher returns than cash at around 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent, but that investors must keep a close eye on rates in case they start to fall. 

 A flexible mortgage that allows you to offset your savings against your borrowing can be another way to save money. 

 In return for receiving no interest - which means no tax - on your savings you pay no interest on the equivalent amount of your mortgage. 

 For a higher-rate taxpayer with one of the leading offset mortgage providers this is equivalent to earning almost 8 per cent gross on savings. For a basic rate taxpayer, the figure is almost 6 per cent. 

 Ilott adds that lump sum investments into guaranteed growth bonds, over two, three or five years, can offer better returns than savings accounts - and may also be beneficial for tax planning. 

 "Higher rate taxpayers can defer their tax liability until the end of the life of the bond," he says. 

 "So someone coming up to retirement can avoid paying the higher rate of tax if they become a lower rate taxpayer after they leave work." LINK: Find the best savings and cash Isa rates. Go to www.thisismoney.co.uk and click on Money Makers.

 Is saving dead? Interest rates are at a 48-year low, the stock market is on its knees, with-profits pay-outs have been slashed and higher-rate taxpayers are losing money just by leaving it on deposit. 

 Stuffing cash under the mattress has never seemed so attractive. Savings accounts have long been seen as the last bastion for cash, but with inflation at 2.7 per cent it is becoming increasingly difficult for taxpaying savers to earn a real rate of return on their cash. 

 Higher-rate taxpayers need to earn 4.5 per cent before tax on their savings even to break even. Basic rate taxpayers need to find an account that pays 3.38 per cent gross.

 Managed Investing 
 Analysts Bet War in Iraq Would Spur Stock Rally

 LONDON -- It is almost an article of faith among fund managers and analysts that stock markets will rally once the shooting starts in Iraq. 

 They take comfort in the precedent established by the last Gulf War, when European shares surged more than 15% between the start of the allied attack Jan. 17, 1991, and the Feb. 26 Iraqi flight from Kuwait. 

 Rolf Elgeti, strategist at Commerzbank, figures that a quick, successful war for the U.S. would offer a good chance of a rebound, albeit a slightly less forceful one than a decade ago. 

 UBS Warburg strategist Ian Harnett is more optimistic, figuring that "the next short-term move for markets may be one of a 10%-15% relief rally similar to those seen in July and October last year." 

 Even some of the market's biggest bears think that a rally will come with a war to oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 

 "We tend to agree with the conventional wisdom that removal of Saddam in one way or another will spark a stock market rally," according to a research note last week from Comstock Partners, which runs some high-profile U.S. bear funds. 

 The consensus is that there will be some sort of bounce if there is a war. Whether such a rally is sustainable is another question. 

 "We doubt that there is enough risk appetite currently to sustain the same type of major rally without seeing some more positive economic news," according to Mr. Harnett's research note. 

 But not everyone is convinced there'll be a rally at all. Kevin Gardiner, a strategist at CSFB who is otherwise positive on the outlook for equity markets, said he thinks the hopes for a war-inspired market jump Iraq could be off the mark. 

 "I feel nervous that if everyone is expecting [a rally] that it won't pan out," he says. 

 Skeptics think that such a strong expectation of a rally should already be priced into the market. After all, any rational investor who thinks shares are going up tomorrow would already be buying today. 

 "Maybe the surprise, the really out-of-consensus outcome, will be that there will be no rally at all," wrote Morgan Stanley economist Eric Chaney, quoting one of his clients in a recent research note. 

 But the rally's defenders say they aren't so sure that a war-inspired surge has been priced into the market. For one thing, a war still isn't certain, and some people are worried that, if a conflict does break out, it won't be a short one. Commerzbank's Mr. Elgeti put the odds of a war at 70%, and just a 50% chance of a quick one. 

 A drawn-out conflict or a failure to resolve the confrontation with Saddam before the summer puts a halt to the potential campaigning season could prove a longer-term drag on the markets.

 Business - Pension worry.

 MONDAY MAGAZINE moneymanager.com.au 

 Q: I am a divorcee, aged 65. Apart from owning my own home, car and contents, I have about $10,000 in the bank. My income is comprised of a Centrelink pension and about $5800 UK pension. Recently, my ex-husband died and left his home to me in his will. This should realise about $300,000. Am I still able to get the age pension? I'm worried I may not continue to receive it. 

 A: Eligibility for the age pension is determined under both an assets test and an income test. Whichever test provides the least benefit is used to determine your level of payment. 

 Once the estate is finalised so that assets can be distributed, the value of the inherited property is assessable. You should advise Centrelink of any potential entitlement. Once assessed, the inheritance will take your assets over $290,500 (the limit for a single home owner) and you will not be entitled to receive any age pension. 

 You may wish to seek financial planning advice on how to invest the proceeds, as some investments can be assets-test exempt. Examples are funeral bonds up to $5000, gifting within specified limits, and certain (complying) annuities. This may help restore a partial pension for you, depending on the interaction with your income test. Other issues to consider are the amount of cash reserves you require for planned and unplanned expenses and your income target, your risk profile and tax-effectiveness of investments. 

 Q: I have superannuation savings of about $400,000. Recently I left the workforce (aged 47) because of illness and am unable to work again. Can I access my superannuation as I have no other means of support? 

 A: I would recommend visiting your nearest Centrelink office to apply for income support. A disability support pension may be payable if you are unable to work for at least the next two years. Eligibility for Centrelink payments is also subject to asset and income testing. For this reason it may be beneficial to leave your money in superannuation which is an exempt investment until you reach age pension age. If you wish to access your superannuation, you need to contact your fund and request a release because of total and permanent disablement. Release is subject to trustee approval and the rules of that fund. 

 Generally you require two doctors to complete medical certificates certifying that because of your illness you are unable to perform work for which you are qualified. If access is approved, you should seek financial planning advice to determine the best strategy for using your superannuation to meet your income needs. RetireInvest strongly suggests that no person should act specifically on the basis of the information but should obtain appropriate professional advice based upon their own circumstances.

 U.S. President's Plan To Raise Spending On AIDS Has Critics

 Washington -- U.S. PRESIDENT George W. Bush's proposal for a huge spending increase to fight AIDS in Africa and the Caribbean is facing skepticism from health activists and the specter of being trumped by the Senate Republican leader and a Democratic presidential aspirant. 

 The president opened himself up to a fight over support for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The independent international body has strong supporters on Capitol Hill and doubters inside the White House. 

 In his State of the Union address, Mr. Bush said he will ask Congress for $10 billion (9.23 billion euros) over five years for AIDS programs in Uganda, Mozambique, Haiti, Guyana and 10 other hard-hit nations, in addition to the $1 billion the U.S. spends in a typical year on international AIDS. 

 The White House will ask for $2 billion for fiscal 2004, a $700 million increase over projected 2003 spending, with bigger increases later. But the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee said it will consider next week an even-more-generous bill sponsored by Majority Leader Bill Frist, a Tennessee Republican, and presidential hopeful Sen. John Kerry. "This isn't the first time this administration has spoken the right language about AIDS, but too often their actions have lagged far behind their photo opportunities," the Massachusetts Democrat said. 

 The Frist-Kerry bill, which passed the Senate last year but died in the U.S. House of Representatives, would authorize as much as $3 billion of spending for 2004. The full Senate is expected to pass it in as little as two weeks. 

 Speaking for the administration, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the president's proposals are "very consistent" with many elements of the Senate bill. 

 AIDS activists, initially pleased by the size of the president's AIDS pledge Tuesday night, were more dubious in the light of day and began pushing the administration to speed delivery of the money, expand the list of eligible countries to include India, China and Russia, and funnel more money though the global fund. 

 The Senate bill would direct about $1.25 billion to the fund, which is fast running through the $2.1 billion it has been promised by nations and foundations world-wide. Mr. Bush is proposing $200 million of annual contributions, a reduction from the $300 million to $400 million that Congress is expected to spend this year. 

 Many major drug makers were caught off guard by the Bush proposal, which would spend half of the increased funding on antiretroviral drugs. Nancy Pekarek, a spokeswoman for GlaxoSmithKline PLC, said while "political will is critically important to fighting the disease, how this particular proposal will work, we don't know." But, she said, she doesn't see a windfall for Glaxo, noting the company sells its important AIDS drugs at no profit in Africa.

THIS WEEK

Flipping the Script: Thinking of buying savings bonds with your credit card to earn frequent-flier miles or cash refunds? Better hurry.

Last week, the Treasury Department doubled the amount of time investors must hang on to their savings bonds to 12 months from six months.

The new rules, which take effect for bonds dated Feb. 1, are designed to keep professional investors from piling into savings bonds instead of vehicles like short-term Treasury bills that throw off much less interest.

But it also thwarts bond-flipping by individuals who buy bonds with their credit cards, sell them six months later, then buy them again to earn more rewards.

Kmart's Next Chapter: The embattled retailer is expected to file its five-year business plan and a reorganization plan with the bankruptcy court. Under the proposed plan, approved in principle by the company's board last Monday, holders of current common stock would receive no value.

In a sign the retailer is moving closer to emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings, Kmart announced that it got a commitment of up to $2 billion in exit financing.

Taxpayers who apply won't face criminal or civil fraud charges but will be expected to pay back taxes, interest and "certain accuracy and delinquency penalties." They'll also have to disclose information about who promoted or solicited the offshore arrangement.

 People who make tax-deductible donations can enjoy the tax saving sooner under changes announced by the government. Employers can now reduce the tax taken out of a worker's pay packet when the employee makes a donation to a deductible gift recipient through regular payroll deductions, rather than waiting to receive their deduction at tax time. 

 The consumer watchdog is on the prowl for complaints about internet shopping over the Christmas and New Year period. "Bargains can be found across the globe however such a vast marketplace can harbour unscrupulous and anonymous traders," says the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. As an example, the ACCC cites the operator of www.sydneyopera.org, a website that purported to be the official booking site for the Sydney Opera House. The ACCC alleges people from the UK and Europe tried to buy tickets through the site on their credit cards and they were either overcharged or did not receive the tickets. 

 A shocking year has left most managed funds in negative territory. Anyone who is not losing money should be thankful. Technology share funds have been the worst performers, generally losing 40-50 per cent of their value. International share funds have been in the second bottom spot. They lost about a quarter of their value. European and other overseas markets are not far behind. After showing remarkable resilience last year, the Australian stock market has plunged leaving Australian share funds down about 10 per cent with a few exceptions. The most conservative of funds - fixed interest and cash funds - generally returned about 5 per cent. The star performers were property funds. Most property funds returned 10-20 per cent. 

 Despite a relatively high growth rate, ethical or socially responsible investments account for just 0.29 per cent of the total investment management market according to Ethical Investor magazine. Ethical investments total $2.1 billion of the $721.3 billion invested in the Australian retail and wholesale investment markets. But ethical investments is one of the fastest-growing segments with an annual growth rate of 28.7 per cent against growth in the total market of just 4.35 per cent. 

 The Commonwealth Bank's holiday tips: Protect the security of your PIN number when using ATMs. Take notice of people around you - if you think you have been followed or observed too closely leave and try a different ATM. If an ATM appears not to be working properly, cancel your transaction before removing your card and tell the ATM's owner. Keep your credit or debit card in sight during a transaction, which should be done in front of you at the EFTPOS terminal (not below the counter or in a back room). If ordering goods by phone be careful giving out your credit card details - ensure you are dealing with legitimate companies.

UPDATE -- RICHARD J. FERRIS

 THE latest crisis at United Airlines is just that: the latest. Over the last 20 years, United has weathered strikes, takeover attempts and management disputes, and there are few who would know more about the difficulty of running United than Richard J. Ferris. 

 Mr. Ferris, who was forced to resign as chief executive of the company in June 1987, spends much of his time these days on golf, playing it and serving as chairman of the Tour Policy Board of the Professional Golfers Association. But in the 1980s, when United was expanding beyond the friendly skies, Mr. Ferris was in the pilots seat. 

 He became chief executive of UAL, Uniteds parent, in 1979, just months after airline deregulation. He had joined the company in 1971 to head its food services after working at Western International, a hotel chain acquired by UAL in 1970. At UAL, he tried to create one-stop travel shopping, acquiring Hertz and Hilton International between 1985 and 1987 and renaming the company Allegis, a name that he now concedes ''sounded like a bad cold.'' 

 The synergy never materialized, however, and in April 1987 an angry pilots union tried to buy the airline from Allegis for $4.5 billion. Allegis was in play, and a group of investors began buying its shares, trying to force a breakup. 

 That attempt was dropped when the Allegis board agreed to restructure the company, and Mr. Ferris resigned that June. Both Hilton and Hertz were sold. In 1988, the companys name was once more UAL. 

 Mr. Ferris continued to focus on travel. In 1992, he and Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, acquired Guest Quarters Hotels, a northeastern chain, in partnership with General Electric. By 1997, after mergers with Doubletree and the Promus Hotel Corporation, Mr. Ferris left the combined company. 

 Mr. Ferris, now 66, lives in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook and is an outside director on several company boards, including Procter & Gambles. He said that the bankruptcy filing by United would give it the opportunity to face the realities of this century but that he worries about airline consolidation in general. 

 As a golfer, Mr. Ferris plays each year in the pro-am tournament at Pebble Beach and since 1993 has served the P.G.A. as a volunteer. In partnership with Mr. Ueberroth, Clint Eastwood and Arnold Palmer, he bought the Pebble Beach Company, which owns resorts as well as golf courses. ''Its great,'' he said. ''Hotels, golf all the things I love.'' 

 In 1998, he testified against the handicapped golfer Casey Martin, who had sued the P.G.A. to allow him to use a cart in competition. Mr. Martin won, and the two men ended up as partners in the pro-am tournament the next year. According to accounts, the round went smoothly.      CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 Losses all part of investment cycle.

 Q: My investment funds have performed dreadfully in the last year or so. I know I'm not alone but wonder what the best strategy is and how long my funds will remain in the negative? A: Remember that losses are part of the investment process when your investments have exposure to assets that can go up or down in value. But so are recoveries and when markets (particularly sharemarkets) do pick up they can do so quite quickly. Being out of the market and trying to time the best date to re-enter can be tricky. If you have good fund managers and investment assets then now is not the time to abandon your investment strategy. Most of the time the sharemarket makes small losses and gains and 10 to 15 strong days boost the long-term averages. If you are out of the market on these days your returns will suffer. How much you have invested in the market will determine how often you will experience a negative return. 

    If you have a high growth strategy with 75 to 90 per cent in growth assets you could see a negative return one in every five years. A balanced fund with 50 to 60 per cent growth assets will have one loss in six or seven years and conservative investments with 30 per cent in the sharemarket will suffer a small loss one year in eleven. 

 Q: My wife and I hold shares in joint names. I earn about $60,000 and she works part-time and earns about $22,000. Our tax advisor suggests putting all the shares in my wife's name as she pays less tax on dividends. As I am the one who manages the shares and does the buying and selling, would I still be able to do this if I was not officially a joint shareholder? A: If your wife gives you authority to act on her behalf you can still manage the portfolio. If you buy and sell over the Internet then you would need her PIN or if you buy through a broker they would need her authority (probably in writing) for you to act on her behalf. This is similar to giving someone Power of Attorney and provided the investments are held for the benefit of the owner the tax liability would stay with the owner of the shares. A common analogy is where one person in a couple maintains the household bank accounts whether they be joint or individual. The tax liability on the interest is still due by the beneficial owner.

 Mr & Mrs D E from Lynemouth write: We noticed a month or so ago that you answered a letter about Home Income Plans. We want to release some money from our home and have been told to ask about a roll-up mortgage. Can you tell us how these work? 

 Answer: With a roll-up mortgage you would borrow a set amount, either as a lump sum or as a series of regular payments. The maximum you can borrow will depend on your property's value and your ages. 

 You pay no interest on the loan while you are living in the property. Instead the debt simply rolls up. The loan and the accumulated interest are repaid when the house is sold or when you die or go into care. 

 You have to be careful with these types of loans as you cannot determine how much you will be paying back at the end and interest payments can grow quite rapidly. I would strongly recommend you speak to an independent mortgage adviser who will also show you how Home Reversion Schemes and Home Income Plans work. 

 Mr W K from Hexham writes: Currently I have approximately £15,000 saved in banks and building societies, an investment bond, two Peos and a stocks and shares type of Isa. 

 Because I am now a higher rate tax payer, I want to transfer most of the money in the bank and building societies to my wife. She is a lower rate tax payer. 

 What is the limit I am allowed to transfer every tax year? 

 Answer: There is no limit in your case. When transferring money between husband and wife there is no income tax or capital gains tax to pay. 

 You also need not worry about Inheritance Tax when you are transferring money to your spouse. 

 Remember, that it must be a genuine transfer and not just a cosmetic exercise to avoid paying tax. 

 Mr L W from Penshaw writes: I have a question I would like answering about life cover for fellow directors in a company. I believe the cover is called "key" cover and I need to know if the cover is available on the life of a director rather than just an employee of the company? 

 Answer: Provided the director is a "key" employee whose death would result in the loss of profits cover will be available subject to underwriting. 

 Where the director is also a shareholder in the company, the tax treatment of the policy may be affected. 

 This is a specialist area and you should take advice from an independent financial adviser who deals in this important arena.

Bonds look riskier.

THOUSANDS of savers who have bought into supposedly low-risk funds may not be as safe as they thought, financial advisers are warning. Corporate bond funds, which invest in bonds issued by companies, have been a popular choice this year with savers disillusioned by a downturn on the stock market. Now they too could be heading for a fall.

David Hanratty, of independent financial adviser Nelson Money Managers, warns: "When shares were at an all-time high three years ago it was the wrong time to jump into shares-based funds - it is the same now with bonds and bond funds."

The Investment Management Association says the funds have accounted for 27 per cent of its members' sales this year and have been the biggest seller every month since May.

Such success is not surprising given the way shares have performed over the past three years. Bonds produce less volatile returns than shares and generate reliable income payments.

The funds can also produce long-term capital gains. The average bond fund is up about 5 per cent over the past 12 months compared with a 20 per cent fall in the value of the FTSE 100 index of shares in Britain's largest companies.

However, many bonds look overvalued, which is worrying for people who invest to produce income or to avoid risk.

Alan Wilde, a director of fixed-income investments at Abbey National Asset Managers, says: "There is a bubble developing in the bond market - by any historic valuation they are expensive."

Wilde blames this bubble on pension fund managers who have moved billions of pounds out of shares and into bonds to protect their returns. This flight to safety has pushed up the price of all bonds - including government-issued gilts - to an artificial high. As a result, experts say there is a real risk that funds could begin losing money as bond prices fall to more realistic levels. And if history repeats itself, the correction could be drastic.

In February 1994 an unexpected interest rate cut in the US sent UK bond prices tumbling by up to 30 per cent over the subsequent few months. The effect on UK bond funds was disastrous - at one fund savers lost almost 50 per cent of their money.

Hanratty says: "At that time funds offering higher incomes were hit hardest and, worryingly, it is the same kind of fund that is attracting a lot of money at the moment."

Such a fall, says Wilde, could be sparked by a sustained shares recovery, evidence of growth in the global economy, or an increase in interest rates in either the UK or the US.

Wilde adds: "I don't know if the bubble will pop but I do think air will escape and some of the bond funds that have done very well will lose some of the capital gains they have made."

Not all advisers are so negative about bonds' prospects but even those still tipping funds advise caution.

 'Tis the season to be prudent.

 If you have been making extra repayments on your mortgage over the past year, congratulate yourself. Just about everyone would like to make extra payments but too often the balance between fiscal responsibility and lifestyle goes against doing the right thing by your home loan. 

 But those who have made extra repayments and have a redraw facility attached to their loans face a tempting proposition now Christmas is approaching. 

 Although a redraw facility lets you make additional payments above your standard repayment, it also lets you withdraw the surplus funds you have acquired when the need arises. 

 With presents to buy, the silly season to celebrate and holidays to enjoy, the temptation is to undo all the gains you've made and blow the lot. 

 It's times like these you should remind yourself of the benefits of being responsible. Extra payments reduce the principal amount and interest payable. 

 According to Nicholas Humphrey, author of The 2003 Penguin Australian Home Buyer's Guide, if you make normal repayments at 7.5 per cent, it will take 26 years to repay $200,000. 

 Making an extra repayment of $21 a month saves you a whole year or $11,504. An extra repayment of $130 a month shaves five years off your loan or $55,689. 

 As Sulinna Org at consumer group InfoChoice puts it, if you have a home loan at 7 per cent, every extra dollar you pay off the principal is another dollar you are not paying 7 per cent on each year. "If you instead put that extra dollar into a savings account you are only going to earn 2 or 3, perhaps 5 per cent at the most." 

 The Mortgage Store managing director Glenn Maynard says the first few years of your loan are made up mainly of interest payments. "Any accelerated repayments in the first few years make a dramatic difference over the life of a loan," Maynard says. 

 Redrawing the extra repayments you've made reduces the benefits you were getting, but doesn't entirely undo the gains you made during the year. 

 "If you need the money, you need the money," Maynard says, adding that it's better to take it out of the loan than use a credit card to pay for your expenses over Christmas, which could leave you with a debt on which you are paying 18 per cent interest. 

 Some lenders are anticipating the rush to redraw money over Christmas, making it easier to reduce the impact on your loan. The Commonwealth Bank has reduced the minimum amount of extra payments that homebuyers can draw back from their home loans to $500 until February. 

 Usually, the minimum is $2000 to $5000, depending on which Commonwealth Bank loan you have. 

 Tips for success Try not to redraw from your home loan over Christmas If you do need money, redraw from your home loan rather than accrue credit card debt Be aware of minimum redraws and fees.

 A weekly column on the legal aspects of money, and the problems it can bring, by FENTON BRESLER 

 R. B. B. writes: My wife and I live in a bungalow that has been valued at £250,000. We are joint owners with equal shares. I am 72 and my wife is 70. 

 In the event of us both dying, the house will be sold and the proceeds divided between our three children. 

 What is causing us concern is this - when the first one of us dies, will the remaining spouse be liable for taxation? Can you advise us on what we should do? 

 F. B. replies: My postbag tells me that this is a problem that worries many older readers. 

 Only the rich used to be concerned about what were called death duties. But recently, with the boom in house prices and 40 per cent inheritance tax (IHT) charged on estates over £250,000, this has become an increasing problem for middle England, where the home is, generally, a couple's biggest asset. Yet I think I can help. 

 Before we start we must get one thing out of the way. I am not sure what you mean by saying you and your wife are 'joint owners having equal shares'. With respect, that is not quite right. 

 There are two ways of jointly owning property: joint tenancy and tenancy in common. Like most married couples and unmarried permanent partners, you and your wife have probably chosen to be joint tenants - but you should not talk about 'equal shares'. 

 You both own the whole property, not merely a share. I am not being pedantic - there is a fundamental difference. 

 Because you both own the whole bungalow, when the first joint tenant dies, there is no need for a will. The other automatically becomes sole owner and, in your case, IHT does not arise. 

 THAT is because IHT does not apply to married couples, though it does to unmarried partners. 

 Tenancy in common is where each owns a share - not necessarily equal - of the property. This is preferable for temporary arrangements, as when working women buy a flat together. 

 If one dies early, the other does not automatically become sole owner. 

 Someone inherits the dead person's share. If, as I suspect, you and your wife are joint tenants, you should ask your solicitor immediately to make you tenants in common - with each one owning an equal share worth £125,000 of the bungalow. This should cost very little. 

 You should then make new wills, each leaving your newly acquired equal share to be divided between your three children. When the first one of you dies, your children can inherit that share, with the first £250,000 tax-free. 

 Then they can do the same again, when the other parent dies. Result: depending on the value of the estate, your children escape paying IHT, or at least pay less of it.

Take care not to lose interest in an instant - Savings.

Easy access may come at a hefty price, says Mark Atherton

INSTANT-ACCESS savings accounts that top the best-buy tables might not be all they seem, a leading firm of independent financial advisers has given warning.

Chase de Vere says that savers need to be wary of headline-grabbing rates that come with a catch: make a couple of withdrawals and the interest rate falls, sometimes sharply.

Cahoot, the online arm of Abbey National, has recently launched a market leading internet account that pays 4.3 per cent with instant access. But if savers make just one withdrawal from the account, the interest rate for that month falls to a much less attractive annual rate of 3.9 per cent.

Birmingham Midshires, now part of the Halifax group of companies, has a new instant-access account operated by telephone, Telephone Plus. It pays a rate of 4.2 per cent on sums of £5,000 or more. Although it is promoted as an easy access account, savers are penalised if they make more than two withdrawals a year.

Those who make three withdrawals or more are moved to the rate offered by a lower-paying account, Telephone Easy Access. This pays a less attractive 3.5 per cent on £5,000 and 3.7 per cent on £50,000 or more.

For those who want genuine instant access with no restrictions, Chase de Vere recommends Newcastle Building Society's Net Savings account, which is restricted to the internet and pays 4.1 per cent on sums of £1,000 or more and 4.25 per cent on £10,000-plus.

Another high-interest account with no restrictions is egg's internet tracker, which pays 4 per cent with instant access on £1 or more. The account guarantees to match the base rate until 2007.

Although the Bank of England left the base rate unchanged in October, banks are continuing to cut the amount paid to savers. Last week Abbey National trimmed the interest on 11 of its accounts by up to 0.25 percentage points. The rate paid on sums of £3,000 to £5,999 in its Postal Isa dropped from 4 per cent to 3.75 per cent.

Bristol & West has reduced the rate on its Postal Easy Access Plus account by 0.25 points to 3 per cent.

Anna Bowes, savings director at Chase de Vere, says: "Savers need to be aware of the terms of their accounts. Some are not as good as they appear for those making withdrawals."

It is understood that the new Banking Code, due to be published in January and coming into force in March, will require financial groups to inform savers when they alter rates in a way that is unfavourable compared with movements in the base rate.

 10 Funds for the Next 10 Years

 Are there funds you can hold on to for years, with managers who've prospered even when the market has nose-dived? Yes. But they're not so simple to find. Here are 10 that could make your retirement easier to afford. 

 It's frustrating being a 401(k) investor. All too often, the funds you really want to invest in aren't available in your plan. You know, the good funds -- the ones with chart-topping track records, committed management and long-term investing outlooks. But that's okay. To get them, you'll just have to go outside of your 401(k) -- to your IRA, Roth or your regular brokerage account. 

 We set out to find the best funds for retirement savings that were still open to new investors. We began by focusing on those that beat the market over time, not just during the halcyon days of the late '90s. If a portfolio didn't have at least a 10-year record, we didn't even consider it. And since we didn't want any young turks taking credit for past performance, we tossed out any portfolio that didn't have the same manager in place for at least the past five years. That left us with 193 domestic equity funds. 

 Then we scrutinized performance re cords, scuttling funds that regularly suffered deep setbacks or have taken a big hit lately. (It's the main reason Legg Mason Value's Bill Miller didn't make our list.) Finally, we assessed management teams, giving points to those funds with succession plans and those that could hold on to their star managers with strong incentives, such as ownership. 

 The top fund we turned up, at least in sheer performance, was Vanguard Health Care, a sector fund run by Wellington Management's Ed Owens. In fact, it's beaten all but one fund during the past 10 years. (That fund, Fidelity Select Electronics, was disqualified from our screen because of a recent management change.) It's a heady record, and the fund has a heady minimum investment: $25,000. 

 The Clipper Fund, the second-best long-term performer on this list, is a value stalwart that investors abandoned in droves during the tech boom. Manager Jim Gipson and his team held fast to their investing style, though, and the fund has gained more than 45 percent since the start of 2000 -- beating the S&P 500 by more than 83 percentage points. 

 Mairs & Power Growth, our third-place fund, combines small and midcap Minnesota companies with large-cap picks from around the country. While 74-year-old manager George Mairs will continue to run the firm, he plans to turn over the fund's reins to co-manager Bill Frels at the end of 2003. We're comfortable Frels will continue Mairs's superb record, but we'll be keeping an eye on it nonetheless -- as one should with any investment.

 3 Whether entrepreneurs start their businesses in good times or bad, they have one thing in common: They need funding. 

 When launching start-ups, they can turn to angels (independent backers), banks and small business investment companies, venture capitalists, family members or friends. 

 For small start-ups, angels are among the best funding sources, says entrepreneur Lou Pearlman, who heads the entertainment and aviation conglomerate Trans Continental Cos. 

 When scouting for an angel, consider these tips, Pearlman says. 

 Look for one who knows the territory. Your best bet? Successful entrepreneurs - preferably in your field, Pearlman writes in "Bands, Brands and Billions." Get expert accounting and legal advice. "It may seem like a costly expense now, but a smart, tough lawyer and an experienced accountant may well save you from losing your business later," he said. 

 Don't sell your controlling interest. Dishonest backers might seek a majority stake to make a power grab once the business is up and running. 

 Borrowing results in fewer hassles than selling shares, Pearlman said. If you do parcel shares, keep your majority stake at all costs. 

 Before signing, do a background check. Ask for names of the businesses the backer has either invested in or loaned money to, and talk to the company executives. 

 Ask for additional business references. Also do a credit check and contact the Better Business Bureau. 

 If looking for a bank loan, consider these tips. 

 Avoid a wish list. Ask only for the amount you'll need. Ask for too much and you could squelch the deal. 

 Don't wait to be asked. Volunteer "monthly cash flow estimates and quarterly earnings projections for the term of the loan," Pearlman advised. Make sure they're realistic and thorough. 

 Give detailed reasons why you want the loan. Show how you'll use the funds to "increase cash flow, expand the sales force or open up new revenue streams," he said. 

 Make your case. If running a client-based business, your chances of getting a loan will be stronger if you produce signed contracts, he says. 

 If seeking help from friends and family, remember these guidelines. 

 Be honest about the risk. Make sure lenders know the upside potential and the downside. If the person can't afford to lose all he invests, don't ask, Pearlman advises. 

 If they have misgivings, forget it. Find someone who's sold on your idea. 

 Put everything in writing. Prepare a formal contract and make sure the lender's lawyer approves it. 

 For many small start-ups, venture capitalists and small business investment companies are the toughest nuts to crack. It's easier to get funding once your business has a verifiable track record. 

 Venture capitalists are the most selective. Those that fund start-ups look for companies offering high upside potential and a strong return in a relatively short period. 

 The Web site vFinance.com lists investors broken down by industry. When contacting any potential backer, do your homework.

 Get into shape - financially.

 SOMEWHERE along the line, many of us develop attitudes and ideas about money which influence the way we approach and manage our finances. 

 Attitudes and ideas about money can be passed along in very subtle ways and are often inherited from our parents. "We can't afford that." "Do you think we're made of money?" "It's only money." Do any of those sayings sound familiar? But if you are to manage your own finances, it's important to be aware of your money attitude. Let's tackle some familiar excuses. 

 I can't stick to a budget. The word budget is sometimes enough to make people groan. If you've tried budgeting before but failed, chances are your figures were too unrealistic. 

 A budget is not about depriving yourself. It should have the opposite effect. Next time you splurge on a new outfit or an expensive restaurant, a budget will remove any niggling doubts about whether you can afford it or not. 

 You might even reach the stage where you know you've got some savings to invest. 

 I don't have the time. Anyone who has juggled a career, family, or both, knows it can be difficult to set aside time specifically for finances. 

 But if you've got time to watch a video or shop for shoes, then it's likely you can find time to get your finances into better shape. It's important to realise managing your finances does not require a huge amount of time.. 

 You need to be wealthy to invest. Try thinking the other way round, you need to invest to be wealthy. 

 Rather than frittering away your spare cash, try setting up a regular savings plan and aim to save a minimum of 10 per cent of your income. 

 It's possible to invest as little as $100 a month into a managed fund via direct debit, and you may not even miss the money if it's invested directly. Start by setting some goals, and then work out how to achieve them. 

 Super is not my money. Since super is compulsory, and in many cases is paid directly by employers, people find it hard to think of super as their money. 

 But instead of disregarding it, we should consider super as a valuable investment, needed for life after work. In fact, for many Australians, super will grow to be their largest asset, worth more than even the family home, something worthy of a focused investment strategy. 

 There is also confusion between access and control of super. Just because you might not be able to access super now doesn't mean you can't control your super investment. 

 Start considering how to best invest your super, whether you can top up your super with additional contributions, and use available tools such as super calculators to see if you'll have enough to support you in retirement.

The pending sale of Matapiro Station, in New Zealand's famous wine-growing region of Hawkes Bay, could well be the Kiwis' biggest ever private rural deal. The station's chatelaine, Suzanne Shrimpton Dworak-Peck, one of the trustees of the Matapiro Station Trust, has put the 1878-hectare trophy spot on the market hoping to pique the interest of some long pockets. Local agents say the price could nudge over the $17 million mark. Coldwell Banker and David Nolan are taking offers.

CEO of Atakliyan Bros Jewellery, Isa Atakliyan, is selling his four-bedroom Seaforth home, after a completing a quick renovation job. Blessed with views of Sydney's Middle Harbour, the three-level house, built in the late 1940s, is expected to fetch around $1.5 million. Di Jones' Dino Gatti is handling offers.

Famous wanderers Burke and Wills acclimatised their camels at Longerenong Station before their fateful trek. Now the neo-Gothic Wimmera homestead, near Horsham, Victoria, in the hands of the Gregory family for the past 80 years, is up for sale. Elders Horsham and David Falk and Co expect around $1million for the 404-ha property on the banks of the Wimmera River.

Brogheda, the Muswellbrook holding of Scone vigneron, the late Harry Hayes, will be auctioned next weekend. The 1906 NSW homestead once belonged to the Hewitt-Hordern family who established the original larger estate in 1885. The Horderns sold the 83-ha property in 1997 for more than $500,000. Meares & Associates and L.J. Hooker will take bids.

Favourite muso of the jacaranda set, Geoff Harvey, and his wife Katrina are selling their rural retreat, Broomielaw at Berrima, NSW. The 30-ha property, all set about with eucalyptus trees on the banks of the deep brown Shoalhaven River, will be auctioned on November 28. Harvey, who has owned the property for 23 years, has added a rugby field, cricket pitch and a vineyard.

Chris Meares, of Meares & Associates, is taking offers.

Ron Danvers, an international conservation consultant, and Trish Barker, an interior designer, are selling their beautiful Yattalunga property One Tree Hill, near Gawler in South Australia. The 23-room home sits beside a coach house and a 4-ha irrigated olive grove. Fenwick Ennis is expecting offers over $2.1 million.

Paul and Bronwyn Howe have listed Halcyon, their Elanora Heights stately pleasure dome, for sale. The Howes' Xanadu, on Sydney's northern beaches, has 2 ha of manicured gardens plus a pool, tennis court and conservatory. L.J. Hooker Mona Vale is taking offers around the $3 million mark.

Melbournite Jerry Pilarinos is selling up at Coolangatta just as property pundits warn there is no more affordable land on the Gold Coast. Pilarinos's four blocks at Bilinga, with a 64-metre water frontage, should fetch over $12 million. Up the road at Tugan, three blocks on Pacific Parade are expected to sell for $6 million. Prestige Properties, Surfers Paradise is taking offers on both.

 Canberra 

 The Federal Government is to change its $11 billion family tax benefits system to give families greater flexibility to repay surprise debts. This follows criticism for a decision to claw back overpayments from tax refunds. 

 Prime Minister John Howard flagged the move yesterday, appearing to surprise Family and Community Services Minister Amanda Vanstone, who insisted the system was "right" and needed only fine-tuning. 

 Senator Vanstone was unable to say when changes would be made. Last night she was resisting moves to allow families to repay debts gradually from future benefits instead of a lump sum, saying it would be an interest-free loan by the government. 

 Mr Howard's intervention came after concerns were raised by Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson, several Coalition backbenchers, Labor and welfare leaders. 

 Under the system, families must estimate their annual income at the start of the year and inform Centrelink about any pay rise or income change so benefits can be adjusted. 

 But families following the rules have still been hit by debts because Centrelink adjusts future welfare payments but not past payments until the end of the year. 

 Anger at the government has come from the move to recoup the overpayments from tax refunds without giving families advance warning that they have a debt. Some families have reported debts of $4000. Labor's family and community services spokesman, Wayne Swan, said about 700,000 families faced an average debt of $850. Senator Vanstone insisted the debt was less than $500 for most families and said about 400,000 families received top-up payments for understating income. 

 Mr Howard told parliament the problem was caused because Centrelink had not "retro-actively adjusted to capture the overpayment". He said if families were overpaid they had to pay it back "but what we are talking about here is the way in which an overpayment is repaid". 

 Senator Vanstone said: "It is possible for someone to notify Centrelink at the right time and still have an overpayment." 

 Last year the government moved to contain the problem on the eve of the Aston byelection by waiving the first $1000 of any debt and not imposing the tax refund clawback. 

 Senator Vanstone said the overhaul of the system in July, 2000, delivered better, simpler, fairer and more generous family assistance than the former Labor government. 

 Mr Swan said Mr Howard's backdown was an "admission that families who play by the rules are being innocently slugged with massive debts". 

 "Families don't have a crystal ball. The fundamental problem is that they are expected to estimate their income a year in advance. The system is out of step with the work patterns and lifestyles of modern Australian families," he said.

 Advice On Planning Ahead To Help Pay For Children'S Education.

 The average term cost for a private school in Aberdeen is £2,500. 

 Therefore, if a child spends all his or her school life at a private school, the fees alone would cost £130,000. 

 This does not take into account the cost of other school items such as uniforms, books, sports equipment and musical instruments. Therefore, putting your children through private education should not be undertaken lightly. 

 Many people plan well ahead for their children's education. 

 Some are able to pay from income while others need to raise cash because no long-term plans are in place. 

 Whatever your situation, some points to consider include: There are specific school fees plans available and it is wise to start as early as you can to allow you to meet future term costs. These plans can release cash at the start of every school year, and many people start as soon as their child is born. 

 If you are not using your individual savings account (Isa) allowance, consider earmarking this for long-term saving - it is flexible and tax efficient. However, you cannot take out an Isa for a child under 18 - it has to be in an adult's name. 

 Invest a lump sum now specifically to meet future fees. This could be in the form of an accumulation and maintenance trust for children. If possible, ask the grandparents to set it up because, if the parents create the trust, any income paid out for the benefit of the child will be treated as income in the parents' hands and will be liable for income tax. If the grandparents create the trust, income paid out is treated as the children's and their personal allowances will usually mean that the income is tax free. 

 A flexible remortgage may be the answer, which will allow the parents to dip into the mortgage funds to pay the fees as they arise - spreading the costs over a long period. 

 Specific school fees loans are also available on a secured or unsecured basis. 

 Once school is out of way, many parents then face the possibility of putting their child through higher education. Although both of Aberdeen's universities have the highest home-based student populations in the UK, many students still move away and helping them with costs may be a priority. If so, you may consider the following: University bonds, through friendly societies, can be an effective way of setting aside cash. 

 Buying a flat for the student may be an option. This can be done in the son or daughter's name with the parents acting as guarantor. A deposit is useful, but 100% mortgages are readily available. 

 If the property is bought in the child's name, they are the owners and technically it is up to them if and when it is sold.

 Cutting Losses Preserves Confidence And Capital.

 No investor likes admitting he or she's made a mistake. Even a small one. But in the market, putting pride ahead of common sense can cost you money - lots of it. 

 Keeping losses small is the cardinal rule of growth investing. If a stock falls 7% to 8% from your buy point, sell it right away. No excuses, no questions asked. 

 The stock's fundamentals might still look great. It may boast triple-digit earnings growth, have stellar sales and be in a top industry. But an 8% decline from the pivot is a danger sign you can't ignore. 

 Why sell so fast? It's down when you expected it to rise. History shows winning stocks rarely drop 8% from the proper buy point. Many times, a small loss only starts the bleeding. Every 50% plunge begins as an 8% hiccup. Fail to protect yourself, and your portfolio may plunge too. 

 It's much easier to bounce back after small losses. Take a 7% hit on a stock, and you need to gain only 7.5% on your next buy to break even. But a 25% loss requires a 33% gain. Let a stock drop 50% and you'll need a 100% winner to recover. How many stocks double in today's tough market? Minimizing losses preserves not only your capital but also your confidence. Self-doubt creeps in after you suffer a 20% or 30% wallop. You may begin to question your trading skills. The next time a real winner comes along, you may hesitate, and miss out on big gains. 

 Investors fail to sell early for psychological reasons. Pride is No. 1. You put your trading credentials on the line each time you hit the "buy" button. You may not want to admit you picked wrong. 

 No investor is perfect, though. And perfection isn't needed to make money in stocks. You can buy more losers than winners and still emerge on top. Just dump the losers before they do real damage, and let the winners run. 

 Other investors hang on to falling stocks hoping they'll bounce back. But the stock market doesn't care about your hopes or wishes. Investors lost buckets of money the past few years hoping former highfliers would revisit their heights. Many are hoping still. 

 Other folks fall in love with a stock's story and financial picture and refuse to believe it could tank. The decline is a temporary glitch, their thinking goes. But many stocks break down before their fundamentals cry wolf. Or bad news takes them down. Or a bear market swallows their gains. 

 Don't die the death of a thousand cuts, either. If you're suffering small loss after small loss, it's time to take a break. Maybe the market environment is too shaky. Study your past trades, review your rules and wait for a true bull market and good stocks to emerge.

 Punching In Your Secret Code Can Cost You

 Many debit-card holders may not be aware of new charges for using their personal identification numbers during transactions. 

 The fees, the latest to be levied by a growing number of banks, can be as high as $1.50 every time you punch in your secret code, according to a recent survey of 27 debit-card issuers conducted by ATM&Debit News, an online newsletter. 

 If you have a debit card, "you have to be particularly aware whether your institution charges a fee for PIN or signature" point-of-sale transactions, says Greg McBride, a financial analyst at Bankrate.com, a consumer-finance Web site. 

 While debit cards can be used for ATM withdrawals, their main selling point is they can be substituted for writing checks. Banks have been offering customers dual-purpose ones with the Visa or MasterCard logo that can be used to pay in two ways at point-of-sale terminals. 

 You can swipe the card, press "debit" on a terminal and enter your PIN on a keypad. Or you can swipe the card, press "credit" and sign a sales slip as you would with a credit card. In both cases the money comes out of your bank account. However, you don't pay a fee if you choose the "credit" option. 

 So why are banks charging for using your PIN in what is essentially the same type of transaction? 

 Banks receive fees from merchants, who pay the banks either a flat fee on PIN transactions or a percentage of the transaction amount if a customer signs to pay. The difference between the two fees may be minor on small sums, but can be significant on larger amounts. Banks prefer signature transactions to PIN transactions because it means more money for them, says Jeffrey Greene of ATM&Debit News. 

 In general, bank-card fees are rising. Some issuers have been increasing fees for transactions at other financial institutions. These can be as high as $3, according to the ATM&Debit News survey. 

 Mr. McBride of Bankrate.com says the average fee banks charge their customers for using another bank's ATM is $1.38, up from $1.35 a year ago. The average surcharge banks charge noncustomers at the ATMs also is up, to $1.47 from $1.44. 

 While it's hard to avoid every fee associated with debit cards, there are ways to reduce fees. One way is to try to restrict your ATM transactions to your home bank. Of the banks surveyed, none has increased fees for using proprietary ATMs, and most don't charge anything. 

 Some banks will also waive fees on debit transactions if you keep a certain account balance. Others charge only if you exceed a specific number of transactions in a given period. So find out what your fees are, and don't be afraid to haggle. Some banks would rather reverse a fee than lose a customer.

 MONEY MANAGER 

 Q: I am a 37-year-old single mother of three young children and I earn about $28,000 perannum and receive $9000 perannum in child support. I have a home worth $185,000 and have a mortgage of $93,000. I have been advised to borrow $50,000 as an investment loan, interest only, using the equity in my home as security. This loan will eventually be taken out over a five-year period and at a variable rate. The $50,000 will be invested through my adviser into share trusts. Do you think this sounds extremely risky and could you suggest any alternatives? 

 A: I regard it as a high-risk strategy - not in itself - but because of your circumstances. You are in a low tax bracket, which reduces the tax benefits of gearing, and also means that you have less income available if things go wrong. By increasing your debt to $143,000 against a house property worth $185,000 you have raised your loan to security valuation to nearly 80 percent. As the child support payments appear to come from the government they are secure, but you must consider how you would cope if you lost your job or if interest rates jumped suddenly. My advice is to focus on reducing your debt at this stage, and maybe look at borrowing a little money for investment when the debt is much lower. 

 Q: I am 50 years old and have been in the public service superannuation fund for the last seven years. I recently got $50,000 from a divorce settlement. I have no other savings but owe $5000 in credit card debts to be paid monthly and $500 a month to child support out of a $33,000 salary. As I have to start from scratch I would like to have your advice on how to invest the cash I have at hand. Should I rent a flat at $400 a month out of my wages and use the lump sum to invest: 

 1 - Using $10,000 (stamp duty and legal fees included) to purchase a $60,000 flat; 

 2 - The next $30,000 to invest in a $150,000 property returning seven per cent? 

 3 - The balance of $10,000 be invested directly into growing blue chip shares or via an investment managed fund such as BT funds or Rothschilds. 

 I am looking at a five-year term for all the investments. 

 A: You are not going to have much money (either by way of capital or income) to play with, so I suggest you tread very cautiously. The success of your plan depends entirely on the capital growth in the assets you acquire. With respect to any property you buy, only you can judge that. I feel you are better to take it quietly for a while and stay with good share trusts. They are a simpler investment than property and should show better returns over the long-term. /Te xt.

Weigh up options for selling shares - Money Matters.

FW writes: I have heard about tax changes in the last budget that could benefit employees who own shares in the companies they work for. I have 5,000 unapproved share options that are worth about £35,000. Should I exercise them now and hang on to the shares, or wait to see if the price rises and then exercise and sell straight away?

The budget announcement affected business-asset taper relief for capital gains-tax purposes. Shares in your company qualify as business assets; most other equity investments do not.

Taper relief progressively cuts the amount of capital-gains tax to be paid the longer the share is held. For a higher-rate taxpayer, the effective rate of tax falls from 40% - if the asset is held for less than a year - to 10% after two years. For a basic-rate taxpayer, the rates are 20% and 5% respectively. Previously it was necessary to hold shares for four years to qualify for the lowest rate of tax.

In the case of share options, the "taper clock" does not start ticking until you exercise them and actually own the shares. As your options are unapproved, you will be liable for income tax on the difference between the option price and the prevailing share price when you exercise the options, even if you continue to hold the shares.

Let's assume you have an option to buy a share at £1 and the share price when you exercise is £5. You will have to pay income tax on the £4 profit within 30 days of exercising the option. If you continue to hold the shares, any additional increase in value will be taxed as a capital gain.

If you remain an employee, and qualify for the favourable business-asset taper relief, then after two years only a quarter of the gain will be taxable when you sell. The effective tax rate for a higher-rate taxpayer would therefore be 10%, or 5% if you pay tax at the basic rate.

Exercising your options early and holding the shares can cut your tax bill, but you should consider the risks involved. The biggest risk is that the shares could fall in value. You may also need to borrow to fund the option price and pay the tax - and you could then end up with shares that are worth less than your loan. None of these risks arise if you simply exercise and sell. Also note that the budget proposals will not become law until the Finance Act is passed, probably in July.

 IN July 2000 we booked a Red Sea cruise to coincide with a friend's 65th birthday. Three days before departure he was admitted to hospital as an emergency, suffering from kidney stones. The insurance company has refused to pay out because it claims his previous medical history precluded him from cover. 

 We have had an annual policy in our joint names for years. The earlier medical problems, which were dealt with, did not cause, directly or indirectly, the kidney stones. His doctor was unaware of the underlying problem and did not advise against the cruise, which the doctor knew about. 

 Despite several written and telephoned requests, GE Financial Insurance will not fully explain its reasons for refusal. Could I please ask for your assistance? 

 MF, Brighton, East Sussex 

 The insurer was categoric that it would not pay and that it had said its last word on the matter. I approached it and pointed out that there seemed to be some crossed wires. It was agreed that it would approach your doctor again for further clarification. Then GE Financial Insurance asserted that the doctor was not answering its questions properly and indeed was slow in giving any answers at all. 

 For the record, the doctor had written: "I am quite frankly amazed that you have not settled this chap's claim for the following reasons: 

 "At the time the insurance was purchased he was fit to travel. The sole cause of cancellation of the travel was an emergency admission." 

 The doctor went on to add there had been no prior history of the complaint, which he described in detail. But the insurer says it wanted the doctor to substantiate facts rather than give opinions. 

 Week in and week out for six months, I spoke to my contact at GE Financial Insurance and kept you informed of the little progress that was being made. Now, reams of correspondence after you made your claim, the insurer says it will act. It says it doubts that the doctor will ever answer its questions satisfactorily and agrees with me that you should not suffer because of this. 

 At last, the £3,504 claim is being met. A recurring theme that comes up is that doctors are perceived by insurers investigating claims as not providing all the details required. Understandably enough, more bureaucracy is the last thing a conscientious general practitioner needs when the priority is patients who require urgent attention. 

 Many patients, including yourself, are embarrassed to pester a busy doctor about filling in forms - particularly when paperwork has already been completed, albeit not in the way the insurer would like. 

 Money is usually not the issue for the doctor who has only so many hours in the day and is stretched to the limit by needy patients. I cannot come up with a solution to this dilemma but it is an issue that insurers may need to address.

 MY five-star Supercover policy with Comet was allegedly refundable if unused at its expiry date, the onus being on the policyholder to claim. 

 I duly submitted mine three-and-a-half months ago to be informed I had not registered for the money-back scheme. I am convinced I carried out all the instructions given to me at the time of purchase by the sales assistant. 

 SB, Dorking, Surrey 

 ... A camcorder 

 bought in 1996 ... 

 IN NOVEMBER 1996, I bought a camcorder and was sold a five-year warranty. The only reason I was persuaded to take it out was the promise of the return of the money at the end of the policy. The amount that is owed is #199. The redemption certificate had to be returned to Comet within 30 days of the redemption date, which I did six weeks ago. 

 When I heard nothing, I rang and was told that the policy had been cancelled, which is untrue. I never claimed on the policy or changed it and fulfilled all the necessary requirements to claim the money but Comet is not giving it to me. 

 MB, Exmouth, Devon 

 ... And a fridge 

 for a needy son 

 JUST over five years ago, I bought a refrigerator from Comet to give to my mentally ill son who was being turned out into the community from a mental hospital he had been in for years. Now our lives are very difficult and we are suffering from the revolving-door syndrome of present-day therapy. I remembered the warranty recently and sent off to claim the cash back. The reply to my request for payment is very briefly "No". 

 AC, Grimsby 

 THE five-year no-claims cashback was an additional benefit offered by Comet to customers of extended warranties at no extra cost from October 1996 to March 2001. On purchasing an extended warranty during this period, customers were instructed that, to enjoy the cashback, they would need to register the policy with the insurer by returning a tear-off slip on the insurance policy. On registration, a validated redemption form was sent. After five years, those who have not made a claim can claim back the full price of their warranty by sending the certificate of insurance and validated redemption form to the insurers within 30 days of the policy's expiry. 

 Comet says there is no record of receiving SB's cashback registration. However, it is now paying the #399.99. It is also refunding #199 for MB, although MB found it slightly galling to be told this was being done as a goodwill gesture when the money was only his due. 

 AC returned his policy documents outside the 30 days of the expiry of the policy. In view of the mitigating circumstances, however, his #207 is being refunded. Comet says that the first it knew of his difficulties was via this column.

 Economists At IADB Criticizes Bush's New Steel Import Rule

 FORTALEZA, Brazil (AP)--The U.S. decision to protect its    steel industry by barring imports could encourage Latin American nations to turn their back on free trade and spark a new wave of protectionism across the region, economists said Saturday at a regional bank meeting here. 

 Economists addressing the 43rd annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank roundly criticized U.S. President George W. Bush's decision to impose punitive tariffs on steel imports. 

 They said it played into the hands of populist politicians who oppose free trade and can capitalize on Latin Americans' weariness with free-market reforms that have largely failed to spread prosperity over the past decade. 

 "It's a phenomenal step backwards of extreme importance    that should worry us greatly," said Sebastian Edwards, professor of economics at UCLA. "I only hope it is an isolated case." 

 He said a broader turn toward protectionism in the rich Northern Hemisphere could have disastrous effects on Latin American economies at a time when some already look back with nostalgia to the years when Latin America's economies were largely closed to imports. 

 That kept people in jobs, but it also meant inferior quality products and services and in many cases spiraling inflation fueled by profligate public spending and the printing of bank notes. 

 A study by the banks' economists showed that Latin Americans -and especially the middle classes -are disillusioned with reforms, associating them with corruption    that has tainted the sell-off of state sector companies in some countries. 

 The recent collapse of Argentina, once a poster-child for free-market reforms, has further added to Latin Americans' doubts. Many say free-market policies are really policies designed to guarantee domination by U.S. companies and their products. 

 Goods produced in the region -raw materials and farming goods -bring meager prices or are kept out of rich markets altogether, they complain. 

 There is growing skepticism of a Bush-backed project to build a Free Trade Area of the Americas -a single market stretching from Alaska to Argentina -by 2005. 

 Edwards and others said they did not believe the region's populists -Argentina's President Eduardo Duhalde and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez -would resort to all-out economic populism. 

 But they said several other countries could succumb to anti-free-trade rhetoric, especially now that Bush has been seen to abandon his overtly free-trade stance. 

 "I believe that macroeconomic populism, even in countries like Venezuela, is dead," said Edwards. But he said it was vital for emerging economies to have access to rich, industrialized markets as a logical reward for implementing market-friendly economics at home. 

 "The danger is that a more insidious form of populism is making a comeback," said Eliana Cardoso, visiting economics professor at Georgetown University in Washington D.C.. "This form of populism is industrial protectionism and it comes at a moment when the United States is setting us the worst possible example." 09/03/02 19-18G

 Cost And Capacity Cuts, Not Tariffs, Seen Key To Steel

 Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Proposed tariffs of 20% to 40%, which could be imposed by President Bush s early as Wednesday, won't be enough by themselves to turn around the fortunes of the U.S. domestic steel industry. 

 That's the opinion of credit analysts say credit analysts. 

 Controlling "costs and capacity" will be much more important in the near term for the steel industry than imposing tariffs on imports, says Domenick Fumai, vice president fixed income research, BNP Paribas. 

 Tariffs won't eliminate the "real cost disadvantages," of the domestic steel industry, added Leo Larkin, equity metals analyst, Standard & Poor's Corp. 

 The Bush administration launched a review of steel imports last year, pursuant to Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974, as part of an effort to rescue the ailing industry. Late in the year, the International Trade Commission concluded that imports had damaged the steel industry and recommended trade restrictions that could include tariffs of between 20% and 40% on imported steel. 

 The steel companies and steel workers have been talking about 40% tariff levels, said Larkin. But, while no one expects tariffs that high to be imposed, it can be "assumed    that some tariff relief will be granted," Larkin said. 

 Even tariffs at 40% won't cure the industry's ills, says Larkin and other analysts. 

 It is a "troubled sector and will remain so for some time," says Nate Hudson, principal and bond analyst, Banc of America Securities. 

 The industry suffers from excessive production capacity, analysts say. And, when steel companies file for bankruptcy, which nearly 30 have done since 1998, they don't liquidate. Instead, they reorganize and continue to produce steel that isn't needed. 

 It would be better for the industry if these companies "sold their facilities for scrap," said one analyst. 


   `Legacy Costs'



In addition to excess capacity, the industry is plagued by excessive
costs. Many of the companies, if not bankrupt, are near bankruptcy, said
BofA's Hudson.



For high cost producers, tariff relief won't be enough, Hudson said.
Instead, steel prices would have to be much higher, but it isn't
realistic to expect that to occur in the present economic environment,
he added



Many of the costs relate to what are termed "legacy costs." This
refers to pension costs and medical payments for retirees, said Larkin.



It's estimated that these costs range anywhere from about $12 billion
to $14 billion in total for domestic steel producers.



U.S Steel Group (X) has proposed that a "government-sponsored program"
relieve the industry of these costs. But, this is unlikely to occur
because of the precedent it might set for other ailing industries, said
S&P's Larkin.



In socialized systems, such as in Europe, these costs are paid for by
the government, he added.

 Q & A - Build on other investments before super.

 Ross Rickard, an executive director and senior financial planning consultant at PKF Planning with more than 20 years' business and management experience, answers your questions on personal finance. 

 Q THERE has been a lot of information put out about the long-term benefits of superannuation and I do have overall agreement with these. However, I am a long way off retirement (30 years or so) and do not understand why I should contribute to something that I cannot touch for that amount of time. Would it not make more sense for me to in invest in shares or managed funds so that I can access them if I need them, but use this as a base for my retirement and place more money into superannuation later in life? E.M., Hollywell 

 A WHILE superannuation has the benefit of a low tax environment, contributions made remain preserved until you reach preservation age, which in your case would be at 60. Therefore, I agree it would be better for you to concentrate on building your investments outside the super environment and let your compulsory employer contributions add to your super at this stage. 

 Build up an investment portfolio that addresses your short and medium-term needs before you concentrate on your longer-term needs. 

 This also provides flexibility and liquidity for any unforeseen circumstances that may occur. 

 Q I AM currently looking at changing my mortgage lender for no other reason than to look at the alternatives and to ensure that I have secured a good deal. I was surprised that the lenders that I looked at were very flexible and willing 'to do a deal'. As I am a salary earner and wanting to pay off my mortgage as fast as possible, what are the aspects that I should be looking for? K.W., Ashmore 

 A PICK the option that best suits your needs and savings patterns. You could consider a 'revolving line of credit' or similar facility. This allows your salary to be paid directly into your loan and you use a credit card for all monthly expenses. At the end of the month, you draw off your loan to repay your credit card. This can reduce the term on your loan by quite a few years. 

 Also, consider the merits of a fixed-term loan, as interest rates have pretty much bottomed out. 

 By fixing for a term of three years, for example, you may be protecting yourself against interest rate increases, which could occur at any time in this time frame. 

 Be aware though that fixed-term interest rates are usually higher than standard variable rates.

 National Savings throws off its dowdy look.

 30 million customers can't all be wrong, writes Tony Lyons 

 The retail savings arm of the Treasury will be transforming itself within months. Try any post office next week, and the racks will be bulging with brochures extolling the virtues of putting your cash with National Savings. 

 A free tracing service will help customers find forgotten accounts, and customers will be able to deal with all products 24 hours a day, seven days a week by calling just one phone number (0845 964 5000, on national rates). The phone should be answered within 10 seconds by a human. 

 Next month, National Savings hopes its internet site (www.nsandi.co.uk) will be up and running. This will allow all its savings and investments now available by phone to be bought over the internet. "We will also gradually extend the product range," the chief executive, Peter Bareau, says, "including upgrading those such as the ordinary and investment accounts which still use a pass-book that needs to be sent in." 

 National Savings are not popular with many financial advisers. Donna Bradshaw, of Fiona Price & Partners IFA, says: "Apart from premium bonds, the other National Savings bonds, savings certificates and deposit accounts are not very attractive. But now that interest rates have fallen, they have become more competitive." Some of the criticism is unfair. With 17,000-plus post office outlets, as well as postal, telephone and internet access, National Savings is a huge mainstream savings institution. It has 30 million customers, far more than anyone else, and with #62bn invested only Halifax is bigger. 

 Cash Isas up to #3,000 can be invested tax-free in the financial year and they are popular. For any amount over #10, National Savings is paying a middle-of-the-road 4.15 per cent. But while there are better offers, it is pretty good among those few that are CAT-marked - no one-off or regular charges, a minimum transaction size of no more than #10, and ease of access so withdrawals can be made in one week or less. 

 With fixed-interest savings, only the likes of Pensioners Bonds and Capital Bonds pay interest gross. There is still a tax liability, but this can play an important role in tax planning, especially for the retired or those with low incomes. Premium bonds are the most well-known National Savings product. "Sales have been going like a train,"Mr Bareau says. Next month, the rate of interest for bond prizes drops from 2.9 to 2.4 per cent, to reflect the last fall in the minimum lending rate. Since the onset of the bear market in equities two years ago, fixed interest has become a more popular home for savings. Last year National Savings attracted #11.5bn of our money. This goes to the Treasury, to finance 20 per cent of our national debt. And National Savings & Investments offer total security and no risk.

Anyone bold enough to buy an apartment in Knightsbridge in 1991, back when negative equity was stalking the UK housing market, has made a killing.

On the latest Knight Frank figures, the value of a prime two-bedroom apartment in London has increased by 193 per cent over the decade compared with 49 per cent for a similar apartment in Sydney and the Thames-side gain has been magnified by the shift in exchange rates.

The other top performers are Milan and Madrid, where prices have risen 150 per cent. But New York, at 50 per cent, looks no better than Sydney except for the exchange rate effect and Hong Kong prices rose only 30 per cent.

Anyone who fell for the romance of the Left Bank made a disastrous real estate decision. According to Knight Frank, apartment prices in Paris fell 10 per cent between 1991 and 2001.

Perhaps the Paris experience is why Australians have been so slow to invest in the global housing market. For most, the attractions of the domestic market more than outweigh the benefits of a villa in the Dordogne or a lodge in Aspen. Not only must international investors master the complexities of property cycles, repricing between neighbourhoods, financing and management, but they have to understand the changing culture of cities and the power of exchange rates.

In the Corcoran global real estate survey of March 2000, Tokyo's Motoazabu had the most expensive two-bedroom apartments in the world at an average of $US1.8 million. A year later, they had dropped to $US720,000 out of the top 10, and well below Sydney's East Circular Quay and London's Eaton Square had moved into top spot, followed by units in San Francisco's Pacific Heights.

Similarly, on the Jones Lang LaSalle numbers, anyone who invested US dollars in Jakarta executive apartments in the September quarter of 2001 saw a 20 per cent jump in value. But that is all to do with the appreciation of the rupiah, not the fundamentals of a market where vacancy rates still top 40 per cent.

Of course, Australia's housing market is one of the few yet to show the wobbles. Central London apartment prices dipped 2 per cent in the September quarter, according to Chesterton Residential, and New York prices have dropped 15 per cent since September, Corcoran says though in both cities the Christmas activity has been stronger than expected.

Even in Aspen, activity has slowed. In the third quarter of 2000, 49 houses changed hands in Snowmass at an average of $US3.07 million, but in 2001 only 29 changed hands and the average slid to $US2.282 million.

Closer to home, the once impregnable Singapore real estate market has been scuttled. On the Colliers International numbers, condominium and apartment rents have fallen more than 20 per cent in the past two years, and further falls are expected as stock levels grow and the economy sinks further into recession.

 The hidden cost of interest-free.

 BEHIND the slick advertising of interest-free deals are traps for the unwary that could make that new lounge you bought at the January sales much more expensive if you get caught by the fine print. 

 All major retailers offer interest-free deals and, all too often, they attract people who are already over-committed or who buy on impulse without thinking through how much they can afford to repay. 

 There are two types of interest-free loans. The first is interest-free with instalments where you pay a deposit and have a set period to pay off the loan before the interest kicks in. The other option is to buy now pay later. With this breed of loan you pay as much as you want at the start with the rest paid at the end of a set period, say six months. 

 Interest-free loans are generally provided by the more aggressive personal finance companies and when it comes to the contracts there is no standard approach. 

 The result is many interesting terms and conditions of which borrowers should be aware. One of the most painful is the cost of not repaying the loan in time. Miss the interest-free cut off by one day and the interest will be backdated to the date of purchase. In some cases, the interest rate is 26 per cent or more, making a pretty hefty bill. 

 Interest-free loans have a minimum amount that needs to be repaid each month and many people assume this is the amount required to pay off the loan in the interest-free period. In fact, people who only repay the minimum end up well short, making it important to do the numbers yourself. It is also a good idea to take the documents away before you sign so you can make an assessment in a less-pressured environment. 

 Financial counsellors tell me that in some cases the credit provider will issue the borrower with a credit card during the interest-free period. The game plan here is to tempt the borrower to pay off all or part of the loan with credit instantly turning the interest-free loan into one that is accruing interest. 

 The bottom line is to think carefully before you take on an interest-free loan. The first step is to do a realistic budget to determine your capacity to repay the loan in the interest-free period. 

 Your calculation must be comprehensive and have some leeway in case things go wrong. If you take on the loan, have a regular method of repayment to make sure the repayments are made. Personally, I believe these interest-free loans are a disaster waiting to happen. If you can afford the item you want to purchase, you will do a much better deal with cash.

 Allianz Consortium Leader For Metals Indus Pension Fund

 BERLIN -(Dow Jones)- German insurer Allianz AG (AZ) is the consortium leader for a new pension fund for the German metals industry's 3.6 million workers, the IG Metall union and Gesamtmetall employers association said Tuesday. 

 In addition, the insurance company Victoria Versicherung AG (G.VIV) and financial services companies BHW AG (G.BHW) and Westdeutsche Landesbank AG (G.WLG) will be part of the consortium. 

 The new pension fund comes in response to occupational pension reform in Germany that will allow tax incentives for pension funds for the first time in 2002. 

 As of next year, Germans will be allowed to put away 4% of their salaries annually in the new form of savings funds, which will be taxed at retirement. Companies are required to offer their workers access to such a plan, which is the reason why IG Metall and Gesamtmetall decided to form the new plan, called MetallRente. 

 Germany's occupational pension reform shouldn't be confused with the widely publicized private pension reform, also taking effect next year. Under that reform, individuals can put away up to 1% of their income next year in a private pension product, rising to 4% by 2008. 

 (Corrected 1037GMT) 

 In addition, the insurance company Victoria Versicherung AG (G.VIV) and financial services companies BHW AG (G.BHW) and Westdeutsche Landesbank AG (G.WLG) will be part of the consortium. 

 (In an item that ran at around 0925 GMT, the financial services company BHW AG was incorrectly identified as the bank Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank AG, which is commonly referred to as BHV.) 

 IG Metall said it expects about 400,000 contracts from its workers next year for the MetallRente, which would add up to a pension fund worth around DEM10 billion after 10 years. 

 But the union stressed that this is based on assumptions that could be radically different depending on how the market develops. Those variables include the number of companies that actually participate in the pension plan, and the number of workers that decide to put money away, for example. 

 MetallRente is expected to be a much cheaper alternative for workers than an individual retirement savings contract with a private company, the union said. Administrative costs for the MetallRente will be considerably lower than those charged by insurance companies for similar annuity-type products, and will make a significant difference in the final payout at retirement. 

 Occupational pension reform is expected to be big business for insurance companies and banks in the coming years. The new asset management market in Germany could be as big as EUR250 billion by 2010, Goldman Sachs estimates. 

 Earlier this autumn, the chemicals industry announced a similar plan. 

 The metals industry pension plan will cover all three of the various methods of retirement funding supported by the new pension reform. These include a direct insurance plan from an insurance company, a pension fund, and a pension pool, or "pensionskasse."

 Finance - Grab that cash, girls.

 WOMEN GET MONEY-WISE 

 NEW research shows that women are more money-wise than men and are taking over the management of the family finances. 

 An Abbey National survey reveals that 32 per cent of women aged 18-35 - an eight per cent rise on last year - are now in charge of the money side of life compared with just 19 per cent of men. Forty-nine per cent say they share the burden. 

 Women in that age group are also more likely to check out the web for the best deals on ISAs, mortgages and pensions. 

 Joint accounts are becoming less popular as couples keep control of their own cash. 

 Kelly Sommerton is a good example. She has lived with Matt Brito for three years and they bought a North London flat in April. Matt, 25, is a advertising copywriter and Kelly, 21, works in marketing. 

 She has always been in charge of their finances. "Matt loves the fact I have taken control - he is useless with money," says Kelly. "Our one-bedroom flat cost #84,000 and we pay #607 per month in mortgage. Apart from that, all the bills come to about #200 a month. 

 "Matt has a standing order of cash that goes into one of my accounts and that is what we pay all the bills with. 

 "I'm very organised. I have six different accounts - for bills, holidays, the car, essentials, everyday use and for saving. 

 "I also have a little book I carry with me to write down incomings and outgoings." 

 One current tip for wised-up women is that Abbey National's current account now offers an interest-free overdraft for one year and a low rate of 9.9 per cent, making this a good deal to switch to. 

 One area where women are not so clued-up is store cards - one in five women have one or more compared to one in 10 men who use store cards. 

 Interest rates can be as high as 25.3 per cent, and it's much cheaper to use a credit card. One of the best is from Egg, which is interest-free for six months, then 11.9 per cent. 

 Good financial advice can pay dividends. The Bank of Scotland has a free "woman to woman" service with meetings at a branch, at home or at work - a similar service from an independent financial adviser could cost you about #150. 

 The bank set up the service after women customers said they found female staff "less intimidating". 

 Women get better car insurance deals too - because they make fewer claims. Diamond, who offer policies only to women, would ask for an annual premium of #486 for a 25-year-old woman living outside London who runs a Renault Clio. The average high street cost would be #650. 

 And travel insurers Primary Direct have a policy for a single parent and two children which is half the price of family insurance.

 USX-U.S. Steel's Results Swing to Loss; Company Foresees Tough Fourth Period

 USX-U.S. Steel Group posted dismal third-quarter results as steel prices continued to fall amid one of the worst and prolonged economic downturns for the domestic steel industry. The company said the fourth quarter will be just as tough because of an anticipated 10% dropoff in shipments. 

 Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, the largest steelmaker in the country, reported a loss of $23 million, or 28 cents a share, for the third quarter of 2001, compared with net income of $19 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. Nine analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call had estimated the steelmaker would post a loss of between 20 cents and 64 cents a share, with a mean predicted loss of 42 cents. 

 Though the third quarter saw revenue rise 13% to $1.65 billion from $1.46 billion the year before, the company saw little benefit because of a steep drop in average steel prices. U.S. Steel's product prices fell 7.5% to $420 a ton from $454 a ton a year ago. "Domestic steel's commercial environment remains extremely difficult due to the weakening economy and the devastating impact that global oversupply continues to have on the U.S. steel industry," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Thomas J. Usher. 

 There was some good news at the company's new steelmaking facilities in Kosice, Slovakia, which sells steel only in Europe. Average steel prices at the facility rose 2.8% to $256 a ton from $249 a ton a year earlier. U.S. Steel is the only domestic steelmaker to have significant operations overseas. Likewise, the company was buoyed by a government panel finding yesterday that U.S. Steel and other domestic steelmakers were "seriously injured" when foreign steelmakers glutted the market with cheap imports. The ruling could mean that trade curbs could be implemented in the U.S., severely limiting competition. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, shares of U.S. Steel rose $1.31, or 9.8%, to $14.74. 

 Looking to the fourth quarter, Mr. Usher said that advanced steel orders, a key indicator of demand for the next few months, are currently running lower than the third-quarter rate. The third quarter is traditionally the weakest quarter of the year as slower automotive steel orders reflect new model car changeovers. Mr. Usher said that he expects prices to remain relatively the same in the fourth quarter as they were in the third quarter. Usually, prices rise in the fourth quarter as demand picks up. He also said that he expects lower maintenance costs for the fourth quarter, but that would be offset by rising natural-gas costs. 

 Mr. Usher said U.S. Steel would consider separating its profitable tubular-goods operation sometime next year. Tubular goods are used in drilling and transporting oil.

 Q Are women with large amounts to invest generally more cautious than men? Should they be? A While there is no reason for them to be, women are often more cautious with investments - often to their detriment. To make your money work for you, you need the right time frame and appropriate asset mix to achieve your goals. This often involves short term volatility of capital and return which women often find harder to come to terms with. 

 You work with people who have lots of cash. What would you suggest a 40-year-old do with a spare $200,000? Ensure that they have an adequate cash reserve and then invest the balance in a diversified tax effective growth portfolio. 

 How much did you earn in your first job? I worked in a nightclub in Queensland while on a six month holiday straight after school and they gave me a uniform that shrunk every time I washed it. It was known as the incredible shrinking uniform. Needless to say, after a couple of months, my tip jar was healthy. 

 Are you happy with your financial situation now or would more money make you happier? Balance is important. I am very happy with my lifebut like everybody else, I need to keep working on my financial plan to achieve my goals. 

 Have you ever had the opportunity to make lots of money but passed it up? It's hard to say, because who knows the results of taking a different life path. I try not to waste too much time on regrets. Life's short, and you're a long time dead. 

 Do you believe it really is the thought that counts or should people spend a certain amount on presents? Time, especially with the busy life we all lead today, is the most precious commodity. Presents are always fun. They're all special and cost is irrelevant. 

 Should a man spend a month's wages on an engagement ring? It's a personal issue. For me, I would honestly want my man to spend more than a month's wages. Think about it, it's a pretty special thing. Still, I'm happy to buy my own jewellery too. 

 What is the cheapest present you have given someone? Who got it? A very cheeky Kris Kringle gift for Christmas. Cost: $2. 

 What was the most expensive present you have given someone? Who got it?? We bought my mother a trip to Europe for her 60th. 

 Did you get pocketmoney as a child? How much? What did you do with it? $5 per week which went towards icypoles, Choo choo bars and boyfriends. 

 What would you buy first if you won Tattslotto? A trip around the world with my partner travelling in the pointy end of the plane. And, a nice dog sitter for Idgie my dog. 

 FROM this week Louise Keating will answer readers questions in a new Saturday Your Money section.

 Strategy for retiring at age 55.

 Q I owe $7200 on my own home valued at $270,000 and repay it at $100 per fortnight. I negatively gear my 10-month-old investment property valued at $230,000 on which I owe $150,000 at 6.8 per cent with rent of $235 per week. I repay this at $600 per fortnight. 

 My income is $51,000 pa and I currently salary sacrifice $10,800 pa into my superannuation fund which is currently worth $70,000. I have $3000 in a low interest bank account. I own 600 Telstra shares. My son begins university next year and I would like to pay his HECS. 

 What strategies could I put in place to give me the best options to retire at 55? A You have not given your age so my comments must be fairly general. However, I suggest you talk to your adviser about reducing your home loan payments to $80 per fortnight which will have the loan paid off in less than five years with minimal interest. 

 Also talk to your bank about moving your investment loan to interest only which will reduce the payments to $392 per fortnight. This will free up extra money for salary sacrifice into superannuation and for paying the HECS fees. 

 You should also consider investing any spare money into a share-based unit trust with the aim of creating a fund worth at least $150,000 to pay off the investment loan in due course. 

 Q I am 60 years of age and semi retired. Assets are $460,000 in superannuation and $180,000 in a self-managed portfolio of shares, bonds and cash management trusts. 

 A small consultancy covers expenses, with all surplus directed to superannuation as salary sacrifice, but this income is variable and could end soon. 

 Assuming full retirement at age 65, what is the best strategy and timing in funds reallocation to end up with a unit of about $250,000, personal portfolio of at least $100,000 and the balance of the super rolled over to allocated pension or annuity to provide about $20,000 annual income? A If property prices are increasing in the area that you wish to locate to, it may make sense to try to buy as soon as possible. 

 You could put down a substantial deposit from your non-superannuation portfolio and the rents would probably pay the interest until you retire. You could fund this with an interest only loan and pay it out from your superannuation after retirement. 

 For tax purposes you should try to maximise the amount you have in superannuation. You should contemplate putting part of your assets into an annuity. This would give you a guaranteed income for life and may enable you to claim some age pension and a health card.

 City - Your Money - Remortgaging - Ombudsman steps in over rate complaints Borrowers were locked into old deals. Melanie Wright reports. 

 BORROWERS with lenders that offer two different variable rates could be in line for compensation if the Financial Ombudsman supports a recommendation by its adjudicator. 

 Halifax, Nationwide and HSBC have all been reported to the Ombudsman by borrowers protesting that they are locked into higher variable rates than the banks' new customers. 

 All three lenders introduced new lower variable rates earlier this year, while retaining their old variable rates for many of their existing borrowers. Customers are usually locked into the old rates because they originally signed up to discounted or capped-rate deals. 

 There are often penalties for switching out of this rate before the discounted or capped period ends. However, borrowers are free to switch, or in many cases are automatically moved to the new variable rate, once the penalty period is up. Abbey National, Cheltenham & Gloucester and Woolwich also have at least two different variable rates. 

 The Financial Ombudsman adjudicator has ruled in favour of a Halifax customer with a capped-rate mortgage, who complained to the Ombudsman after the bank introduced its new variable rate, 0.75pc lower than Halifax's old rate, in March. The adjudicator said that a reference to the bank's base rate in the customer's mortgage documents was not defined in the terms and conditions of the mortgage and therefore should be taken to mean the new variable rate. 

 A spokesman for Halifax said: "The reason we introduced the new variable rate was to narrow the gap between new customers and existing borrowers. The idea is that we will eventually phase out the old rate altogether. We believe what we have done is right and is in the best interests of our customers. 

 "These customers were happy with the terms and conditions at the time they took out their mortgages and we made it crystal clear that these deals were linked to the standard variable rate." 

 A spokesman for the Financial Ombudsman said that it was unlikely to change the ruling by the adjudicator unless significant new information emerges. 

 HSBC has also been taken to the Ombudsman by one of its borrowers and an adjudicator found in favour of the customer. The case is currently under review. Adjudication on a Nationwide case is expected in a few weeks. 

 Borrowers who are unhappy with their bank or building society must first follow the internal complaints procedure. If the problem is still not resolved, they can then complain to the Financial Ombudsman. You will need to complete a complaint form for the ombudsman's office to look at your case. The form can be downloaded from the ombudsman's website at www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk. Complaint forms should be sent to The Financial Ombudsman Service, South Quay Plaza, 183 Marsh Wall, London E14 9SR. Tel: 0845 080 1800.

 Women, Children Enter Ruddock's Home Detention

 Five women and five children will be released from the Woomera detention centre into houses in the outback South Australian town today in what will amount to detention outside a detention centre. 

 The Immigration Department has assessed the claims of 27 volunteers from the Woomera detention centre to be released into the community and found 10 worthy of release into the ``women and children's trial'' promised by the Immigration Minister, Mr Ruddock. 

 But the group of asylum seekers, made up of three families, will be under 24-hour-a-day guard and unable to leave the houses by themselves. 

 Mr Ruddock said 17 people were refused entry into the trial program. 

 Some boys in applicant families were over the age of 12, which he said was close to manhood in Middle Eastern terms, and others were soon to have a determination on their asylum claims, so there was little point. 

 Mr Ruddock stuck to his promise that women and children would only be released for the trial if a male in the family was kept back at the detention centre. 

 ``It was interesting Woomera has around about 700 or 800 people in detention at the moment of which over 200 are children ... 27 were the number [of volunteers] to be received,'' Mr Ruddock said. 

 He said ``families didn't want to be separated even in the way we're proposing''. 

 Mr Ruddock said he expected more interest once families heard about the state    of the houses, which had been renovated. 

 The trial was due to last six months and would cost $1.5 million, which would    be subsumed into the department's budget, Mr Ruddock said. 

 The Opposition's immigration spokesman, Mr Con Sciacca, said yesterday the Government could have bought home units in Sydney for the money and it was a ridiculous waste for 10 people. 

 ``We're talking $150,000 per person,'' Mr Sciacca said. 

 ``Woomera ... is not the appropriate place to trial this.'' 

 Mr Sciacca said if Labor won office, it would have a trial that was set up to    succeed, rather than Mr Ruddock's program, which he said was designed to fail. 

 ``Where I would conduct such a trial is near a detention centre in a city or a large town,'' he said. 

 ``That sort of trial would be better [situated] somewhere like Port Hedland or Villawood with proper support groups around the place.'' 

 Mr Ruddock's press release announcing the program yesterday did refer to a women and children's trial, instead calling it an ``alternative detention project''. 

 ``Participants will still formally be in detention with most of their day-to-day needs provided for, as they would be in the detention centre,'' Mr Ruddock said. 

 If a participant's asylum claim was rejected, they would be taken back into detention, he said. 

 Five women and five children aged from two to 10 are taking part in the trial.

 Welfare The Growth Area For Women's Incomes

 Despite the massive changes in girls' education, independence and aspirations, the proportion of women in full-time work is about the same as 30 years ago, a conference was told yesterday. 

 Professor Bob Gregory, professor of economics at the Australian National University, said: ``If full-time work was the desired goal, it hasn't been achieved.'' 

 He said the ``spectacular'' growth area for women who needed a ``full-time'' income was the welfare system, not full-time work. Women dependent on social security had increased from 5 per cent to 20 per cent in the past 30 years, though some also earned a small income. 

 Part-time work was the other big growth area. He told the Future of Work conference run by the NSW Department of Education and TAFE that this was an unexpected outcome considering women now made up half of all university graduates. About 32 per cent of women aged 15-64 worked full-time in 1966 compared with 34 per cent in 1999. 

 He said full-time jobs had become ``increasingly rare'' in Australia. And most of those created required both sexes to work more than 45 hours a week. 

 ``More people want full-time jobs,'' he said, ``but the number of full-time jobs has shrunk.'' 

 He said if the Government wanted to put half the women dependent on welfare into full-time positions it would require a 30 per cent increase in those jobs. 

 ``And we've had virtually no increase in 30 years,'' he said. ``You're asking for a miracle.'' 

 In the 1970s, 80 per cent of the new jobs for women were part-time, in the 1980s, 75 per cent and in the 1990s, 60 per cent. In addition, 60 per cent of the extra jobs created for men in the 1990s were part-time. 

 ``Whether it's a shortage of full-time jobs or an increasing demand for part-time jobs, it's a changed world,'' he said. ``Whether it's a trend or accident, full-time jobs have never been clawed back after the last two recessions.'' 

 Unemployment rates had fallen in recent times    not because of a revival in full-time positions but because people had stopped looking for full-time work, he said. 

 However if a man or woman wanted a 35-hour week they were in a shrinking market. ``If you want a full-time job, it means lots and lots of hours,'' he said. ``You can be a 49-hour person or a part-time person. The middle road is disappearing.'' 

 The main reason is that premium companies put on skilled workers. Employers would rather make a skilled and experienced employee work longer hours than go into the pool of social security recipients and ``drag a worker out''. 

 As a result young workers, aged 15-24, even with education, were having a harder time and their real wages were marginally lower than 30 years ago. </Text >

Fund Track
 Encouraging Growth Investing for Retirees

 Though common wisdom dictates that retirees shun growth-stock mutual funds in favor of more conservative investments, Jim Thompson and William Gadsden of Zurich Scudder Investments beg to differ. 

 "It's somewhat of a myth that when people retire, they should downshift to cash or bonds," Mr. Thompson, Scudder's director of shareholder education, said at a briefing last week. "We think there's room for growth investing for retirees, especially if they want to leave a legacy." 

 Retirees are the most overlooked area of the investor universe, but this will change as the baby-boomer generation reaches retirement age, Mr. Thompson predicted. He pointed out that older investors face not only the often-noted risks of inflation and loss of principal that cannot be regained, but also the risk of "outliving one's money." 

 This risk isn't well understood, Mr. Thompson said. He cited a recent Scudder survey that found that 40% of people in their 70s hadn't factored life expectancy into their financial planning. He also cited an Employee Benefit Research Institute study that found that 20% of workers believe they will live less than 10 years after retiring. 

 "Maybe they know something I don't, but I'd say that's an unrealistic figure," he said. 

 Formerly employed for 17 years by the American Association of Retired Persons, Mr. Thompson now works for the AARP Investment Program from Scudder, a unit of Switzerland's Zurich Insurance. The program, which has a total of $14 billion in assets under management, offers AARP members a family of 40 no-load mutual funds in which to invest. 

 Among them is the $2 billion Scudder Capital Growth Fund, managed by Mr. Gadsden. About 30% of the 100,000 or so investors in the fund are over age 70, he said. "Longer life spans increase the need to invest in more aggressive funds," he said. 

 The Scudder Capital Growth Fund is down 15.9% year to date, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, which has lost 9% so far this year. But the portfolio has a 10-year annualized return of 14.18%, according to fund-tracking firm Morningstar Inc., whose Web site describes the fund as "not flashy, but it gets the job done." 

 "We don't believe in taking outsized risks for outsized returns," said Mr. Gadsden. "We invest in large-cap stocks with moderate, sustainable growth rates." 

 The fund is about 26.6% invested in technology, 17% in health care, 11% in financials, 10.3% in media, 6.7% in manufacturing and 6.6% in consumer discretionary, with smaller amounts invested in energy, consumer staples, service industries, communications and durables. Top holdings include Microsoft Corp. at 5.2%, General Electric Co. at 4.6%, Pfizer Inc. at 3.8% and Citigroup at 3.5%. 

 Mr. Gadsden is especially partial to the financial industry. "There are lots of overlooked, moderate-growth stocks in financials," he said.

 Providing medical testing to help children read better

 The rain last Wednesday pushed the humidity to the level of drench at the Holy Temple of The Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, a storefront worship space in West Philadelphia. But the 20 children didn't seem to mind much. They dutifully worked on journal writing until each was called to stand against the wall and cover one eye. 

 "T-E-V," said 6-year-old Juwan, his head thrust forward in an effort to read the eye chart 20 feet away. 

 Juwan participates in Youth Education for Tomorrow, a program that provides daily literacy education for school-age children. Seven churches in West Philadelphia have been selected to participate in the program. The children were identified during the school year as struggling readers. For 90 minutes every weekday, they work on writing in journals and improving their reading skills with the 100 Book Challenge reading program. 

 But the Haddington Community Health Project Collaborative is taking the program a step further. This summer, visiting nurses are conducting vision and hearing screenings. 

 "We want to make sure that children's reading problems aren't caused by hearing or sight problems," said Dr. Robin Foster-Drain, director of To Our Children's Future with Health, a member agency of the collaborative. 

 Holy Temple is small, and during the week, it is crowded with tables, chairs and colorful plastic baskets full of books. The nurse conducting the hearing tests had to make do with a small space to set up her equipment. The tests were halted from time to time when the Market Frankford El trains rumbled overhead. 

 Notations were made on the worksheets of those who had difficulty making out the letters or hearing the tones. Foster-Drain will make sure that parents are contacted and that follow-up care is scheduled. 

 For most of the children, being outfitted with the heavy headphones was a first. Such hearing tests aren't necessarily a part of a regular well-child physical exam. But a surprising number of children indicated they had never taken the vision test either. 

 "Which means they probably haven't had annual physicals," said Foster-Drain. "A lot of our children only see a doctor when they're sick, and that's usually through an emergency room visit." 

 In addition to making sure the children get the medical attention they need, Foster-Drain said the collaborative will work to reinforce at home the literacy lessons the children are acquiring this summer. 

 "We want families to know that reading to children and having books available to them is as important as health care," she said. "It's vital." 

 Over the summer, the screenings will continue at the other six churches. Members of the collaborative are determined to give the children they find a chance to make successful school careers. 

 It is faith-based initiative at its best.

 Mediterranean specialties dominate menu at Cafe International

 Creating good, authentic Mediterranean food is no easy task, says Cafe International co-owner Sam Osman. 

 "What sets us apart from other restaurants serving Mediterranean food in Las Vegas is the authenticity of the food, that special something that we put into the food," Osman says. "It's not just following a recipe." 

 Osman, the son of a Lebanese father and German mother, moved to Las Vegas from Southern California a year ago thinking there were greater opportunities here to pursue a film and television acting career. But he also saw a niche to fill in the Mediterranean dining category. 

 "We pride ourselves on the fact that almost everything is made from scratch, including stuffed grape leaves," Osman says. 

 Cafe International, 6346 S. Pecos Road, opened Feb. 16. 

 Mediterranean sandwich items include falafel, a combination of chickpeas, fava beans and other vegetables, along with sesame sauce, tomatoes and pickled vegetables ($3.95); shawarma, similar to a gyro, in beef or chicken ($5.95); and chicken, beef or lamb and ground beef kebab sandwiches ($5.95 each). 

 One salad choice with a Mediterranean touch is fattoush, with lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, radish, green bell peppers, parsley, mint and toasted pita bread strips ($4.95). Another is tabbouleh, with finely chopped parsley, finely milled wheat, diced tomatoes, yellow and green onions, and mint ($4.95). 

 For appetizers, there's the popular hummus, a puree of chickpeas and tahini (sesame sauce), with garlic, lemon juice and olive oil and served with pita bread ($3.95); baba ghanouj, cooked eggplants and tahini with garlic, lemon juice and olive oil ($4.95); labneh, sour cream with dry mint and olive oil and served with green olives and pita bread ($3.95); shangleesh, dairy-product balls made with milk, spices and olive oil, served with pita bread ($4.95); and zahtar pizza, pizza dough topped with a spread of thyme, sesame seeds and olive oil ($2.95). 

 Entrees include chicken, beef or lamb and ground beef kebab plates ($9.95 each); beef or chicken shawarma plate ($9.95); ground beef meat pie pizza ($7.95); stuffed grape leaves plate ($7.95); kibbe, a combination of ground beef and milled wheat balls ($9.95); falafel plate ($6.95); and arayes, seasoned ground beef with onions, tomatoes and Armenian-style red hot pepper sauce spread over toasted pita ($4.95). 

 Besides Mediterranean food, Cafe International serves goulash ($7.95), Wiener schnitzel ($7.95), and a variety of Mexican dishes, including salads, burritos, tacos, quesadillas and enchiladas (prices range from $1.75 to $6.95). There also are American sandwiches ($4.95 each). 

 Baklava, a Greek dessert (75 cents), is among the restaurant's homemade dessert items. 

 No alcoholic beverages are served. 

 Cafe International is open 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays.

 Mad Cow Disease Risk Sparks Call For Wider Import Ban

 Australia should immediately ban imports of cattle, beef and beef products    from countries at risk of developing cases of mad cow disease, including Asia, a University of New England academic has warned. 

 Professor John Nolan also said a database of cattle semen and embryos should be established with the capability of tracing progeny, as the lethal Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) continues its spread through Europe. 

 The calls, to be made tomorrow at the biennial University of New England conference on recent advances in animal nutrition, come as the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) finalises its new certification process aimed at blocking any imported beef or beef products not scientifically proven to be BSE-free. 

 In the meantime, Australia continues to import beef products from Asia. This    is despite a ban since January on beef and beef products from 30 European countries, and the four-year ban on anything containing British beef. 

 Potentially BSE-infected meat-and-bonemeal protein supplements have been exported from Britain and Europe to Asia and elsewhere over the past decade. An ANZFA spokeswoman said beef imports from overseas ``total about 2 per cent of our total consumption''. 

 ``Certification, when it is announced later this month, will have a number of    categories and will place a worldwide ban on beef imports to Australia unless exporters can provide absolute proof of no BSE infection,'' she said. 

 The new categories will range from the BSE-free status given to Australia, New Zealand and nine other countries, through Asian and other countries which are at risk but have no known cases, to the other extreme    the countries including Britain and France with active BSE cases. 

 Already well established in western Europe, the first case of BSE in the Czech Republic was detected last month, and another, two weeks ago, became the first detected case in Greece. 

 After years of claiming to be a BSE oasis in Europe, Germany has detected more than 40 cases since late last year and is exporting beef to North Korea. BSE has an incubation period of up to five years. 

 Professor Nolan, from the animal science group of the UNE's school of rural science and natural resources, will argue that last year's decision by Australian quarantine authorities to relax importation restrictions on embryos and semen from cattle and sheep    some from countries that have had cases of BSE and its sheep equivalent, scrapie should be closely monitored. 

 And if the potential risk is deemed sufficient to warrant it, Professor Nolan    also suggests implementing random sampling and testing of the 23 million general cattle population. 

 Australia excludes live animal imports from all countries except the United States, Canada and New Caledonia, but cannot trace 24 of about 400 cattle and buffalo imported from Europe before 1989. Professor Nolan will also suggest at the conference an on-going review of the feeding of animal protein to non-ruminant livestock (pigs, chickens, even fish).

 Q My husband died last year and I want to know if there are any ways to make sure that as much of my estate passes to my children as possible. 

 FD Four Oaks 

 A YOU are quite right to organise your affairs so that needless Inheritance Tax is not paid, and there are a variety of ways to do this. The first stage is to make sure your will is up to date, and that you have nominated who you want to benefit. At the moment, Inheritance Tax will be payable at 40 per cent on the value of your estate over #242,000. This can mean that many people who don't consider themselves at all wealthy, but have a large property, will be caught. 

 If you make outright gifts and survive for seven years then these will not count as part of the estate, and you can also use your annual gift allowances to give away up to #3,000pa tax free. The rules for this are quite straightforward and it is an area that many people never consider. 

 Assets such as cash, stocks and shares, unit trust etc, are often thought to be difficult to deal with because if you give lumps of cash to your children as 'lifetime' gifts, then you lose control of the capital, and many people don't have enough money to do this as they may require an income to live on. 

 There are however, methods where you can still get an income from these assets and ensure that any growth on the money will fall outside your estate. A plan that could be used might be a 'Gift and Loan' scheme which is set up under a special trust. This could be ideal in your situation. A factsheet on Inheritance Trusts can be obtained by ringing 0800 544644. 

 Q I am interested in putting some money into an ethical investment. Can you tell me if the charges are any different to normal funds and are they good value for money? GR Great Barr 

 A The charges will vary according to which company you choose and some are better than others. Having said this, as with any investments, the charging structure is only one part of the equation to be considered. The most important part is how well they are likely to perform with your money. All funds can fluctuate in their performance. However, it is not difficult to find an ethical fund with longer term performance better than the average of non-ethical funds in the same investment sector. 

 Certainly over the past few years we have seen a lot more investment companies launching these types of funds to meet increased demand. Many of these ethical funds are available as an Individual Savings Account (ISA), so you can benefit from tax efficient savings as well as the green issue.

 Sterling hits new low in wake of elections

 Sterling took another volatile ride yesterday in the aftermath of U.K. elections, falling to a new 15-year low of US$1.3775 despite hopes for a rally on the Labour Party's landslide victory. 

 The euro faced weak German industrial production data, but was lifted slightly against the dollar by buying on the euro/sterling cross, while the dollar advanced on the yen on news that the Japanese government will likely downgrade its assessment of the economy. 

 Sterling's fall after a tentative recovery came early in London, after Conservative Party leader William Hague stepped down following the party's devastating losses. Mr. Hague, incumbent Prime Minister Tony Blair's rival, had campaigned chiefly on an anti-euro ticket, and his resignation sparked sentiment that another obstacle to the U.K.'s entry into the euro zone had been removed. 

 In other data, euro zone first-quarter economic growth was in line with expectations, rising 0.5% on the quarter and 2.5% on the year. 

 The euro was at US85.05 cents, up from US84.61 cents in London and from US85.00 cents in New York late Thursday. The dollar was at Y120.90, up from Y120.05 in London and from Y120.15 late Thursday in New York. 

 Against the dollar, sterling traded at US$1.3800, down from US$1.3912 late Thursday. Against the Swiss franc, the dollar traded at 1.7920 francs, flat from 1.7918 francs late Thursday. 

 The euro/yen cross got a boost following comments from Japanese Finance Minister Masajuro Shiokawa that economic activity in the second quarter will be weaker than in the first. 

 The Canadian dollar continued its strong run, closing at US65.80 cents from US65.72 cents on Thursday. The U.S. dollar closed at $1.5197 from $1.5217.

 Personal Finance - Drop in the ocean of with-profit policies.

 Wesleyan's actuary David Rutter has spoken out in defence of with-profit life policies after a report that the French owned colossus Axa had cut terminal bonuses on some of its policies by up to 70 per cent. 

 Like others, the Birmingham company, have had to cut the pay-outs on its maturing with-profit policies this year after the stock market fell by 11 per cent during 2000. 

 But the #9,568 paid on a ten-year Wesleyan policy costing a 29-year-old at the outset #50 a month, still represents a return of 9 per cent a year tax-free, in a decade when inflation averaged 2.5 per cent a year. 

 The #107,772 paid out on a similar 25-year policy represented a sharper drop - 5.4 per cent - because 1975 was one of the best years in the history of the stock exchange and it dropped out of the 25-year reckoning. 

 But the return of 13.5 per cent a year still handsomely outstripped inflation, averaging 4.4 per cent a year. 

 Mr Rutter explained that this 5.4 per cent cut in the pay-out was achieved by lowering the terminal bonus by 8 per cent. 

 The original sum assured under the policy and subsequent bonuses added to it each year cannot be taken away from the value. So, when a life company wishes to alter the pay-out in either direction, it can do so only by changing the terminal bonus. 

 'It depends how active a policy offices have got,' Mr Rutter said. 'We try to smooth it from year to year. 

 'Our funds had an excellent return in 2000 compared to markets as a whole because we were significantly under-weight in technology and telecoms stocks. 

 'In 1999, we were left out of the boom, but we were left out of the bust last year. We are buying into some selected technology companies now that we feel market values are more reasonable.' 

 A spokesman for Axa, which owns both Sun Alliance and Equity & Law, said the 70 per cent cut reported last week-end was an exceptional case. 

 It arose because a customer wanted to transfer a ten-year-old pension policy to another company when it still had more than five years to run. 

 At this stage, the terminal bonus accounts for only a small part of the total value of #130,000. The value of the policy had been cut by 6.5 per cent year-on-year, but this all had to come out of the terminal bonus, which was indeed reduced by 70 per cent. 

 'If he had kept it the proportion of the terminal bonus would have gone up,' the spokesman said. 

 'Terminal bonuses are calculated case by case. The issue will be how long a policy has been in force and whether it is being cashed in or transferred early.'.

 Rate cut may remind some homeowners to refinance.

 NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Wednesday's surprise rate cut by the U.S. central bank likely will not bring about a spike in home loan refinancings to kick up prepayments within mortgage securities, market participants said. 

 In fact, the cut in borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.50 percent may only serve as a reminder for home owners to save on borrowing costs by refinancing their loans. 

 While the surprise cut lowered short-term U.S. Treasury rates and mortgage bond spreads narrowed in the wake of the announcement, market watchers said a one day rally in U.S. government bonds probably won't fire up a protracted wave of prepayments. 

 Prepayments, "depend on the extent of the rally," said Art Frank, head of mortgage research at Nomura Securities International Inc. 

 Most observers said it was too soon to say what prepayments will do, but all agreed that they are watching the slope of the U.S. yield curve and dollar prices of mortgage debt. 

 Investors are watching dollar prices of mortgage securities, particularly current coupon mortgage bonds, to see if dollar prices jump above par, or $100. 

 When the current coupon mortgage bonds hit par, then consumers have a greater incentive to refinance their loans, resulting in a prepayment. The prepayment of a mortgage security forces bond holders to reinvest their cash in a less advantageous, lower yield environment. 

 At midday, current coupon Fannie Mae mortgage securities were up 15/32 at 99 16/32. 

 "6-1/2s are close to being par. If they remain near par, we'll continue to be in a refinance environment," said David Montano, director of mortgage strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. With 6-1/2s close to being par, "we are back to a very negatively convex mortgage market." 

 "If they go back to the vicinity of par, then you get a pickup in refinancings," said Frank. "If we get to around par, we get a fresh group of people refinancing." 

 Also, the steepening in the Treasury curve this morning promises to kick up demand for mortgage bonds because a steeper curve implies there may be a pickup in demand for pass-throughs used in the creation of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). 

 Meanwhile, the possibility of a prolonged period of refinancings has prompted calls for caution by at least one market player. 

 "We are clearly still in a refinance environment. Mortgage performance has been overly exuberant. They (mortgage securities) are too rich given prepayment risk and you're not getting compensated for this," said Montano. 

 Wednesday's surprise move by the Fed is sure to jolt some consumers into action, said market participants. 

 "Maybe a part of the Fed easing wakes people up to fact that rates are low," said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae. 

 "The rates may not go down, but this news might spur people" to refinance, said Dr. Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo.

 Jobs & Money - Women stand to get a better deal.

 Stakeholder pensions are good news for female workers, many of whom have been unable to join company pension schemes, says the TUC. 

 It has just published a free leaflet explaining why stakeholders will be ideal for millions of women. 

 "For too long, women have missed out on decent pension rights in the past. And with so many in part-time work and taking career breaks, they are still losing out," says TUC general secretary John Monks. "The flexibility of the new stakeholder pension scheme, due to go online next month, will be invaluable to these women. That's why we're making every effort to ensure they know all they need to about how the schemes will work." 

 For several reasons, women retire with pensions worth, on average, 85% of men's, says the TUC. 

 To start with, women generally earn less than men, so have less cash to put aside into a pension. Women also tend to take more time out of the labour market than men, perhaps to care for children or elderly relatives, and so have less time to build up a good pension. 

 Only 39% of women, compared with 52% of men, belong to company pension schemes and women are more likely to work for employers that do not offer a company scheme. Many women work part-time and in the past many pension schemes refused entry to part time or temporary workers. Also, until recently, women lost out on pensions if they divorced. 

 The flexibility of stakeholder plans means that many women will find them a useful way of saving for a pension for the first time: 

 You can stop and start contributions to a stakeholder as you wish, without incurring any financial penalty, making them ideal for women who work only during school term time, for example. 

 You don't have to be working to contribute to a stakeholder pension. People who are not working can pay up to #3,600 a year tax free into a plan, or get someone else to pay into a scheme on their behalf - ideal for women taking a career break to bring up a family. 

 Starting contributions to stakeholder pensions are low - payments can be made from as little as #20 a month, putting them more within the reach of many women on low incomes. 

 Stakeholder pensions offer an easy way for newly divorced women to start a pension. Under new legislation, women can take a share from their ex-husband's pension to kickstart their own. 

 Stakeholders can be used to top up an occupational pension scheme to make up for missing years when no contributions were made. This is useful to women who were late to join schemes or who spent time outside the labour market. 

 Copies of the new TUC leaflet 'Stakeholder pensions for women' are available free from TUC Publications on 020 7467 1294. There's more information at www.tuc.org.uk/stakeholder.

Pension off AVC rules; The Last Word

THE Government must review the rules governing top-up occupational pension schemes without delay.    

Additional voluntary contributions, or AVCs, look hopelessly out-of-date when compared with the brash new stakeholder pensions being launched next week.    

AVCs are used by millions to increase their occupational pensions. They have served their purpose well, especially where employers have subsidised the charges.    

But their weakness has been exposed in recent months. They are too inflexible because savers are often restricted in their choice of investment, and it is very difficult to move money once it is committed to a particular fund.    

And the tax rules are too restrictive. It is quite simply unacceptable that savers who choose stakeholder pensions can take a quarter of their fund as a tax-free lump sum while most of those who have started AVCs since April 1987 cannot take a single penny tax-free.    

If AVCs are to survive, then their rules must be brought into line with stakeholder. This means allowing savers to take a tax-free lump sum. It also means providing more flexible access to pensions and breaking the link between the mainstream company scheme and AVCs.    

People should be allowed to draw their AVC pension separately from their mainstream occupational pension, making phased retirement simpler. Currently the only way to do this is by using income drawdown, which is too risky for all but the wealthiest people.    

They should also be allowed to move their AVC savings independently if they are not happy with the investment performance of the fund. Until now AVCs have had a clear playing field, with expensive free-standing AVCs as their main opposition.    

But the world has moved on, and the Government must make it possible for AVC schemes to compete. Otherwise they will look increasingly unattractive and their days could be numbered.    

* SAVERS using with-profits schemes are being bludgeoned again. This time, some insurance companies are using obscure penalties called market value adjusters (MVAs) to reduce payments to people forced to cash in their savings policies or bonds early.    

Money Mail has warned about MVAs for many years, but the insurance industry has consistently played down the threat of them being used.    

With-profits are supposed to smooth returns, keeping money in reserve through good years so payments won't have to be cut in bad ones.    

Well, it appears that this rule no longer applies, at least for those who need to cash in early or wish to transfer their savings.    

Insurance companies will argue that the stock market falls mean savers cashing in early could be taking an unfair slice of the investment cake.    

But if with-profits policies can no longer smooth returns then investors would be better off with unit trusts and similar investment funds where they can see what their savings are worth on a daily basis, rather than having their returns decided on the whim of an actuary.

Gold Stocks Favoured As Telecom, Bank Shares Fall

Investors sought the safety of gold stocks and bonds yesterday, as concerns about the economy weighed on investor sentiment.

The All Ordinaries index fell 12.5 points to 3276.9, hurt by sharp falls in the influential telecom and the banking sectors.

Even the diversified resources sector, strong during the week due to the dollar's slump and offshore buying, dropped back as investors took profits.

Gold performed well on the day, boosted by a strong performance in overseas stocks and strength in the gold spot price.

Leading the ASX200 higher in percentage terms was Lihir Gold, up 4c to 68c, after a number of analysts returned from a mine site visit earlier in the week and updated recommendations.

Bullish research from UBS Warburg said the investment bank retained the view that Lihir was a world-class gold asset which was improving operational efficiency and benefiting from the improving price of gold.

Other strong gold stocksincluded Goldfields, up 7c to $1.55, Anglogold, $2.70 to $65.50, and Delta, up 5c to $1.32.

Werrie Gold was suspended as speculation continued that an extraordinary meeting will be called to seek approval for a share placement at 50c a share, followed by an acquisition. There was also talk, dealers said, of a deal with AOL Time Warner and a further capital raising at $1 a share.

Telstra led the drop in the telecom sector as investors banked profits amid political uncertainty and dealers described busy options activity. Telstra shed 11c to $6.59 with 15 million shares traded. Optus was off 7c at $3.80, Macquarie Telecom was down 5c to 40c and Open Telecommunications shed 6c to $1.06.

Advertising group Singleton slipped 1c to $3.86 after market sources said the company was raising about $25 million via a placement through Wilson HTM at about $3.50 a share. The funds will be used partly as working capital and partly to cover the partial selldown of shares by managing director Mr Russell Tate.

Media stocks were weaker amid fears the slowdown would weigh on advertising revenue. Fairfax fell 18c to $3.74 and PBL 39c to $11.81. News Corp gained 25c to $17.42 after Wall Street's strong run. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 128.6 points to 10,858.25.

FACT FILE

Telstra leads telecoms and the All Ords lower as extent of the economic downturn weighs on sentiment.

Gold stronger; the sector's safe-haven status attracts active buying.

Bonds also popular; the yield in the benchmark 10-year issue falls 7 points to 5.1pc a two-year low.

Wall of silence over 'flexible' Abbey fund    

SARAH PENNELLS

HOW would you feel if you had saved for retirement in a personal pension, but then faced paying a penalty of up to half the fund's value for moving it elsewhere?    

That is what happened to Ahmad Salam, an investment banker, who took out a personal pension with Abbey Life.    

He was sold the policy by an Abbey salesman in 1994, but had to stop contributing to it two and-a-half years later when he started a new job with a company that offered an in-house pension scheme.    

Ahmad, 40, from Putney, south-west London, thought there would be no problem stopping contributions and leaving the money with Abbey Life, or transferring it elsewhere. He recalls: 'When I took out my pension, I told the salesman that I changed jobs every couple of years and needed a flexible pension just in case I moved again.' The salesman seemed to have found him the perfect solution.    

In a letter to Ahmad, he said the pension would remain 'very flexible to contributions as you and I will review [it] at least once a year to take account of changing circumstances'.    

But when Ahmad moved jobs and wanted to stop payments, Abbey said it would charge him 3.5 per cent of the fund value a year on top of existing plan charges to leave the money where it was, or a hefty penalty that would reduce the fund value from Pounds 18,500 to a transfer value of Pounds 9,500 if he wanted to move it.    

In desperation, Ahmad contacted an independent financial adviser, Peter French of London-based Troy French and Partners, who negotiated a 'substantial reduction' in charges if the money stayed with Abbey.    

But last year, Ahmad's work circumstances changed once more and he thought again about transferring his pension elsewhere.    

About the same time, Abbey wrote saying its funds had become 'closed' to new business and it would not be taking on new clients. So he could not get advice from its salesforce.    

Allied Dunbar was taking over the salesforce, but it, too, could not advise him. Instead, Abbey recommended on the phone that he consult an independent adviser at his own expense.    

Ahmad is angry. He says: 'I have been left high and dry. No one is interested in me. Abbey has my money and that is all it's bothered about.'    

French believes Abbey has let down its pension policyholders. He says: 'These customers have already paid for ongoing advice in the form of up-front commissions on their pensions, but they are not getting it. They are left between a rock and a hard place over whether to pay a large penalty to move elsewhere, or a smaller one annually by leaving the money in a closed fund.'    

Abbey Life spokesman Robin Giles says the company has no plans to review charges on its policies, but says that Scottish Widows now runs its funds.

"You do need the support of a spouse that is like-minded," confides Leonard Barnes, the author of Property Power, who made his first million in eight years. "Two minds are better than one. Not only do you need the judgment of two individuals, but the back-up of research."

Mr Barnes set out to make a million dollars in 12 years by investing in property, mainly in Brisbane and Sydney. He achieved his target four years earlier than scheduled. So what's his secret?

A supportive partner comes top of his list. He also did a lot of research into property and its cycles, a medium he feels comfortable with.

"It wasn't really that hard. You need to work, study books, scan the newspapers - if it's something you enjoy, it's not a burden.

"You need to be a calculated risk taker - do your research and be confident it will pay off."

Mr Barnes favors the old-fashioned value of frugality. "I still drive a

10-year-old car worth about $10,000," he says. He loves his old Ford Capri convertible and thinks it is just as much fun, but a lot cheaper, than a new Saab convertible.

"There are two sorts of affluence: income affluence and asset affluence. The income affluent burn their money on holidays, restaurants, cars etc. They're really consumers - they don't accumulate assets."

Mr Barnes admits one of the downsides of making money through property was moving house so regularly. "My daughter had, at the age of seven, lived in six different houses. It was tough on her."

And now that he's a millionaire, what next? "A million bucks is not enough to stop at," Mr Barnes says. "I'd like to put another million together."

"At my age, I'm too young to retire," says the 45-year-old entrepreneur, who still holds down a part-time day job. He plans to devote more time to writing. In the current cycle, Mr Barnes believes there is nothing further to be gained from property and he has diversified into shares and bought part of a hotel.

He also admits to loosening the purse strings a little now. He, his wife and daughter took a trip around the world last year and had a stint on board the QE II. "We are starting to reward ourselves . . . but you can spend it pretty quickly."

He has always had a fondness for sailboats. He owns a boat that costs less than the average family car but is big enough to spend weekends on. It was during his honeymoon on the boat that he and his wife made a pact to make their fortune. They were inspired by the wealthy people they met on the high seas.

Mr Barnes says his philosophy is to achieve and have fun but not to do it at premium prices. How long will it take to make that next million?

 Comex Copper Settles Slightly Lower, Supported By Buying

 NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Copper futures on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange settled flat to slightly lower with profit-taking by smaller funds countered by trade buying, traders said.    

 Only one trader saw trading volume as even adequate, while most others blamed the narrow range copper has been trading in for the past month on lack of liquidity.    

 September futures were pressured lower earlier in the session due to an apparent switching of positions from September to December that was puzzling to some traders, who felt it premature to be getting out of September contracts.    

 "One fund has been buying September, which is why we've been higher this week," said a second trader in New York.    


(Comex prices at 1825 GMT in cents per pound and LME prices in dollars
per metric ton, with change from the previous day's Comex close and LME
evening evaluation and the day's trading range)
Comex  Sep  82.90      -0.05             82.25-83.25
       Dec  83.15      Unch              82.50-83.30
LME    3Mo. 1,800.00   -6.00          1,792.50-1,804.00
       Spot 1,775.75   -6.75
 


"The only real buyers and sellers are the funds. Over the last couple
of days, the 200-day moving average, which is a long-term average, was
broken and we got above 83 cents (per pound, basis September)," the
trader said. "That's when the buying came in but there was no
follow-through, so people sold out of their positions."
 


He didn't expect funds to come back in significant numbers unless the
market could get above and sustain itself above 83.50 cents per pound
for the September contract.
 


Any concerns about the U.S. economy cooling off were far outweighed,
he said, by evidence of consumption continuing to be strong in Europe
and Asia. He agreed with predictions of a supply deficit later in the
year if the growth in overseas economies seen in the first half of this
year extended to the latter half.
 


"People are starting to want to trade from the long side...but they
need another month or two of consumption figures to convince them we're
headed for a (supply) deficit," the trader noted.
 


"All the end-users say they're buying copper left and right, and a lot
of that is in anticipation of higher prices in the fourth quarter,"
noted dave Meger, senior metals analyst at Alaron Trading in Chicago.
 


Consumers locking in product for later in the year is what has kept
the copper market firm through what is customarily a slow season, "even
though it's not enough to drive us through 84 cents (per pound) in the
near term," he added.
 


Meger pegged support for September between 80 and 82 cents per pound
and resistance in the 83.50-cent to 84-cent range.

 Politics & Economy 
 Khatami Requires `Concrete' U.S. Acts For Rapprochement

 BERLIN -- On a trip meant to improve political and business ties with Europe, Iranian President Mohammed Khatami said a new relationship with the U.S. was possible too -- but only if Washington follows its recent softer tone toward Teheran with "concrete steps." 

 The first Iranian leader to visit Germany since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, Mr. Khatami was dogged by criticism of his country's human rights record, although street protests Tuesday ebbed in comparison with the thousands who demonstrated against Mr. Khatami's arrival Monday. 

 Mr. Khatami, a moderate cleric, has pursued cautious liberalization and opening to the West since his 1997 election -- overtures limited to Europe since the U.S. largely still shuns Iran. 

 But in an interview with television network ZDF, Mr. Khatami said he recognized a "new turn" in Washington, though the Clinton administration's dramatic shift did not go far enough. 

 "It's true the U.S. has admitted to having violated in the past our interests and the interests of our people, but no concrete steps have been undertaken to make up for this mistake of the past," he said. 

 "If the U.S. lets this admission be followed by deeds and also tries in practical policies to make up for the policies of the past . . . then we could proceed with good prospects for the relationship between both countries." 

 U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in a landmark speech in February, invited Iran to enter a "new relationship" with the U.S. to stabilize the Persian Gulf and reverse more than two decades of icy distance. While offering no direct apology, she acknowledged that past U.S. actions helped create an atmosphere of mistrust, citing the U.S. role in the 1953 overthrow of Iran's prime minister, its backing of the Shah and support of Iraq in its war with Iran in the 1980s. 

 Mr. Khatami said U.S.-Iran relations had "in part" improved in recent years, and said he continues to respect the "American people." "One knows where the problems are, but the key to clearing them away lies solely in the hand of the U.S.," he said. 

 Iran's relations with Europe, also strained by concerns about human rights and terrorism, have improved faster in recent years. 

 In a speech to business leaders Tuesday, Mr. Khatami urged German companies to invest in Iran and offered broad promises of economic reform, including measures to make sure foreign companies can repatriate profits. "Germany and Iran as partners know each other well and can look back on a long period of good relations," he said. "Our government will support any constructive step in this direction." 

 German Economics Minister Werner Mueller introduced Mr. Khatami as "a friend of our country" and encouraged him to "pursue your reform course resolutely." In a sign of the potential, German company Linde AG announced a 350 million euro deal to build a major petrochemical plant in Iran.

25-year capped rate to transform market; money mail

STANDARD LIFE Bank is bringing U.S.style home loans to the UK with the launch of a 25-year capped rate loan at 6.25 pc.    

The home loan deal, called Futureperfect, which goes on offer from June 16, could revolutionise lending in Britain by bringing borrowers long-term certainty with low interest.    

Capped rates set a limit on how high mortgage rates can rise but allow borrowers to benefit if rates fall below the cap.    

Standard Life calculates the average standard variable rate over the past 25 years has been 10.8pc. It says this long-term loan will protect borrowers from surging rates.    

A borrower with a Pounds 60,000 repayment loan over 25 years would pay a maximum of Pounds 400.47 a month compared with Pounds 458 if they were on a typical High Street standard variable rate of 7.74 pc.    

The market-leading five-year fixed rate from Cheltenham & Gloucester is set at 6.45 pc.    

Long-term fixed and capped rates are the norm in the U.S. and mainland Europe. Standard Life says that, in the U.S., 65 pc of all loans are taken out over a 30-year fixed basis.    

But even in the U.S., the average fixed-rate over this term is 8.3 pc.    

Ian Darby, of mortgage adviser John Charcol, says: 'This is a cracking product.    

'Many five-year fixed rates are above this and seem expensive in comparison.    

'It is difficult, in the short term, to see rates falling below the cap.    

And even if we join the euro and rates do fall, you can still benefit.'    

Penalties for early repayment of the loan run for the first five years of the loan. So borrowers can move on if they feel there is a better rate elsewhere.    

You need a 10pc deposit to qualify for the deal, with a maximum loan of Pounds 350,000.    

And there is a Pounds 350 application fee. But Standard will pay Pounds 200 towards your legal fees, and your valuation fee is refunded when you have completed.    

Neil Ross, managing director of Standard Life Bank, says: 'Many remember when interest rates hit 15 pc. We are offering mortgage payment certainty.'

Isa rise and fall    

SOME savers are earning a better rate of interest after changes in Woolwich's mini cash Isa. Those with more than Pounds 5,000 in accounts earn a tax-free 6.5 pc, a rise of 0.25 pc.    

But savers with less have suffered a fall.    

At Pounds 1, the rate is 5.75 pc and 6pc at Pounds 2,500.    

The fall comes because the bonus, offered to encourage savers into the account, ran out last week. While mini cash Isa savers with Pounds 5,000 plus earn 6.5 pc, the bank's Tessa customers earn 5.75pc at best.

 Bessemer Trust partners with DLJDirect to sidestep major tech enhancements

 Bessemer Trust, with about $30 billion in assets under management, signed a deal with DLJDirect at the end of March that allows Bessemer to offer its clients an online trading facility. While client assets are not necessarily flowing away from money management firms-very few high-net worth individuals would want to manage a $5 million-plus portfolio-many of them have been transferring 5 to 10% of their portfolios to online brokerages, money that could remain at the money management firm. Rather than cope with installing all the technology inhouse, and paying for the continual maintenance of its own online trading site, Bessemer partnered with an established online player, a decidedly quick and smart fix. 

 Hot on the heels of Charles Schwab & Co.'s acquisition of U.S. Trust, Bessemer adapted to the increasing pressure of the Web. Bessemer executives claim, though, that the move was not in response to the U.S. Trust deal as they have been talking to DLJ since last year. Mary Martinez, senior vice president at Bessemer, and in charge of the project, muses the firm has not been concerned too much with assets flowing away from it, but admits that Bessemer did see an opportunity in offering access to both managed and self-directed accounts from one Web site. 

 "We found that most of our clients wanted to have a self-directed product," Martinez explains. "If they have a managed portfolio, about 80 to 90% is managed, and they have 5 to 10% that is self directed. This is really a convenience to show clients all of their assets. It's very frustrating for high-net-worth clients to have to go to five different Web sites. What do I have at Schwab? What do I have at Bessemer?" 

 Martinez says the firm considered all the brokerages "you're familiar with" before settling on DLJDirect because of its technological and business acumen. "We wanted to be sure that we were partnering with someone that has cutting-edge technology, and someone that was committed," she advises. 

 Rather than sell itself-a la U.S. Trust-and rather than invest in an online infrastructure, Bessemer did the next best thing: partner with an online brokerage and piggy back off their technology and innovation. When the project is complete, clients will be able to click from the typical Bessemer Web site over to Bessemer Online, which effectively moves the user from Bessemer's servers over to DLJDirect's. Trades are executed and settled at DLJ and statements and confirmations are sent from DLJDirect. 

 All Bessemer had to do was set up an RJE line over which nightly batches are transmitted from DLJ into Bessemer's back office. According to Bessemer executives, the firm also had to enhance its reporting engine to accept these nightly batches. 

 Bessemer manages about $30 billion for more than 1200 clients who are required to have $5 million or more in investable assets.

Funds of wisdom from trust legend St Giles

DESPITE the agonisings of Gartmore's Paul Myners, according to one of his rivals running an investment fund looks to be the best career bet of the 21st century.    

That is why Mark St Giles, one of the legendary figures of the unit trust industry, has produced an exhaustive "how to" guide on forming and running a collective investment fund anywhere in the world.    

St Giles - whose West Country family was plain Giles until one of his ancestors simply decided to embellish the name - says: "The vigorous growth of collective investment funds is a global phenomenon, and not confined to developed countries."    

The total market value of such funds is Pounds 5400 billion, two thirds held by Americans.    

But Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic each boast fund industries worth Pounds 600 million and others are catching up fast as disposable income spreads around the world.    

St Giles cut his teeth on an extensive tour of the City, running Allied Hambro, GT Management and Framlington, and serving a stint as chairman of the old Unit Trust Association.    

But for the past seven years he has headed Cadogan Financial, an adviser on the financial sector to the World Bank and more than 25 emerging countries.    

He has no doubt which country investment promoters should avoid - Russia.    

The privatisation funds of the Gorbachev era, which lured about 25 million hopefuls, simply disappeared."It's all very sad," he said. "Russia has run out of money and run out of road.    

"People don't even keep their money in banks, it's mainly in dollar bills under the mattress. So they are hardly going to trust a foreign fund manager who asks to handle their savings."    

The gambling-mad Chinese are also wary. Although there are more than 10 million investors, that is a tiny proportion of a population of 1.3 billion.    

Most people keep their money in banks, even at an interest rate of 3%.    

Says St Giles: "The government is tearing its hair out trying to persuade them to invest.    

Meanwhile the banks are struggling with Pounds 70 billion of bad loans and shrinking capital, making some technically insolvent.    

According to the much-travelled St Giles, the problem for developing countries - and the fund management trade - is giving savers the confidence to extend their time horizons.    

Brazil's investment funds handle a respectable Pounds 60 billion, but much of that is committed to money market holdings maturing in no more than 90 or 120 days.    

One answer is to bolster confidence by strengthening investor protection.    

"Many of the countries whose investment fund industries have suffered malpractice or fraud are busy revising their legislation and tightening supervision," St Giles reports, "but growth looks likely to continue and even accelerate as governments increasingly encourage citizens to make provision for their own old age."    

Managing Collective Investment Funds, priced at Pounds 92.50, is published by Cadogan Financial.

 Managed & Personal Investing: Money Managers' Noticeboard

 Magellan Fund Manager Nibbles on Tech Stocks 

 Robert Stansky, manager of Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund, appears to be taking a somewhat less cautious approach toward technology stocks. 

 As of Jan. 31, the world's largest mutual fund had 30.5% of its assets in technology, compared with 29.2% for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, according to Fidelity's March mutual-fund guide. Of course, Fidelity Magellan Fund, which had $100.8 billion of assets at the end of February, isn't making a huge bet compared with several other large Fidelity stock funds. Its Fidelity Aggressive Growth and Fidelity Growth Company, for example, have about half their investments in technology. 

 But last year, Mr. Stansky was underweighted in technology because of concerns about high share prices-which meant he lost ground relative to more bullish peers. At year end, Magellan had 27.1% of its assets in technology, compared with the S&P 500's 29.4%. 

 Still, managers at Fidelity, Boston, clearly aren't all in lock step. Will Danoff, manager of $46.5 billion-in-assets Fidelity Contrafund, reduced his tech weighting to 21% from 24.4% at year end. (Staff) 

 Amerindo to Spawn New Funds 

 Amerindo Investment Advisors Inc. said it will spawn three new funds during the next several months. In addition, it announced plans to close its flagship Amerindo Technology when the fund reaches $1.5 billion in assets. Currently, assets in that fund are about $820 million. The new funds will include Amerindo Technology II, which will follow an investment philosophy similar to the original fund's, but follow newer names, the firm said. The firm also filed papers with the Securities and Exchange Commission to open the Amerindo B2B Fund, which will focus on Internet companies in the business-to-business market, and the Amerindo Health & Biotechnology Fund, which will invest in biotechnology and Internet health-care companies.

 Stock Funds Net $363 Million 

 NEW YORK -- U.S. equity funds grabbed just $155 million (160.5 million euros) on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday with market swoons slowing inflows, according to TrimTabs.com investment research. Funds that invest in international equities took in $208 million in fresh cash, bring total inflows into all stock funds to $363 million. In a sign that investors still have a taste for the most volatile returns, aggressive-growth funds snatched $6.23 billion in new cash. Meanwhile growth funds bled $1.79 billion and more conservative growth and income funds suffered $4.29 billion in redemptions. During the three-day period, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.57%, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index inched up 0.74%. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.89% and the small-cap Russell 2000 edged up 0.74%. All but one of the bond fund categories that TrimTabs.com tracks recorded outflows, with investors pulling a total of $2.2 billion from the group. (Dow Jones)

 WWF's Net Jumps by 54%, Beats Estimates

 NEW YORK -- Citing the popularity of its live wrestling events, television programs and Internet sites, as well as strong sales of licensed merchandise, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. posted fiscal third-quarter results beyond Wall Street's expectations. 

 The sports-entertainment company also issued a bullish forecast, projecting per-share earnings growth of 37% for the fiscal year ending April 30. 

 The Stamford, Conn., company reported pro-forma net income for the quarter ended Jan. 28 of $15.7 million, or 23 cents a diluted share, up 54% from pro-forma net of $10.2 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of 18 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Revenue jumped 51% to $98.4 million from $65.2 million. 

 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization rose 36% to $24.1 million from $17.7 million. 

 The company ended the quarter with $243 million in cash, compared with $28 million a year earlier. 

 Live- and televised-entertainment revenue increased 42% to $65.9 million, with advertising revenue up $12.1 million and pay-per-view revenue up $1.9 million. Branded-merchandise revenue surged 72% to $32.5 million. 

 Revenue from the company's Internet operations ballooned to $3.7 million on significant increases in advertising and online sales. According to PC Data Online, a Reston, Va., market-research firm, visitors to WWF.com and its 11 related sites more than doubled to 3.4 million in January from a year earlier. 

 Linda McMahon, WWF's president and chief executive, said results reflect the company's success in attracting men age 18 to 34 and more young women. 

 She also said the company aims to expand its operations to include a record label, while plans for a professional football league are progressing. 

 "We are now in active negotiations with a number of potential and highly supportive TV partners to broadcast two to three games a week for the full 13-week season, including playoffs," Ms. McMahon said. She expects the league to be launched in February 2001. 

 WWF is expected to offer its football broadcasts to either the UPN network, which has had huge success with "WWF Smackdown," or USA Networks Inc.'s cable channel, which also carries WWF programming. UPN is owned by Viacom Inc. and Chris-Craft Industries Inc. 

 WWF's stock has slid recently on worries the recently announced football venture will be difficult to pull off. At 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, WWF was up $1.375, or 12%, to $13, still shy of its initial-public-offering price of $17. 

 The company raised its pro-forma growth target to 37%, excluding a noncash charge taken in the second quarter, from 24% for fiscal 2000. WWF had pro-forma net income of 59 cents a share for fiscal 1999, which ended in April. Analysts expect earnings of 77 cents a share for fiscal 2000, according to First Call.
