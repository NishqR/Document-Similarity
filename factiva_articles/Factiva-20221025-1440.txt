TORONTO, April 3 /CNW/ -- TORONTO, April 3 /CNW/ - Altamira Investment Services today announced the launch of the Altamira SMART Note. The SMART Note is an innovative investment solution that offers fully protected principal and unlimited potential return at maturity, over a seven-year term.    

The SMART Note consists of three portfolios, each allocated differently to represent varying levels of risk tolerance: conservative, balanced and growth. These portfolios are diversified among the four most common asset classes (equities, bonds, commodities and currencies). When the Note matures, investors will automatically receive the return from the best performing of all three portfolios at the end of a seven-year term, plus their initial investment. If there is not a positive return on any of the portfolios, investors will get their initial investment back.    

"The market is constantly changing. The SMART Note allows investors peace of mind, without having to spend time worrying about the right portfolio mix and adjusting it to market conditions. In addition, the SMART Note's asset allocation strategy allows the full spectrum of investors, ranging from conservative to aggressive, to benefit from unlimited potential return at maturity," said Ian Dillon, chief investment strategist for Altamira.    

The issue price is $100 per note with a minimum investment of $500. At maturity, on May 31, 2013, investors may be paid, in addition to their principal, a positive unlimited return corresponding to the best performance of the three portfolios. The Note is eligible for RRSP, RRIF and RESP investments.    

The Note can be purchased until May 26, 2006 directly from an Altamira Advisor by calling 1-888-ALTAMIRA or by visiting one of our investor centres across Canada. The complete terms of the offering can be found in the Information Statement. Additional details and the Information Statement are available at    www.altamira.com .    

Altamira Investment Services is a leading provider of financial and retirement planning services. We offer a wide range of investment solutions including mutual funds, savings accounts, principal-protected notes and managed portfolio services. Award-winning client service, product innovation and expert advice define Altamira's distinctive approach to investment management. The company is headquartered in Toronto with offices across the country, and is a subsidiary of the National Bank of Canada.    www.altamira.com 

The Systematic Maximum Allocation of Returns (SMART) Note is a principal-protected investment redeemable at maturity. Any change in the return of the reference portfolios, which correspond to a change in the return of the underlying assets, will have a direct impact on the return payable. It is possible that no return will be paid. An investment in the Note is subject to a number of risk factors. The complete information related to this issue of the Notes is included in the Information Statement which is available upon request and will be sent to investors. Potential purchasers should consult the Information Statement before investing in the Notes.

CHANCELLOR FINALLY DOES REIT THING

CHANCELLOR Gordon Brown has done the REIT thing for property investors.    

After two years of deliberations, he has at last cleared the way for Real Estate Investment Trusts, relaxing some of his earlier curbs and allowing property companies to switch their assets into REITs at the cost of a 2pc levy.    

That is generous, but the levy is on firms' gross assets. For giants like British Land it could cost up to £300m. But it can be spread over four years and is a price many will be willing to pay.    

Once properties are moved into a REIT, all the tax advantages of an investment trust kick in.    

Properties can be sold free of capital gains tax and rental income is free of corporation tax, provided the trusts pay out 90pc of their earnings.    

This should enable them to pay attractive dividends and become a popular vehicle for ordinary investors. The Treasury says they should qualify for Isas and Peps.    

Investors like property, which has delivered great returns for a decade. But apart from buying a flat or office directly, there were woefully few ways in, yet demand is huge.    

REITs should be a big help. The taxpayer should gain too, as properties are traded more frequently, boosting stamp duty revenues.    

The main beneficiaries will be major property companies. Shares in British Land, Hammerson, Land Securities and others soared on Budget day.    

British Land's chief operating officer, John Weston Smith, says companies will need to see the small print of the regulations, due in summer.    

'This is a very good start,' he says. 'There is quite a lot of detail to be settled, but the idea has clear merits and we think it should be attractive to investors'.    

The big gain should be higher dividend payouts.    

Others with a property portfolio will be tempted - Tesco is already having a look. Ports, banks, and some builders, defence and water firms might hive off their properties. For developers, REITs are less tempting than for those with rental income from a mature property portfolio.    

Dividend gains could be startling. Alistair Gunn at broker Arbuthnot thinks AB Ports' payout could double, lifting its yield to 5.8pc.    

Bidders need to move before their targets shift assets into a REIT - where no one can effectively own more than 10pc.    

Expect a flow of REIT launches from early 2007.    

The snag is that property prices have already risen greatly.    

Rental yields on offices are not far above 5pc, close to financing costs of about 4.8pc. If the gap closes, funds will stop buying.    

Merrill Lynch analysts rate £9bn giant Land Secs as potentially the most attractive dividend play. At £19.89 the shares are not cheap, but could have more upside.    

Investment trust TR Property (2093/4p) has an excellent record and a well spread portfolio.    

All praise to the Chancellor for a bold step - though he knows that without it more property funds would have moved offshore.

Budget 2006: A-Day - IHT rules look positive but 'family Sipps' fall foul

The government has backed down on plans to levy inheritance tax (IHT) on the unused pension assets of younger pensioners but a crackdown on over-75s has effectively killed off the notion of family Sipps.    

HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) announced in the Budget that current IHT rules will continue to apply to most pension schemes after A-Day on 6 April.    

This effectively gives the all-clear for pensioners aged under-75 who are drawing down cash through an unsecured pension (USP) to pass on money to family and friends tax free.    

Instead it has concentrated its efforts on those aged over 75 who must use so-called alternatively secured pensions (ASP) if they do not want to take out an annuity.    

Left-over funds from ASP will be included in a savers estate for inheritance tax purposes although, in another concession, the Government is to allow any IHT bill to be paid out of the pensions cash to avoid the family having to find money from elsewhere.    

The exceptions are assets being passed onto a spouse, civil partner, dependants or to charity which will transfer free of IHT, the government said.    

Non-exempt sums will also be subject to the IHT threshold which the Chancellor announced is to increase from £275,000 to £325,000 over the next four years.    

Iain Naismith, head of pensions market development at Scottish Widows, said: It looks as if the government has conceded on IHT for those under 75.    

Before the government said that if someone was doing USP they would presume they intended to roll over into ASP.    

Effectively what they are doing is making current practice into legislation.    

But he said that he was concerned about rules that mean funds passed onto a spouse, partner or dependant will revert to being treated as part of the original scheme members estate when they die.    

In the meantime the estate may have been wound up. If the executors are long gone how can an administrator of the scheme identify the IHT liability? he said.    

Naismith believes the changes mean that ASP will only be attractive for those people who are desperate to avoid taking out annuities that, thanks to falling gilt yields, have dropped in value over the last few years.    

Malcolm Cuthbert, managing director of financial planning at stockbroker Killik, said the rules had killed off any notion of family Sipps where assets from one scheme member were passed onto other members.    

Bruce Angus, director of financial services at Brewin Dolphin also criticised the government as the full details of the IHT rules will only appear in the Finance Bill long after pension simplification comes into force on 6 April.    

While USP and ASP are both forms of income drawdown they differ in that someone in USP, which is available only to those under 75, can take income equivalent to 120% of a single life annuity. This drops to 70% in ASP.

EXCHANGE TRADED FUNDS
Advisers Urge Caution When Trading Options

Two new funds tracking the CBOE BuyWrite Index have moved to the head of the class.    

The idea behind the S&P 500 Covered Call Fund seems straight forward. It invests in stocks mirroring the S&P 500. It also sells call options on the benchmark. That means investors get a return whether the stocks go up or down.    

A sister fund, the Enhanced S&P Covered Call Fund, uses swap contracts along with covered calls. In the past week and month, both funds have been moving up IBD's list of top performing ETFs.    

But some advisers are cautioning investors. For one, the funds have a short track record. And money managers aren't so sure either fund's passive strategy is the best way to implement options trading in a fund format.    

The funds are set up similar to closed-end funds. That means they can sell at a discount or premium to their net asset value.    

Trades At Discount    

Right now, the Enhanced S&P Covered Call Fund is trading at a 5.57% discount. The other fund is selling at a 5.05% discount. Those numbers represent the difference between each fund's market price and NAV. "Just like most closed-end funds, they sold at a premium when introduced last March," said Roger Nusbaum, an adviser at Your Source Financial.    

At least 20 closed-end funds are also trading at attractive discounts, he says. Those are actively managed, which is a key reason he's not investing in the new passively managed funds.    

Investors interested in a covered-call fund should realize they are limiting their upside potential, says Jon White, chief investment officer at Beacon Hill Financial. "Your gains are essentially capped because you've sold the right for someone else to buy your holdings at a certain price," he said. "If the market keeps going up, you won't be able to participate as fully."    

Limits Downside    

If the market drops, you can limit losses.    

For example, if you sell an option at $1 and the fund has dropped $5 in price, you'll lose $4 instead of $5.    

A covered-call fund has one sure bet going for it. Namely, your investment will gain increased yield no matter which way the market goes.    

"These types of funds are usually sold as income-generating vehicles," said White. "They're most popular with very conservative fund investors."    

He prefers to buy options himself, picking and choosing specific names as well as times to use the tactic with funds.    

Cary Carbonaro, president at Family Financial Research, agrees. She also questions whether buying an index-based ETF that automatically sells options every month is a wise idea.    

"Instead of buying a passively managed covered-call fund, why not just put a stop-loss order when you make an ETF purchase?" said Carbonaro. "That doesn't cost anything and it won't limit your upside."

Market Wrap - Money
Resurgent $US roughs up Aussie

The Australian dollar fell to a two-month low yesterday as the US dollar chalked up significant gains against a range of commodity currencies.

The greenback has risen sharply against the euro and high-yielding currencies this week, supported by the steady push higher of long-term interest rates in the US.

In late afternoon trading the local unit was fetching US73.43¢, down from US73.78¢ the day before.

It reached a high of US73.46¢ in the day but also traded down to US73.18¢, its lowest this year since touching US73.16¢ on January 3.

RBC Capital Markets senior economist Su-Lin Ong said the Australian dollar retreated after the US dollar strengthened and commodity prices softened.

She said there was talk the US Federal Reserve might lift interest rates further than previously thought. "There is some speculation that maybe they will go above 5 per cent," she said. "That's helped the US dollar a little and seen most other currencies come off."

US interest rates are at 4.5 per cent following a long series of rises.

Fed officials, responding to consistently strong economic data, signalled this week the federal funds rate would continue to rise to ward off inflation.

Markets now see some risk of the Fed lifting rates as high as 5.25 per cent, against previous expectations for a possible peak at 5 per cent.

In contrast, the local dollar was also hit by the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision to keep the official cash rate at 5.5 per cent, 12 months after a 25 basis point rise in March last year.

Traders are betting there will be no change to domestic rates in 2006, ensuring further erosion in the Aussie dollar's yield advantage as euro zone and US interest rates rise and as Japan prepares to tilt policy in favour of an eventual rate rise.

The sentiment has driven the yield on 10-year US treasuries to 21-month highs of about 4.75 per cent earlier this week, while the spread between two-year Australian government bonds and US treasuries yesterday narrowed to 55 basis points, the lowest since March 2001.

However, the local economy is expected to gather pace this year, with business investment solid and lifts in consumer spending and exports forecast. As a result, the RBA is expected to retain its slightly aggressive posture on rates. JPMorgan chief economist Stephen Walters said a pick-up in consumer spending in 2007 could again leave the annual headline inflation rate around the top of the RBA's 2 per cent to 3 per cent comfort zone.

Chatter on bond trading desks also focused on a possible sell-off in US treasuries if US yields broke through 4.9 per cent - viewed by many as a long-term support level, which could further affect the Australian dollar, already tipped by many analysts to sink below $US70¢ in coming weeks.

AROUND THE HOUSES

Property

HOUSE-swapping - an option open to both the homebuyer and seller - can have considerable advantages. The most important ones are saving money on estate agency fees and avoiding a chain, which is a major cause of house sales collapsing. A 'swap' label on advertisements for the property conveys the 'no chain' message and can attract potential buyers.

The process is legal, and the transaction follows the same conveyancing procedures as would apply in a standard sale.

It is essential for both homes to be professionally valued to ensure any balancing payment required is fair.

Leamington Spa-based Mavis Wilson swapped homes after being widowed and deciding to downsize from her three-bed semi to a smaller house nearer her grandchildren's home.

Fortunately, at the same time, Helen and Don Gardener were living in a two-bedroom starter home close to Mrs Wilson's grandchildren, and were looking for a larger home.

Both had failed to sell their homes by conventional methods and were therefore pleased to be contacted by Peter Cooke of Swap-Homes. com who suggested that they literally 'swap homes'. The process took just seven weeks.

"I'd thoroughly recommend swapping homes, for several reasons, " said Helen, 39. "It's speedy, you feel certain of your buyer and there isn't the worry and inconvenience of a chain." The disadvantage of swapping rather than selling your house is the extra difficulty there can be in finding someone happy to make a swap, and also in reaching agreement of the extra amount needed to be paid by one party if one property is worth more than the other, as is likely.

Swap-Homes. com is a new website, launched to match UK homeowners wanting to exchange their homes.

The property they wish to sell is registered on the website along with the requirements of the home they would like to own. A database of other registered properties is then searched daily to identify possible swaps. The site registered almost 1,000 properties in the first three weeks and the number grows daily.

It is important to bear in mind that if you found out about the other home from an estate agent representing the existing owners, then their contract with the estate agent will undoubtedly require them to pay the estate agent's fee.

However, if your estate agent did not introduce your house to the eventual buyers (or if you have not employed an estate agent) then you should be able to agree a private sale of your house and thus save any agent's fee. If only one of you saves money on agent's fees by exchanging houses then the other will, understandably, want a share of the saving.

Until recently, stamp duty was normally only payable on the amount of any balancing payment but in 2003 the Government introduced stamp duty land tax and now both owners are required to pay stamp duty on the full value of the property acquired.

Financial Adviser: A-Day errors likely to be rife, expert warns.

(c) 2006 Financial Adviser    

MISCALCULATIONS of tax-free cash entitlements by advisers and accountants are likely to be widespread as A-Day approaches, according to a pensions expert.    

Phil McGovern, a director for Warwickshire-based MPA Financial Management, said: "In the last week I have seen a number of errors made in calculations that I have been asked to look over by advisers and accountants."    

He said that he had recently seen one client who was told that he was entitled to a tax-free cash lump sum of AGBP250,000 after A-Day.    

Mr McGovern recalculated the figure and said the client was entitled to less than half of this figure.    

He said: "This mistake was made by someone who is good at their job. It was checked and it was spotted -" but how many will not be? If this figure had not been sent for a second opinion, the client would have got a nasty shock when his AGBP250,000 cheque never materialised."    

Under current regulations, IFAs are not required to hold a G-60 pensions qualification unless they are giving advice on transferring from an occupational pension.    

According to Mr McGovern, only 5000 to 8000 of the entire community of financial advisers hold G-60s and those who do not are still able to give pensions advice.    

He said: "I am sure there are many advisers that do not have the skills to calculate the tax-free cash entitlements of their clients."    

He said: "When calculating the maximum tax-free cash on an executive pension or small self-administered scheme, the maximum tax-free cash available to be protected is the Inland Revenue maximum allowed at A-Day.    

"A number of advisers I have spoken to recently have wrongly assumed that it is the maximum available at the client's normal retirement date."    

Mr McGovern added: "A lot of people still think that as long as a member joined his scheme before 17 March 1987, he can take the maximum tax-free cash of 150 per cent of his final salary after 10 years' service.    

"This is only correct at the client's normal retirement date. If he retires earlier than the normal retirement date, there is a penalty applied to the tax-free cash. In respect of A-Day calculations you have to assume that A-Day is the early retirement date."    

In a fictional example, Mr McGovern showed how vital these calculations were, demonstrating that some customers could receive much higher percentages of their fund's value than the 25 per cent allowed for a personal pension after A-Day.    

Mr McGovern said this could be protected in two ways. He said: "Do nothing and it will be automatically protected, or transfer to a Section 32 buy-out bond where it will also be protected.    

"After A-Day you could cash in the tax-free cash and carry on working with the same company which is a change from current regulations."

'Sliding' rate triggers compensation

AMONG the choices offered to me for reinvesting my Halifax Isa was a four year, fixed term option at 5.7pc. I duly phoned when its offices reopened after the weekend and was told this rate was no longer available. I protested that to send out forms which must have been obsolete when posted was not good business practice. I was persuaded to arrange a meeting with an investment adviser at my local branch. The adviser recommended some extra investments but agreed with me that reinvesting my Isa at the current rate of 5.4pc was still a good idea. During a second meeting I signed a form agreeing to reinvest this money in this way.    

L M, High Wycombe, Bucks    

FOUR days later your original Isa matured and the adviser rang to confirm that you were happy with the paperwork. A week later a letter arrived saying the money had been invested in a variable rate Isa. You phoned to correct this. You were reassured that your statement had a fixed term Isa paying 5.4pc. Instead you received a replacement confirmation document quoting an interest rate of 4.5pc and were horrified to be told the rate had fallen on the very day your earlier Isa had matured. You tried very hard to sort this out, but received no response. When you checked the Halifax website a week after the Isa interest rate had apparently changed, the 5.4pc fixed rate was still being advertised.    

In fact, only on the day I received your letter and spoke to Halifax was the rate reduced to 4.5pc. Eleven days after being told an area manager would contact you, nothing had happened.    

As a result of this column's involvement, the bank is allowing you the 5.4pc rate. pounds 100 was sent for goodwill and some flowers, but it took a further four weeks for the duplicate Isa document quoting the correct fixed rate to materialise. Further prompting from me increased the compensation to pounds 225.    

Many readers complain that the financial institutions that are keen to take their money are less willing to answer legitimate questions. Sometimes the power of the press, in the shape of Jessica Gorst-Williams, can help    

Because of the volume of mail received, it is not possible to respond to every letter and correspondence cannot be entered into. Please do not send original documents or stamped and addressed envelopes. Responsibility, legal or otherwise, for answers given cannot be accepted. Cases currently with an ombudsman, going through a court of law or sent to other columns will not be considered.

TAX

Testamentary trusts pay children tax-efficient incomes that could continue for many years.

Astute baby boomers are increasingly turning to special estate-planning trusts long favoured by the super rich as a way for beneficiaries under 18 to save large amounts of tax. Testamentary trusts are provided for in wills and are brought into existence by the benefactor's death. The benefactor's will specifies that particular assets or money be transferred into a testamentary trust, naming children or grandchildren as beneficiaries. Income flowing from the trust is taxed at adult marginal tax rates instead of the high rates that generally apply to the unearned income of children.

Income distributed to minors from a testamentary trust has the advantage of the adult tax-free threshold of $6000 as well as the stepped-up adult marginal rates. By contrast, the unearned income of minors, which includes most types of trust income and investment income, is generally taxed at the top rate of 48.5% with a tax-free threshold of just $772.

A tax consultant with the accountants Horwath NSW, Chantal Olz, gives an example of how a wealthy person could save tens of thousands of dollars in tax each year for her four grandchildren by providing in her will for $4 million to be placed in a testamentary trust. After the benefactor's death, the testamentary trust pays each of her grandchildren $100,000 a year, attracting tax of $32,125 each or a total of $128,500.

Writing in the Weekly Tax Bulletin, published by Thomson ATP, Olz says the four grandchildren would pay a total of $194,000 in tax each year if the income were not received through a testamentary trust. The trust saves them $65,500 in tax each year, a sum that would greatly multiply if the trust were operating for a few years. Testamentary trusts are tax-effective even with more modest sums.

The managing partner of Brett Davies Lawyers in Perth, Brett Davies, says testamentary trusts are a way for people making a will to gain tax advantages for their beneficiaries and to "control from the grave how their assets are distributed and managed".

A chapter on estate planning in the Australian Financial Planning Handbook, published by Thomson ATP, points out that children will pay no tax on their distributions from a testamentary trust if their individual income is below the $6000 adult tax-free threshold.

The director of tax at Horwath NSW, Les Szekely, says testamentary trusts are also a valuable way of gaining some protection for family assets from possible future claims by creditors or other litigants seeking damages against family members. He gives the example of elderly parents who do not want to leave assets to an adult child who is in financial difficulties, and instead want to establish a testamentary trust with their grandchildren as beneficiaries. Szekely says the assets of testamentary trusts must, under tax law, eventually vest in the beneficiaries.

creditcards: Take care when you shuffle your cards

Transferring debts to reduce credit card repayments is the sensible option but watch for hidden costs in the small print    

ATTHIS time of year, there can be few more appealing phrases than "zero per cent interest".    

With the average credit card charging around 15 per cent a year, transferring your debt to one offering an interest-free period could save you hundreds of pounds.    

Financial comparison website Moneysupermarket.com says someone who owed £2500 on an Egg card with an annual percentage rate (APR) of 15.9 per cent, and made the minimum two per cent monthly repayment, could save £356 over 12 months by transferring to Halifax One, which charges zero per cent for a year and 15.9 per cent after that.    

So it's no wonder many people are planning to move their card debts.    

According to issuer Capital One, more than 3.3million - over 10 per cent of all cardholders - aim to transfer balances averaging £2338 each. That's a total of £7.9billion during the first three months of this year.    

Moneysupermarket's director of credit cards, Richard Mason, says: "The key benefit of switching to a zero per cent deal is that all of the monthly repayment goes towards clearing the balance outstanding and, therefore, the debt can be cleared much quicker."    

There's certainly no shortage of deals to choose from, with around 30 providers offering interest-free transfers lasting at least five months.    

But that doesn't mean they are all equally good, or that they will suit everyone. Make the wrong choice and you could end up paying far more than you bargained for.    

To work out a card's true cost, you must take into account:    

the length of the interest-free period    

the long-term rate once this ends    

any exclusions in the small print    

whether there's a balance transfer fee    

whether this charge is capped    

Halifax One and SkyCard charge no interest on transfers for 12 months' while others, including Abbey, Alliance & Leicester, Barclaycard, Egg, HSBC, MBNA, SonyCard and Virgin, have nine-month deals. Meanwhile, Mint is offering up to 16 months interest-free, but the way this is structured means it isn't as generous as it might seem.    

New cardholders pay no interest on transfers and purchases until November 1, when the rate rises to 14.9 per cent.    

Then in January 2007, in the unlikely event they have built up a balance on another card, they can move this to Mint too and pay no interest until July 1.    

Existing Mint balances or those on cards issued by linked groups, such as the Royal Bank, don't qualify for the second part of the offer, so holders will continue to pay interest on these.    

Also, like many providers, Mint has a two per cent fee for each transfer.    

Most are capped at £50 - Mint's maximum is £49 - but be warned ... some charge the whole two per cent.

Hobbs' priceless advice

CASH-strapped consumers submerged in debt after Christmas are being offered a lifeline - by Eddie Hobbs.

The TV finance whiz won the hearts of the nation last year by declaring war on dodgy retailers.

Nearly 750,000 viewers tuned in to his controversial RTE show Rip-Off Ireland. His lifestyle programme Show Me The Money, which returned this month, is also a ratings winner.

And now Corkman Eddie, 44, is on a mission to wipe out YOUR debts.

Here he gives 20 invaluable tips on how to get back in the black AND increase your savings to make 2006 your most prosperous year ever.

EDDIE'S TOP 20 TIPS

1.MAKE a pledge with yourself to eliminate your debts - and set a date for reaching your target.

2.WRITE a list of all your debts, starting with the biggest amounts.

3.CALCULATE how much interest you're paying for each debt every month and add up the total. This figure is your lifestyle debt - the one you want to eliminate.

4.KEEP a cash diary for the month. Carry a notebook and note how much money you spend every day to see exactly where your dosh is going.

5.LIST all your necessary spending (ESB, mortgage, car etc) and unnecessary spending (clothes, eating out, holidays, etc) - the total tells you if you are living beyond your means.

6.CUT up your credit card - you're less likely to overspend if you're handing over real cash.

7.WALK instead of taking buses or taxis. It's good for your health too.

8.CHANGE expensive habits. If you go shopping when you're bored, find something else to occupy your time like reading or running.

9.TELL family and friends about your debt-busting new lifestyle - they can support you, offer advice and keep you from temptation.

10. ASK a credit union about consolidating all your loans into one payment at a competitive interest rate.

11. STOP phoning and text instead - check out rates at www.callcosts.ie    .

12. KEEP your old car. They're designed to last for up to 15 YEARS.

13. MOVE your cash around. It's daft to pay high interest on card debts if you have money sitting in a low-interest savings account.

14. BOOK a last-minute holiday to bag a bargain.

15. REDUCE your booze intake - the Irish spend between ten and 15 per cent of their income on alcohol!

16. SMOKING 20 fags a day costs Euro 3,000 a year. So QUIT!

17.DIP into your SSIA money to clear as much debt as possible.

18. KEEP an eye on your kids' spending on things like mobile phones. If they must have one, limit the amount of credit they are allowed.

19.CHECK around for better deals on insurance. You may be surprised.

20. CONTACT your local Money Advice and Budgeting Services office for more help.

Brown's Sipps U-turn slated    

504 words
29 December 2005
Sheffield Star
SHEFST
English
(c) 2005 Johnston Publishing Limited    

A senior financial planning consultant from Sheffield has accused Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown of "throwing the baby out with the bathwater" when he changed the rules on Self Invested Personal Pensions to bar investment in homes.    

Until the Chancellor's abrupt change of heart, foreign holiday homes and buy-to-let properties, as well as personal residences, would have become eligible investments for a Self Invested Personal Pension (Sipp).    

All that changed when the Chancellor banned all homes from being used as Sipps in his pre-Budget report, earlier in December.    

Tony Decunha, from the Sheffield office of PKF Financial Planning, part of the accountancy and business consultancy group PKF, has made a blistering attack on what he describes as the Chancellor's "bombshell U-turn".    

Mr Decunha says many people were relying on discounts of up to 40 per cent from tax breaks to help fund a purchase.    

The Council of Mortgage Lenders estimated one in three deals after April was going to be Sipp-driven.    

Also, the threat of a £4 billion-a-year in lost tax revenue to the Treasury may have been too much for Gordon Brown to bear.    

"The dour man of the manse may have had fears that the original changes to Sipps could see an abuse of the rules with people buying holiday homes but his all embracing U-turn amounts to throwing the baby out with the bathwater.    

"Thousands of people have already moved money into a Sipp to buy a property and, in some cases, already bought the property 'off-plan' to move into the Sipp when the rules were due to change in April.    

"It was obvious from the outset that the changes to Sipps from April would create new demand for buy-to- let properties and second homes, thus inflating the value of house prices even higher."    

Mr Decunha says there are suggestions that the U-turn by Mr Brown will further damage the pensions industry which already has a poor image as a result of the collapse of several high-profile occupational pension schemes.    

He adds the Chancellor has also changed the rules to prevent artificially recycling tax-free lump sums as pension contributions.    

The original rules meant someone aged over 50 could make a pension contribution of say £10,000 and 'retire' immediately, withdrawing 25 per cent as a tax free lump sum.    

They would have received tax relief of up to 40 per cent on the original investment.    

This £2,500 could then immediately be reinvested in another pension scheme, again obtaining 40 per cent tax relief and 25 per cent of this could be withdrawn tax-free.    

There is no advantage under current rules, as in order to withdraw the 25 per cent tax free cash the pension scheme member has to also take a pension income which could be taxed at up to 40 per cent.    

Under proposed rules, the pension scheme member does not have to draw any income.

Tessa rollover money to seek cautious investment options tax reliefs

three groups are to customise tessa-only isas to attract assets due to mature    

HSBC, Bristol & West and the Woolwich are revamping their Tessa-only Isa (Toisa) product selections to attract hundreds of millions of pounds of assets due to mature from structured products next year.    

Providers are looking at guaranteed returns and income distribution for the ageing customer base due to roll over former Tessa (tax exempt savings account) money next year.    

Figures seen by Investment Week show HSBC alone is due to have around £250m maturing in the first half of next year from its HSBC Performance Plus Isa.    

Much of the money in these schemes has consistently rolled over in five-year terms since Tessas were first introduced in the 1990 to 1991 tax year.    

Groups are making extensive efforts to ensure New Year offerings meet the needs of increasingly elderly investors, some of whom have become sceptical about equity investments since the early Millennium bear market.    

Details provided to financial advisers show HSBC Investments is planning to offer savers a scheme where half the money goes into a product offering 50% of the growth in the FTSE 100, underwritten by HSBC Bank.    

The rest will be placed in what is effectively a savings account provided by HSBC Bank. Over a five-year term, this will provide 0.5% over Bank of England interest rates, or 1% over six years. This will provide the income the group thinks older savers require.    

Initial material given to advisers shows that Woolwich Plan Managers is hoping to give sceptical investors a minimum return of 124% of the money they put in or a percentage of any rise in the FTSE 100 index.    

But Bristol & West for its part, while currently offering products linked solely to the FTSE 100, is considering a new issue for March aimed at more adventurous investors that will link returns to a selection of overseas stock markets.    

Christopher Taylor, director of UK structured products distribution for HSBC Investments, said: "Two things are going to be particularly relevant. One is investor demographics, as the simple fact is that these investors are going to be 15 years older than when Tessas were first available. They were probably at or close to retirement age even then, and as such are very likely to be looking for income generation now.    

"Second, providers will need to empathise investor experience and sentiment.    

"Over five years, many investors are going to be sitting on a loss on various funds and products, which means while they may still appreciate the benefits of the growth potential that market exposed products can provide, they are likely to be more demanding. What may appeal are secure income streams or growth products with features such as early release of minimum returns."    

Tessas were launched in the 1990-1991 tax year with billions of pounds placed into the accounts, much of it just before the tax year.

Giving children a step onto the property ladder

A third of current 10-year-olds will not be able to buy a home when they reach 30. According to The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister there are not enough houses being built to meet demand and future generations will be priced out of the market.    

But the situation facing many of today's would-be first-time buyers is just as challenging.    

The ODPM says that nearly a quarter of first-time buyers now rely on gifts and loans from family to help them onto the ladder, against just 4% 20 years ago. As a result, lenders are introducing a range of innovative mortgages to help parents give children a leg-up.    

Ray Boulger at mortgage broker Charcol says: "Parents have to decide whether they make a capital investment or use their income to support their child. Both offer a wide range of options but carry different levels of risk.'"    

The home loan normally offered to parents and children is a family offset mortgage, where parents commit their savings to reduce the mortgage repayment.    

Offset mortgages combine a savings account with a loan and the two operate like a see-saw. If savings are reduced, the mortgage debt - and the repayments - rise. If more savings are added, the mortgage falls by an equivalent amount.    

For example, if a property is worth £200,000 and parents invest savings of £25,000, interest is charged on the difference - £175,000 but parents will forfeit interest payments on their savings.    

Yorkshire Building Society has just launched a family and friends offset deal across its range of mortgages, the best of which is priced at 4.64% fixed until the end of 2007.    

Another option for parents is to become a guarantor of their child's mortgage. This means they will be responsible for maintaining the mortgage if the child defaults. Abbey, Halifax , Cheltenham & Gloucester and the Co-op Bank all allow parents to be such guarantors    

This is a risky option as the lender could seek to repossess the parent's home if payments are missed and families interested in undertaking this loan should seek legal advice.    

Parents would also need to be high earners since they will be need to have enough cash to cover repayments on their child's mortgage, as well as their own.    

Boulger says: "Some lenders allow the parent just to cover the part of the loan the child cannot afford, but they are few and far between.'"    

One of the few is Bristol & West's First Start mortgage, which combines the parent's income after expenses with the child's. The bank will base its lending decision on either 2.75 times the joint income, or four times the highest salary plus the smaller.

MIKE THE MONEY Some optional extras are money in the bank - but you should avoid most of them like the plague

A restaurant makes its biggest profits by selling drinks. Property companies get rich via service charges. And the car      

salesman can make a killing by selling optional extras.      

You should avoid most of them. If a standard car isn't kitted out as you want it, find one that is. Just don't fall into the      

trap of ticking the boxes for toys and gizmometers that can easily double the price of the vehicle. And don't think you get      

that money back either. Just because you're daft enough to shell out twice as much as you originally planned for your fully      

loaded motor, don't assume that the person you sell it on to will see it the same way.      

A secondhand motor could prove difficult to get rid of if it's got the wrong sort of options. You might love that pink      

paint, but can you find a buyer who does? The same goes for the fattest wheels and tyres. I recently drove a new BMW      

6-series with a thoroughly offensive green interior. It will undoubtedly struggle as a used car unless admirers of vile      

avocado bathroom suites from the 1970s can somehow be traced (see James May, page 3). Fixed TV screens and DVDs installed in      

and around dashboards aren't a great idea either. They cost thousands when ordered as optional extras but add little to the      

vehicle when it's sold on.      

If you must have such technology, go for a cheap and cheerful twin-screen aftermarket system like the portable,      

easy-to-conceal Venturer I recently got from Halfords for a mere pounds 169. It transfers from car to car in seconds and      

plugs into a cigarette lighter socket.      

Manheim Auctions has been monitoring the effects that optional extras have on the hundreds of thousands of cars it handles.      

It confirms that bad options can simply "turn used car buyers off''. The right ones can be "a good investment and ensure a      

used car enjoys a quick sale''. Metallic paint is basically money in the bank, Manheim hints. It might cost you only a few      

hundred pounds when ordering your car new, but it could add pounds 1,000 or more to its second-hand value a few years      

later.      

Satellite navigation and leather seats are good long-term bets in large family cars and an even wiser investment in compact      

executive models. Luxury motors really must be ordered with automatic transmissions, because those with manual gearboxes are      

worth many thousands less to used car buyers in some cases, says Manheim.      

Apart from these factory-fitted "must haves'', regard almost all other pricey optional extras as superfluous. They just      

aren't worth wasting your money on. "There are certain options which will actually make your car worth less when you come to      

sell it'' is Manheim's final word.

Beware mortgage gimmicks Loans with a sting

BORROWERS should treat rewards attached to home loans as gimmicks, finance experts say.    

Lenders are offering petrol discounts, frequent flyer points and free accommodation to attract new borrowers in a softer housing market.    

Residential home loan approvals have fallen 9 per cent from their monthly national peak of 60,100 in October 2003, says Westpac spokesman Huw Mckay.    

Experts say home loan products should be judged on their merits and must be tailored to suit the borrower's needs, without regard to rewards.    

John Symond, of Aussie Home Loans, said switching lenders for a petrol discount or other rewards could leave borrowers thousands of dollars worse off.    

"They're gimmicks," he said. "Short-term gain could end up being long-term pain."    

Mr Symond said the rewards programs were examples of lenders reacting to stiffer competition.    

"Lenders are becoming concerned because the home loan pie is getting smaller and they fear losing market share," said Mr Symond, managing director of a company that has 18 lenders offering 1000 home loan products.    

"They're getting desperate and the inducements are about maintaining today's market share.    

"Today it's petrol, tomorrow it might be electrical goods. Anyway, the oil price is coming off."    

Mr Symond said borrowers should also be wary of other inducements, such as honeymoon rates. They offered a discount to the lender's variable rate for at least six months. But borrowers reverted to the higher variable rate -- which might be higher than their previous lender's rate -- once the honeymoon expired. Lenders locked borrowers in to standard variable rates for about three years after the honeymoon finished.    

"There are big exit fees on honeymoon rates. Changing loans can often prove expensive unless there is a clear case of saving money," Mr Symond said.    

He predicted interest rates would remain unchanged well into 2006 -- and could drop if the economy slowed.    

Nick Coates, of the Australian Consumers Association, said the reward programs "don't stack up".    

"The fuel reduction can be more than offset by higher fees and charges and the big one was exit fees," Mr Coates said. "Increasingly, reward points declined over time and the points system can be altered retrospectively."    

The Australian National Credit Union is offering borrowers a saving of 50c a litre on petrol for a year. The offer applies to loans of more than $100,000 before November 30. Its website claims motorists will save $2080 a year.    

The Greater Building Society offers a fuel saving of 20c a litre for a year. And its rewards points program involves free accommodation.    

The ANZ Bank offers 25,000 Qantas frequent flyer points for each $100,000 borrowed on a pro-rata basis at settlement.    

Wizard Home Loans has a honeymoon rate of 5.47 per cent for six months. The loan will revert to its standard variable rate of 6.97 per cent after the initial six months.

Priorities for engineer, back after eight years in UK

GLEN Hedges' short-term goals are well within his reach. High on the list of priorities is the purchase of his own home and a 4-wheel drive.    

Having returned from the UK earlier this year, Glen was concerned about the tax implications of transferring the cash from the sale of his home in the UK back to Australia. His fears were unfounded and Glen has now arranged the transfer of the money.    

Glen is also proceeding with the transfer of the relatively small amount of superannuation that he has in the UK into his Australian superannuation fund.    

There will be a small amount of contribution tax payable by the fund on the amount of growth in value between the time Glen left the UK to the date of transfer. This will be calculated by the super fund when it receives the funds.    

Once this has occurred, Glen will look for a super fund which uses ethical investment funds in its portfolio. This is in keeping with his strong views on environmental sustainability.    

For his short-term goals, Glen's best course of action is to use the cash he transfers from the UK to buy his 4WD and place a substantial deposit on a new home. His major focus should then be on paying off his mortgage.    

The big risk in Glen's life is the lack of insurance. He just doesn't have any.    

First and foremost, Glen needs to implement income protection insurance. There's a wide range of products available to him; but he needs to ensure there are certain features in the one he chooses. He needs to select a product that is guaranteed renewable and has a realistic waiting period.    

Such benefits as super contributions can also form part of the policy; and a maximum benefit period to the age of 65 would also be appropriate. Probably one of the most beneficial features is bedcare benefit, which triggers payment of the daily benefit amount if the insured is in hospital for more than 24 hours.    

Lump sum insurance includes trauma insurance, which is payable on the diagnosis of certain dread diseases such as melanoma and heart attack, or injuries such as severe burns or paraplegia. This type of insurance is useful to clear mortgage debt, provide a lump sum for home renovation, to accommodate a wheelchair perhaps, or simply to provide an emergency fund.    

Finally, Glen does not have a valid will or enduring power of attorney. With the number of assets involved, both of these areas should be attended to as a matter of urgency.    

Name: Glen Hedges.    

Age: 32.    

Occupation: Environmental engineer.    

Income: Contract basis -- full-time $55 per hour.    

Investments: UK cash at bank about $188,350, UK superannuation about $12,150, managed funds $13,000, Australian cash at bank $15,000,    

Australian superannuation $8500: total $237,500.    

Debts: Nil.    

Dependants: None.    

Strategy: Michael Crandon, CFP, MBA.

IBD'S 10 SECRETS TO SUCCESS Providing A Perfect Match

6 It was 1989, and the Berlin Wall had just been torn down. Carlos Garcia -- who'd started his maintenance-service firm two years earlier -- quickly spotted the peace dividend.      

By the time the Soviet Union had collapsed in 1991, Garcia had already restructured his business.      

His firm, Kira, launched in 1987 to provide a range of services to the Department of Energy. With the fall of Soviet communism four years later, Garcia targeted the Department of Defense as his primary client.      

Why? With the Soviet threat gone and America's armed forces downsized, the DOD couldn't afford to waste manpower on the maintenance of U.S. military bases. Those were exactly the types of services Garcia's firm provided.      

Market Ready      

"Though the DOD was outsourcing some (base maintenance work) at the time, I knew they'd start doing a lot more," Garcia told IBD.      

To grab that opportunity, he hired a retiring brigadier general "who'd been director of housing and facilities for the Army," Garcia recalled. "I told him, "Get us into the business.' "      

The general leveraged his connections, first getting Garcia work as a consultant, "to get our foot in the door," he recalled. "A year later, we went after the real work."      

Today, Garcia's Miami-based firm provides construction, renovation and maintenance services for a range of U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force bases.      

His firm covers everything from landscaping to food service. Revenue last year was $35 million, up from $20 million in 2003. Garcia says sales will hit $55 million in 2006.      

"Our backlog is $400 million -- that's work that we've won and will execute over the coming years" as multiyear contracts play out, he said.      

Due Diligence      

Meanwhile, Garcia is continually working to sign up new business. He beats rivals on bids in part by scouting new projects early -- a year or more before contracts are up for renewal. He scours forecasting databases and government portals, and tours contract sites that match his business model.      

"Just as important as spotting opportunities is identifying those we're not going to bid on," said Garcia, who was born in Cuba.      

With high-end job proposals costing as much as $200,000 each, care in project selection is critical. "We bid approximately one out of 30 opportunities that we look at," he said.      

Once bidding's under way, Garcia says he beats many competitors on value. "We look at the performance (of current contract holders) and ask ourselves if we can offer a better solution -- either more at the same price, or the same at a lower price," he said.      

Garcia is also adept at "contracting consolidation" -- participating in joint ventures with other contractors, said Joel Russell, deputy managing editor of Hispanic Business magazine. "In the industry, many such ventures don't work. Garcia makes them work. And that puts him on the leading edge," Russell told IBD.

Cash: Silver Savers: Grey matters: Market risks still hitting final salaries

IF YOU are a member of a 'final salary' or other defined benefit scheme, your investment risk has been removed and you need not worry about your future pension entitlement. True or false?      

As the members of some of the Rover pension schemes and many other workers know, the statement is false.      

The risks of stock market investments are still hitting members of these schemes - and those risks will become plainer in the next few years. In fact, the impact of those risks could even hit investors who have no pension scheme investments.      

So what is happening? By the end of this year - having twice been postponed - the pensions regulator is due to produce rules which will outline the approach trustees need to take when dealing with pension scheme deficits and other funding issues.      

It is likely that trustees will be required to be more cautious and that, in summary, will mean switching more of their assets from equities to bonds. Since occupational pension scheme assets now account for about pounds 700 billion, according to UBS Philips & Drew, a shift away from equities could see billions coming out of the stock market each year.      

If the money is reinvested in bonds, returns are likely to be lower, even if more predictable. That is clearly a problem for trustees and, perhaps, for members of schemes. While the new Pension Protection Fund exists to bail out members of failed defined benefit schemes which cannot meet their debts, the fund will only pay out to a limited extent and many people could end up with a smaller pension than they expected.      

But there is a second issue here. 'If big funds are coming out of equities, what does that do for the market itself?' asks Deborah Wilson of pension administrator MNPA. Could it be, she continues, that ordinary investors in equity-based individual savings accounts, other unit and investment trusts or direct shareholdings, could find prices depressed when so much selling is going on? She believes the process could take years to work through: 'It could be five years before the full effects are felt.'      

However, Brian Kilpatrick of the National Association of Pension Funds believes that the market will not be held down by this switch of assets out of shares. Pension funds own about a sixth of UK equities - and he believes the move out will be too slow to hurt prices. 'It would be a gradual process happening over a number of years,' he says.      

It is too early to tell who is right, but the regulator's slowness in getting out the regulations shows just how troublesome this issue is. A badly worded statement could have a very negative effect on stock markets. While the regulator is trying to reduce the number of schemes going bust with a large deficit, if the rules are too enthusiastically worded, a pronounced exit from equities will hurt us all.

Stocks Fall Amid Auto-Sector Woes, With Dow Off 53.55; Gold Price Shines

UNDER PRESSURE from Delphi's bankruptcy filing and continuing inflation fears, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell to its lowest finish since May, as gold rose to its highest New York close in nearly 18 years.

The Dow industrials retreated 53.55 points, or 0.5%, to 10238.76 and are down 5.1% for 2005. Yesterday's decline follows last week's 2.6% pullback in the Dow, its third-sharpest weekly decline of the year.

Gold rose 40 cents to $475.10 an ounce, the highest since January 1988.

The Standard &Poor's 500-stock index hit a five-month low, and the Nasdaq Composite Index hit a three-month low. The bond market and some related futures markets were closed for Columbus Day.

The immediate catalyst for the downturn was the filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection over the weekend by Delphi, General Motors' former subsidiary and major supplier, together with a spate of warnings about disappointing results to come from companies such as Northrop Grumman, Unisys and Xilinx.

Standard &Poor's cut GM's debt rating, pushing it further into junk territory. Analysts worried Delphi's bankruptcy filing could worsen GM's pension burden. GM stock fell 9.9%.

"Take a look at how many folks and how many industries are touched by auto. You can see how the economy in general and many individuals could suffer from that," said Todd Clark, director of stock trading at San Francisco brokerage and money-management firm Nollenberger Capital Partners.

More broadly, investors are worried that high energy and commodity prices will hold down profits and consumer spending and push interest rates higher, stifling the economy.

After the closing bell, investors received good news when Alcoa, the first component of the Dow industrials to announce quarterly profits, released better-than-expected results. The stock rose 53 cents, or 2.3%, to $23.19 in after-hours trading.

During regular hours, the S&P 500 fell 0.72%, or 8.57 points, to 1187.33, down 2% this year. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.55%, or 11.43 points, to 2078.92, down 4.4% for 2005.

Outside the U.S., stocks declined in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index fell 0.43%, or 0.94 point, to 219.98. Excluding the U.S., the index fell 0.12%, or 0.23 point, to 184.11.

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks retreated. On the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.6 billion shares traded, 940 stocks rose and 2,305 fell.

The bond market was closed. The 10-year Treasury note's yield finished on Friday at 4.358% ahead of yesterday's Columbus Day holiday for the market.

The dollar strengthened. Late in New York, the currency traded at 114.12 yen, up from 113.77, while the euro fell against the dollar to $1.2068 from $1.2125.

Lenders find security in mortgage bond plan: 'CMHC finally hit the nail on the head'

Mortgage-backed securities and related mortgage bonds have been a valuable source of cheap financing for lenders, and they give financial institutions the ability to fund growing mortgage portfolios.

With about $100-billion in mortgage-backed securities outstanding, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) has been key to getting investors into this product. Under its Canadian Mortgage Bond Program, established in 2001, financial institutions originate mortgages, pool them together and sell them as packages in the form of mortgage-backed securities to an entity called Canadian Housing Trust.

The trust -- advised by CMHC -- issues bonds that pay interest similar to Government of Canada bonds, using the cash flow from the mortgage-backed securities to make the payments. "It's a huge program that has been very successful," says Boris Kogut, vice-president of securitization at Bank of Montreal. "CMHC finally hit the nail on the head with mortgage securitization."

The appetite for Canada Mortgage Bonds has been significant: $19.3-billion of them were issued in 2003 and $17.25-billion in 2004. This year, they will hit between $15-billion and $20-billion.

"Our participation allows for low-cost access of mortgage funds," says Les Badzioch, acting director of securitization operations at CMHC, "because ... financial institutions are able to get mortgage funding at rates close to Government of Canada credit."

Mr. Kogut says that more than 10% of Canada's entire mortgage market has been securitized through the Canada Mortgage Bond Program.

Before 2001, mortgage-backed securities were sold directly into the market. Since then, Canada Mortgage Bonds have become the dominant instrument -- of about $100-billion in mortgage-backed securities outstanding, $67.6-billion were funded through the bond program.

"You're seeing Canada Mortgage Bonds really taking off," Mr. Badzioch says. "Mortgage-backed securities are still created, but they're not being issued in large volumes into the market any more. They're mainly being issued to the Canada Housing Trust."

The underlying mortgages are insured either by private insurance companies or CMHC, which also issues a timely-payment guarantee.

Because banks can raise money cheaply through securitization, they can offer better mortgage rates to homebuyers, Mr. Kogut says. "That's helped, to some extent, drive the housing boom and lower the mortgage financing costs."

Stephen Goltz, associate director at Standard & Poor's in Toronto, says mortgage-backed securities provide an off-balance-sheet source of financing to lenders, noting that while "there are various ways that these companies could fund the growth of their mortgage portfolios," securitization is attractive because of its lower cost base.

Beja Rodeck, a spokeswoman for Royal Bank of Canada, agrees that, while low interest rates are the "real driving force in sustaining the housing boom," mortgage securitization and the Canada Mortgage Bond Program reduce the bank's funding costs.

Ontario grants stay of execution for labour-sponsored funds: Province won't fully eliminate tax credit for another six years

The death of the Ontario tax credit on much-maligned labour-sponsored investment funds will be drawn out over six years under proposals announced yesterday.    

Finance Minister Greg Sorbara said that the tax credit will not be fully eliminated until the end of the 2010 tax year. "We're committed to an orderly wind-down, and believe that this schedule will help accomplish that goal," he said.    

Jack Mintz, president and chief executive of the C.D. Howe Institute, an economic think-tank, said a two-year period would actually be more appropriate, "but that might be too close to the next election."    

Mr. Mintz said he supports Ontario's decision to get rid of the tax credit, which has so far hidden the reality of weak returns to investors from most LSIFs. However, he said the current timetable will just leave a headache for the next provincial government, which will have to deal with cleaning up what's left of the controversial investment vehicles.    

Mr. Sorbara initially announced he was putting an end to the 15% tax credit on LSIFs in August. The credit was introduced about 15 years ago to encourage funding for Ontario's venture capital sector.    

There are now 46 registered labour-sponsored funds in the province managing about $3-billion in assets.    

Although the tax credit made the funds popular with some investors, the venture capital landscape in the province is now very different and many fund managers can no longer find enough projects to invest all the funds at their disposal, Mr. Mintz said.    

The sector has also come under fire after a series of scandals at particular funds, such as the Crocus Investment Fund in Manitoba, which is facing a lawsuit from its own shareholders.    

Yesterday's announcement came after three weeks of consultation with the fund management and venture capital industry. The six-year plan resulting from that consultation will include no change to the tax credit until the 2009 tax year, when the credit will be reduced to 10%. It will then be cut to 5% the following year and will be fully eliminated thereafter. Federal tax credits will still be available to investors.    

That plan was welcomed by Rick Nathan, president of the Canadian Venture Capital Association. He said the plan removes "a cloud of uncertainty" that had hung over the venture capital market since the initial decision to cut the provincial credit.    

David Ferguson, managing general partner at VenGrowth Private Equity Partners Inc., supports the six-year timetable. He said it was "absolutely naive" to say the tax credit should be phased out in just two years because LSIFs represent 35% of Ontario's venture capital funds.

Treasury Adds Color, Security In New $10 Bill

WASHINGTON -- The color of money is getting more varied. A newly designed $10 bill was unveiled yesterday featuring splashes of orange, yellow and red to go with the traditional green.

The $10 bill is the third denomination to be jazzed up with colors as part of the government's effort to thwart counterfeiters and the ever-more-sophisticated devices at their disposal.

"Thanks to the changes we've made in currency design, thanks to aggressive law enforcement led by the U.S. Secret Service and thanks to an informed public, we've been able to stay ahead of the counterfeiters," Treasury Secretary John Snow said during the unveiling ceremony on Ellis Island in New York Harbor.

The location was selected to highlight one of the new features of the bill -- a red image of the Statue of Liberty's torch on the left side of the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the Treasury.

The $10 makeover followed changes to the $20 bill in 2003 and the $50 bill in 2004.

Don't look for the more colorful $10 to show up at your local ATM right away. The bills won't go into circulation until early next year. But the government was eager to publicize the new design so that people can prepare for the changes.

The $10 redesign is similar to the changes made to the $20 and the $50, but the colors are different because each denomination is being given its own set of colors to make finding the right bill in your wallet easier.

The orange, yellow and red colors for the $10 bill are found on the red torch on Hamilton's left and the phrase "We the people" on Hamilton's right. The background is a subtle shade of orange, and there are small yellow 10s surrounding the torch.

Other security features, some of which were first introduced in the 1990s during an earlier makeover, include a plastic security thread woven into the note that repeats "USA Ten" in tiny print. There also is a watermark that can be seen when the bill is held up to the light and color-shifting ink that makes the numeral "10" in the lower right-hand corner on the face of the bill change color from copper to green when the bill is tilted.

For the $20, the additional colors were blue, peach and a different shade of green while the $50 bill featured the added colors of blue and red.

Alexander Hamilton remains on the face of the bill but he is outside of his old portrait frame with more of his shoulders showing. The other side of the bill still features the U.S. Treasury building in Washington.

The next bill to get the color treatment will be the $100 bill, which is expected to be redesigned in 2007.

At present, there are no plans to add color to the $1, $2 or $5 bills.

Up to the beginning of this year all my experience was of working in large and well known investment management companies. There is no such thing as a problem free life but one problem that I did not have was explaining whom I represented.    

Now I am with a smaller firm who launched their first multi-manager funds in December 2004. My job has not really changed - I still promote OEICs to the IFA market. We are multi-manager specialists, a boutique that only works in this area and does not try to be all things to all men. The multi-manager market has exploded and IFAs have been big buyers for their clients.    

I assumed that I would be spending most of my time explaining who we are and why IFAs should use us. Imagine my surprise when, not only were IFAs more than happy to hear all about us and how we operate, but to also discover that their real concerns were about service.    

As most of the IFAs that I am calling on have known me from my previous roles I had an easy time making appointments with them. It was good that many of them knew our head of fund of funds and his investment management style. However, I was still taken aback to find them moving on so rapidly to service support levels.    

While many large and well known companies do a good job in some respects, in others they are inflexible. By concentrating their service on larger IFAs - particularly in the investment markets - they ignore or at least do not adequately service the average IFA.    

Working for a small company has given me a different perspective on a number of facets of the business. Being involved in so much more of the process gives you an in depth understanding of what can and cannot be done. This can range from the design and content of a fact sheet, to administrative ways to make an IFA's work simpler.    

This meant I could go out and talk to IFAs, ask what they thought and have this taken into consideration. At bigger companies I would have been presented with a fait-a-complet by some department or other. As we are smaller we are more flexible, we can be less restrictive and are more able to provide the service needed by IFAs.    

It is particularly interesting that a number of larger companies have pulled further away from this face to face service level and are expecting IFAs to deal with a phone in service desk. Companies have tried this before and have failed, and I do not think that it will be any different this time.    

Our industry has always been a people industry and it always will be. There is a place in it for smaller business which are different and prepared to offer a level of service that many larger groups are no longer prepared to offer.

At the same time, some bases are healthier than others, and should give investors greater confidence that they are jumping in at the proper buy point.    

Sometimes a base may appear sound, only to contain multiple flaws. When a stock breaks out from that faulty base, it may quickly pull back, confounding those who thought they had spotted a winner.    

Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, which sells men's suits, ties and other apparel, broke out three times between February 2004 and April 2005. Lending credence to the saying "the third time's the charm," the first two moves didn't go far before the stock retreated.    

The February 2004 breakout (1) followed a four-month, cup-shaped base that declined 45% from top to bottom (2). You usually want to find a base that falls no more than 2 1/2 times as much as the market. Since the market fared well in 2003 and only started falling in January 2004, the 45% correction was steeper than you'd like to see. The greater the drop, the harder a stock has to fight to retake its optimal buy point.    

After clearing its buy point set in early October 2003, the stock climbed just 13% before retreating into a base-on-base. By mid-April 2004, it had undercut its previous buy point (3). Investors who were following their sell rules would have exited as the stock dropped 7% below its original buy level.    

The stock then attempted another rally. By September 2004 it had shaped the right side of the base and was forming a handle. It broke out in late October, but in below-average weekly volume (4). The stock quickly pulled back in heavy volume the following week (5).    

Institutional investors weren't yet ready to support the stock. On the plus side, that same week the Nasdaq rose 3% in rapid turnover.    

As IBD often notes, strong sales and profit growth often drive stock price growth. In early January '05, the firm said same-store sales rose 16.2% in December. It also boosted its full-year earnings estimate.    

After forming a fresh base for several months, Jos. A. Bank broke out again in April (6), after an upbeat quarterly earnings report. The firm beat analysts' views by 4 cents and boosted its yearly profit outlook.    

Though much attention was focused on top-performing teen-focused clothing retailers like Urban Outfitters and American Eagle Outfitters, menswear was showing its own strength, as office workers began dressing up again.    

The April 2005 breakout came as the stock cleared its 31.59 buy point. This time, the breakout held. The stock ran up 47% to a July 25 high of 46.60 (7). It sliced its 10-week during the market's August pullback, but has since bounced back.

Economics    

T HE government is today set to boast just how well it has done in getting people to save money.    

Figures are to be released which show almost 600,000 Australians have made superannuation co-contribution payments since the scheme was put in place last year.    

Well done, Assistant Federal Treasurer Mal Brough will say, well done, indeed.    

The government is tackling the problem of under-savings.    

And to some extent this is true. However, the current savings level of Australians, particularly among young people is poor.    

The population does not save nearly enough and overall is dramatically underprepared for retirement.    

It's easy to see why from the view point of a young person. Retirement is years away.    

In the meantime, there's a mortgage, a spanky new car with a not-so-spanky accompanying loan, children, career building and all kinds of other more pressing needs for the funds at hand.    

It's a poor situation and one which makes it hard to grandstand.    

The new co-contribution figures obtained by YourMoney show retirement savings have been boosted by $309 million. However, the superannuation savings gap has been estimated to be in the range of almost $600 billion.    

Note to government: must cast co-contribution line further out to help make up shortfall.    

Interestingly though, women are taking up the government's generous payment of $1.50 for every extra $1 contributed at a much faster rate then males.    

Almost 63 per cent of the extra payments were made by females with the average worth about $570.    

Blokes, on the other hand, are a little more shabby.    

Their level of contributing was lower and worth less -- about $495.    

The government will also herald that more than 47 per cent of beneficiaries of the co-contribution scheme were between the ages of 46 and 64.    

But that age group is already well aware of its looming retirement. The problem is getting young people saving.    

The national accounts released last week for the June quarter highlighted the on-going problem for many young people and the population in general and that is people consume more than they earn.    

Economists say this could potentially create havoc for the overall economy -- crazy consumers spending too much, taking on too much debt -- it could all funnel into a very nasty fiscal situation.    

But, as one economist said, while the rest of the world remained keen to finance Australia's growing capital account deficit, the situation should remain under control.    

Bill Evans, Westpac's chief economist, has an interesting take on whether Australians are consuming too much.    

At the moment, he says, yes we are but he also believes the "rampant consumer" that the economy has seen is also taking a `cold shower.'    

Big ticket purchases are being put off and budgets re-assessed to cover the increases in the cost of fuel. Which again, dents the desire and need to save.

Found at last: loads of full wallets SAVINGS.

In the world of personal finance, it is just one disaster after another. Every day comes a new survey with headache-inducing facts and figures about the dire state of the British wallet: we're spending too much, we're not saving enough, our pensions are a mess and we're drowning in credit card debt.

Finally this week two studies straight from the good news department. The personal finances of the majority of the UK public, it seems, are not all that bad.

According to a study by the Association of Payment Clearing Services, the trade body governing electronic payments, most credit card holders are reining in their spending and using their plastic sensibly.

The study says credit card spending grew by 6.9 per cent to Pounds 106bn in 2004, the slowest growth rate in more than 10 years. At the end of 2004, 93 per cent of the year's spending on cards had been repaid, which was similar to the previous year but up from 88 per cent in 2002. Recent figures from the Bank of England show repayments had risen to almost 97 per cent in the year to July.

The study also shows that total debt outstanding on credit cards began to fall in the first half of this year. Consumer debt on cards rose by 14.8 per cent in 2004 to Pounds 56.4bn, but by the end of July was down to Pounds 55.9bn.

Perhaps the best news of all is that 73 per cent of cardholders paid off their balance in full each month, meaning no interest payments for the card issuers, while just 6 per cent of people paid the minimum.

"The overwhelming majority of consumers borrows responsibly and deals with debt responsibly," said Paul Rodford, head of card payments at Apacs.

Another survey this week shows that the British public is starting to save more often and more regularly. According to National Savings and Investments, the government-backed agency, 55 per cent of the population saved regularly over the past three months, an increase of 7 per cent from the previous quarter. Those who saved managed to salt away an average of Pounds 160 a month.

According to the study, based on telephone interviews with nearly 6,000 adults, the best savers are young, single and work full-time - those traditionally thought to be reckless and spendthrift. Over the past three months, the under-25 age group saved 10.11 per cent of monthly income - the highest average proportion of income; followed by those aged 25 to 34, saving 7.17 per cent.

There are however always black linings to even the fluffiest fair-weather clouds and both these studies spotted some "worrying" trends. Personal credit card debt is increasing as a proportion over their overall debt and young women are among the worst savers, with one in eight single women holding no savings at all.

Australia 2004-05 Minerals, Energy Exports A$67.4B; +29%

CANBERRA (Dow Jones)--The value of Australian exports of mineral and energy products rose 29% to a record A$67.35 billion last fiscal year ended June 30 from the previous year, the government's Australian Bureau of Agricultural & Resource Economics, or Abare, reported Wednesday.    

"The strong performance reflects higher export prices across almost 80% of all minerals and energy commodities exported, along with increased export volumes for over two-thirds of all minerals and energy commodities exported," Brian Fisher, Abare's executive director, said in a statement.    

Exports in the 2004-05 fourth quarter of A$19.64 billion were up 24% from the previous quarter and were 37% higher on year, Abare reported.    

Major commodities to record strong increases in export values last fiscal year included coal and iron ore, it said.    

"Each of these commodities revealed increases in both export prices and volumes, particularly in the June quarter, followed by substantial increases in contract prices from Asian steel mills and electricity generation plants," Fisher said. [ 07-09-05 0042GMT ]    

The value of coking coal exports last fiscal year surged 65% to A$10.73 billion while the volume of exports rose only 12% to 124.87 million metric tons, Abare reported in its quarterly Australian Mineral Statistics publication.    

The value of steaming coal exports last fiscal year jumped 45% to A$6.34 billion despite the volume of exports slipping 0.3% to 106.39 million tons, the government's chief commodities forecaster said.    

The value of iron ore and pellets exports last fiscal year rose 55% to A$8.09 billion, in part helped by the volume of exports expanding 14% to 228.25 million tons, it said.    

The value of liquefied natural gas exports last fiscal year gained 47% to A$3.20 billion as the volume of LNG exports expanded 35% to 10.69 million tons, Abare reported.    

Large increases in the value of exports were also recorded last fiscal year for copper, lead, nickel, crude oil, silver and uranium, it said.    

An index of the value of total mineral resources export unit returns surged 29% to 173.2 last fiscal year and rose 20% in the fourth quarter of last fiscal year from the third quarter, Abare said.    

An index of the value of metals and other minerals export unit returns jumped 19% to 150.1 last fiscal year and rose 15% in the fourth quarter, Abare said.    

An index of the value of energy minerals export unit returns jumped 43% to 208.8 last fiscal year and rose 27% in the fourth quarter, it said.    

"These increases in 2004-05 reflect significantly higher world prices for most commodities compared with a year ago," Fisher said.    

An index of the volume of Australian mine production rose 5.4% last fiscal year, Abare reported.

Norwich Union raises commission on pensions as charge cap lifts

Norwich Union is raising the commission rates on some of its pension products as of 18 July. It is also increasing the charges cap on stakeholder products from 1% to 1.5% towards the end of the year.    

'We have carried out a review of both our pricing and commission and as a result will be increasing our commission rates,' said Iain Oliver, head of pensions at Norwich Union.    

'Initially we are maintaining our prices on the modified stakeholder pension at or below the 1% annual management charge and expect to increase this to the new stakeholder cap of 1.5% towards the end of the year.' With a 1.5% cap on charges, Norwich Union will have to absorb the costs of paying higher commission to intermediaries.    

'The proposed removal of the RU64 rule will provide greater access to personal pensions and we remain committed to providing products that give the opportunity for full advice through a transparent charging structure, Oliver said. RU64 is the rule which capped charges on stakeholder pensions to a maximum of 1% per annum.    

But IFAs point out that the higher commission will only be paid on Norwich Union's in-house pension products invested in Norwich Union funds. Like many life companies, NU offers a range of funds which it manages for other providers and commission will remain the same on these, creating a bias in favour of NU's home grown products.    

The changes mean that commission on full advice for lump sum investments in Individual Your Pension Select will rise from a maximum of 5.5% to a maximum of 6.2%.    

Commission on Stakeholder Individual Your Pension lump sum investments goes up from 2.5% plus uplift to 5.04% plus uplift. On the regular premium pensions commission will be increased from 10% of Lautro commission plus uplift to 40% of Lautro commission plus uplift.    

Commission is a vexed subject in the industry as there are many who believe, with justification, that it distorts advice. The Office of Fair Trading and the Financial Services Authority backed away from banning commission for IFAs and requiring them to charge fees like other professionals such as accountants, solicitors and architects. Such a move would have ensured that clients receive genuinely impartial advice.    

Depolarisation has muddied the waters too with consumers no longer easily able to distinguish between an IFA who is genuinely independent, and multi-tied agents who can sell the products of a selected 'panel' of providers.    

Competition to get on the recommended panels of big distributors like the high street banks is likely to result in a commission war as product providers jockey for position on the list.    

None of which augurs well for the consumer and increases the danger that the customer will be sold a product which earns the bank, or other distributor, the highest commission, rather than the product which is genuinely the most suitable or likely to be a good performer.

To Track House Bubble, Find Fault Line

For the past five years or so, would-be homebuyers have been asking themselves the same questions: When and where will home prices finally come down?

It isn't possible to answer those questions with any certainty. Studies have shown the direction of home prices to be closely correlated with economic fundamentals such as employment and population growth, and forecasting such trends is complex.

However, it is a little easier to figure out in which places homeowners are the most stretched financially -- and where, as a result, they could be in greater distress should prices fall.

That is most likely to happen in places where there are large gaps between home-price appreciation and income growth and a high percentage of adjustable rate mortgages as a share of new purchase loans -- in particular a high concentration of interest-only and option ARM loans. With their lower initial payments, these loans allow buyers to purchase homes that they often wouldn't be able to afford with a traditional fixed-rate long-term mortgage.

California appears to top the list of locations where homebuyers are the most stressed. Other potential trouble spots include Nevada, Florida, Washington and Rhode Island.

In the Golden State, annual home prices climbed 22% in 2004, while personal income grew at a pace of 4.8%, creating a 17.4 percentage-point gap between home price growth and income growth. Meanwhile, the percentage of new purchase loans that were adjustable rate was 58%, the highest of any state in 2004, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board.

In Nevada, home prices rose 28% in 2004, compared with income growth of 4.7%, resulting in a 23.6 percentage point gap. The ARM share of new loans in Nevada for 2004 was 46%.

Washington's gap between home price and income growth in 2004 was 13.6 percentage points, and the ARM share of purchase loans was 52%.

The massive gains in house prices in the past three years have outstripped improvement in economic fundamentals that normally help determine the direction of home prices, such as personal income, according to a recent study by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

"If this decline in affordability continues, it might eventually weigh on home sales and price appreciation as first-time buyers are priced out of the market," the FDIC report said.

But home prices show few signs of slowing, in part because borrowers are willing to sign up for risky mortgages.

Studies of housing boom-and-bust cycles have shown that house prices don't automatically have to go down after a period of rising rapidly. In fact, housing busts are relatively rare, the FDIC study shows, with a more typical boom followed by a period of price stagnation that lasts until incomes catch up with home prices.

The unknown factor in this current housing cycle is the effect that newer mortgage products could have on borrowers and, ultimately, on home prices.

How to get top dollar for your house

THE heat may have gone out of the property market but there's no reason why you can't sell your house for top dollar.      

EPS Property Search buyers agent and author of Insiders Guide to Buying Real Estate Patrick Bright believes there are really only two reasons a property doesn't sell: either no one knows it's for sale or the asking price is too far off the mark.      

In a soft market, Mr Bright says these two factors are critical to get right.      

A soft property market exists because there is an oversupply of stock (more people selling than buying), because buyers lack motivation or urgency or because buyers are confused about the state of the market.      

If you can't wait for the market to firm up, Mr Bright says the trick is to stand out from the crowd of sellers who are trying to gain the interest of a reduced number of often indecisive buyers.      

Although auctions are commonly used in a hot housing market, Mr Bright says this sales method can also be useful in a softer market -- it may be the best way to draw prompt attention to a house which is unique or has something special about it.      

Auction clearance rates are down, however, and many sellers are not comfortable with the process. If you choose to put it up for sale instead, Mr Bright reminds sellers to be spot on with the price tag.      

"In a soft market accurate pricing is critical," he says. "In a booming market you could put a property worth $900,000 (say) on the market for $950,000 because it wouldn't take that long for someone to throw an offer at you somewhere in the middle. "However in a soft market, assuming today's real market value for your property is $900,000 and you're asking $950,000 for your property (thinking you're leaving some room for negotiation) then you could miss gaining the interest of cashed-up buyers."      

In this situation, Mr Bright advises advertising the property for no more than $910,000.      

"If you feel that the market in your local area has the potential to fall further before it plateaus I would advertise it at $899,000 and take an offer that is $890,000 plus."      

Mr Bright says the seller is better off taking a $5000 or $10,000 loss now rather than letting the property go stale on the market and having to drop the price later to attract interest.      

"I have seen dozens of vendors make this mistake over the past 18 months," he says. "If you have to sell in a soft market and sell promptly make sure you adopt a selling strategy accordingly and that you price it right."      

If a good offer comes in early, Mr Bright advises against making the mistake of being greedy and expecting higher offers.

If everyone saved like Jeffrey Cupo, "we'd balance the trade deficit in about six months," says Mark Bass, a financial planner at Pennington Bass and Associates in Lubbock, Texas.    

Cupo has also done a good job diversifying among large-, midsize and small-company stock funds, as well as actively managed and index funds, Bass says. He should hold on to those funds and continue contributing to this Thrift Savings Plan and his Roth IRA, Bass says.    

But Cupo should consider shifting some of the money in his bank and money market accounts into his investment portfolio. "For someone his age and as little as he spends, that's more than he needs to keep in reserve," Bass says. Cupo could invest up to half his reserve funds and still have enough for emergencies.    

Bass recommends Cupo invest $60,000 of savings in funds that would diversify his portfolio. How Cupo could accomplish that goal:    

*Invest $30,000 in a diversified fund that invests in international stocks. Bass recommends Templeton Growth, which invests in U.S. and foreign stocks and has consistently outperformed its benchmark index. The fund's overseas investments will benefit if the U.S. dollar continues to decline, Bass says.    

*Invest $10,000 in a fund that invests in companies involved in oil and gas production, such as T. Rowe Price New Era, Bass says. Continued upward pressure on oil and gas prices bodes well for this sector, he says.    

*Invest $10,000 in a commodity-based fund. Bass recommends Oppenheimer Real Asset, which invests in futures contracts in energy and agriculture. While these assets can fluctuate greatly in value, this fund could actually reduce volatility in Cupo's portfolio because it moves in a different direction than the stock market, Bass says.    

*Invest $10,000 in a real estate fund. Bass recommends Franklin Real Estate, which invests in a broad range of publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Real estate securities also tend to move opposite of stocks, so this fund would reduce risk in Cupo's portfolio.    

Cupo believes he can save an additional $2,000 a month, so Bass recommends he gradually increase his holdings in the four new funds.    

Bass says Cupo should buy a long-term disability insurance policy. He has short-term disability insurance, but that doesn't protect him from a permanent disability from an illness or accident, Bass says. "Disability is an economic death, so he needs to protect against it."    

Cupo says he likes the idea of adding real estate, international stocks and commodities to his portfolio and has started researching funds in those sectors. But he's not ready to take $60,000 out of his emergency account. Instead, he plans to invest $30,000 in his retirement savings. In a year or two, he may add more.    

"I can't predict the future," he says. "I want to have something to fall back on."

Don't bank on filling pension black hole by moving house

IF you are thinking of selling your house and downsizing to make up a pension shortfall, you might not make as much as you'd hoped.

And there are some stark statistics which could well cause a rethink.

Unless you own property in London or the South-east of England the options are severely limited.

Despite the relatively low cost of moving, for most Scots in the average home, the only part of Britain where they can retire and still pocket a small nest egg is Northern Ireland.

When homeowners north of the Border move, they pay out less than anybody else in Britain on solicitor's fees, stamp duty and other removal costs, according to latest figures.

The average UK house move costs £6,200, but we save £2,000, spending just £4,200, but Londoners have to open their wallets very wide to pay a thumping £13,500.

House prices elsewhere in Britain average around £162,000, but in Scotland that value is just £116,000, according to Datamonitor in conjunction with insurance giants Prudential.

But most Scots do not pay stamp duty because the average price falls below the new £120,000 threshold.

Only people who live in a detached property or who own a home in London and the South-east are likely to have £50,000 after moving to a smaller property. Many could even find themselves out of pocket.

Someone moving from London to a similar-size property in a less expensive region would be able to free up £99,000. This figure almost doubled to £188,931 if they relocated to Northern Ireland.

A homeowner in the South-east could make at least £21,000 if they moved to another region other than London. This rises to nearly £90,000 if they go to Northern Ireland or just £77,000 if they come to Scotland.

The group estimates that moving from a semi-detached house to a terrace house would release an average of just £22,000 in equity across all regions, around a quarter of which would be eaten up by moving costs.

In order to release a large amount of money, people would have to move from a detached home to a terrace house, which would release an average of £111,747. Moving to a flat would unlock about £112,478.

Ali Crossley, director of Prudential's Lifetime Mortgages, said: "With over a million pensioners planning to move home for financial reasons, this report makes for a sober read.

"The long-held belief that downsizing is a way to plug the pension gap is only true for a minority of people, who live in detached houses or London and the South-east. Not only is it practically impossible for people in some regions to downsize to release equity, the large cost of moving home will eat into their profits. They may not end up with as much cash as they expected."

Triumph of the value managers

SMART FUNDS

A five-year performance comparison shows value managers have beaten the rest of the funds.

There are many different ways of measuring the strength of fund managers: returns, assets and risk, to name but a few. One theme that often comes up is the question of style and what that comes down to is the matter of value versus growth.

Value managers are those who buy stocks that appear to be undervalued in the belief that they will turn around and reflect their true value.

Growth involves buying stocks that you think will go up even if they're fairly or overvalued now.

There are various in-between styles growth at a reasonable price, neutral, core but most mainstream styles fall somewhere on a spectrum between these two poles.

The two years of soaring markets from March 2003 to March 2005 were ideal for a growth manager in that most things went up and continued to do so long after value managers could no longer see anything that warranted buying. So it's interesting to note that when prominent research group Morningstar last week printed a study of 45 Australian large-cap share fund managers, most of the top-ranked ones were value managers, and the bottom-ranked ones were growth.

Specifically, five of the 45 managers deserved the "highly recommended" ranking. They are BGI, GMO, Investors Mutual, Perennial Value and Perpetual Investments. All of them bar BGI (which Morningstar calls a "blend" style) are value investors.

The lowest grade Morningstar gave to any manager was "hold", which it conferred on Axa, HSBC, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch. All but HSBC are growth-styled managers.

Why does value win? Well, partly because Morningstar isn't just evaluating the past two years; it's looking back over the past five, and that includes a bear market.

"In terms of capital preservation, value managers fared much better at protecting investors' capital in falling markets," says Morningstar.

"On average, this group produced a 2.17 per cent return in 2002, compared with a minus 14.68 per cent average return from growth managers."

Morningstar sees two other reasons. First, value stocks outperformed growth stocks. Specifically, after the tech stock bubble burst in March 2000, investors shifted to defensive stocks which had been left undervalued as the herd piled into technology stocks. As a result, prices of defensive stocks rose and defensive stocks were where value-styled investors had put their money.

Secondly, smaller-cap stocks have done better than large-cap stocks in four of the past five years and value managers tend to have a higher exposure to mid-caps.

Nevertheless, Morningstar adds a caution. "While style and size factors have helped value-style managers deliver competitive returns, the free ride that value has enjoyed appears to be over." Morningstar thinks that in a future choppy market, returns are going to come down to good stock selection no matter what the style of the manager.

TAXATION OF INVESTMENTS New saving rules  hang on to your piggy-bank

May 20, 2005    

It's debatable whether the balance is right  in encouraging superannuation savings    

The new KiwiSaver scheme effectively makes a superannuation fund available to all employees, with contributions being managed through the tax system.    

The government will make a modest upfront contribution of $1000 to every new saver. Savers will be able to access the funds only for retirement, to buy a first home or in cases of emigration or hardship.    

The challenge is to make sure that businesses are not unduly burdened with compliance requirements.    

Also, it is debatable whether the use of the PAYE system to channel the savings will work well. While Dr Cullen correctly notes that much of the administration cost will be borne by Inland Revenue, there remain new costs imposed on businesses in gearing up for and managing the KiwiSaver process.    

However, the government intends to subsidise the fees charged by the private providers of KiwiSaver products.    

Dr Cullen's major tax problem is ironing out the wrinkles in the tax system. These include savings taxed differently depending on whether a saver invests directly into, for example, shares or whether the saver invests through a managed fund such as a unit trust, which itself invests into shares. The managed fund pays tax on its capital gains; most individual investors do not.    

There are further wrinkles because the nature of the managed fund can impact on the tax payable; the top marginal tax rate of 39c does not apply to payments from superannuation funds, whereas it can apply to savings made through unit trusts. This situation is exacerbated by the increasing number of investors who have redirected their savings through overseas investment vehicles. Until recently they have paid little or no New Zealand tax as a result.    

It is no real surprise that Dr Cullen has preferred the more general consensus. That is, savings vehicles and superannuation funds based in New Zealand should not be taxed in their own right but should be regarded as a "flow through" and the income should be attributed to investors.    

The effective capital gains tax on portfolio share investments should go. The most controversial aspect could become the taxation of foreign investments. The proposals to remove the "grey list" exemption mean that managed funds will be subject to an unrealised capital gains tax on all offshore portfolio share investments.    

Clearly there are difficulties in applying this approach to individuals and other investors potentially complex regime has been signalled. All the available options present difficulties and trade-offs for the government and for investors.    

Fund managers are likely to welcome one change. That is the removal of the distortion arising from the taxation investments made by individuals against those made through a managed fund. A distinction between the way domestic and overseas shares will be taxed is one of the options being considered by the government. This may well have wider ramifications on portfolio allocation decisions.

Aust govt to abolish superannuation surcharge

BUDGET05 By Tim Smith    

CANBERRA, May 10 AAP - The Australian government will abolish the superannuation surcharge for any contributions made or received from July 1, 2005.    

"We have previously tried to reduce this surcharge but the Labor Party blocked it, so tonight I announce the complete abolition of the surcharge from contributions and termination payments made or received from July 1, 2005," Treasurer Peter Costello said.    

The decision will cost $2.5 billion over the next four years.    

At the same time the government said it would establish a Future Fund to meet unfunded superannuation liabilities, which currently stand at $91 billion and are expected to grow to around $140 billion by 2020.    

"The amount of the government's initial investment in the fund will be finalised once the 2004/05 final budget outcome is known. On current projections, the initial transfer (including from existing deposits held at the Reserve Bank) will be around $16 billion," the government said.    

The Fund expects to offset the superannuation liabilities by 2020.    

The government will provide $31.2 billion over four years from 2005/06, including $1 million in capital funding to establish the Future Fund Management Agency. An additional $900,000 will be provided in 2005/06 to facilitate the implementation of the fund.    

"Legislation is expected to pass later this year at which time the government will appoint a board and issue an investment mandate, setting broad parameters for investment of the initial capital," the government said.    

The government is forecasting headline cash balances of at least $18 billion per year over 2006/07 to 2008/09, with this money being used to help finance the Future Fund.    

Mr Costello said proceeds from the sale of the final tranche of Telstra would be directed to the Future Fund, which will allow the government to maintain its investment.    

"The object would be to have the full proceeds in the Future Fund," Mr Costello told journalists.    

The government said it expects to generate $3 billion in Future Fund earnings from 2006/07 to 2008/09.    

"Whilst the Fund will invest the money allocated to it, no government will be able to draw money out of it until it is sufficient to meet all the unfunded liabilities to which it is dedicated," Mr Costello said.    

The government also unveiled plans to allow Australians to split superannuation contributions with their spouse from July 1, 2006.    

Splitting will allow low income or non-working spouses to accumulate their own superannuation and will allow funds to offer more flexible products in the market.    

The government also said it plans to ensure that employers pay superannuation on salary or wages back paid to former employees.    

Currently a superannuation guarantee only arises if the recipient of the salary or wages was an employee at some time in the quarter.    

This will be amended to ensure that the superannuation contributions will be due in the quarter that the payment of salary or wages is made.

Filing Chapter 7 bankruptcy will get tougher soon ; New law takes effect in 6 months

President Bush signed legislation Wednesday that will make it more difficult for Americans with large credit card and medical bills to erase their obligations. 

The bill, which represents the most significant change to the nation's bankruptcy laws in 25 years, will make it harder for individuals to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which eliminates most debts. Individuals whose earnings exceed their state's median income will be required to file Chapter 13, which sets up a court-ordered repayment plan. 

Banks and credit card companies have been lobbying for the change for eight years. In a statement, Bush said the law will prevent abuses by people who can afford to pay their debts. 

"This practical reform will help ensure that debtors make a good- faith effort to repay as much as they can afford," Bush said. "This new law will help make credit more affordable, because when bankruptcy is less common, credit can be extended to more people at better rates." 

Critics of the law say it will hurt individuals whose financial problems were caused by illness or unemployment. And consumer groups charge that banks and credit card companies have contributed to the problem by extending credit to vulnerable consumers. 

The law is scheduled to take effect in six months. In the interim, bankruptcy analysts expect a sharp increase in bankruptcy filings as individuals rush to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy before the deadline. Bankruptcy attorneys are expected to take out advertisements urging individuals to file before the law changes. Other possible consequences: 

* Higher costs. The means test won't disqualify most debt-ridden individuals from seeking Chapter 7 protection, says Henry Sommer, president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. He predicts only 1% to 2% of Chapter 7 filers will fail the means test. 

A higher deterrent will be the cost of filing for bankruptcy protection, Sommer says. Now, the costs of filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy range from $500 to $1,500. The new law requires more paperwork and filing, which will result in higher legal fees, he says. 

Some studies have estimated that the law will increase the cost of filing by up to 50%, says Samuel Gerdano, executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute. 

* A boom in the credit-counseling business. The law requires individuals who seek bankruptcy protection to obtain credit counseling at their own expense. 

The National Consumer Law Center says the provision could encourage unscrupulous credit-counseling companies to target consumers seeking to fulfill that provision in the law. 

In recent weeks, the Federal Trade Commission has brought several cases against credit-counseling agencies, charging they have swindled consumers out of millions of dollars. The IRS is investigating whether some credit counselors are abusing non-profit status. 

The law directs a unit of the Justice Department to certify the credit-counseling agencies, but critics say it doesn't provide the resources to carry out that task.

US consumer data props up Australian dollar

The Australian dollar held its ground above US77 ¢ yesterday as a fall in US consumer confidence took the wind out of the US dollar's recent recovery.

The $A remained above US77 ¢ for a second consecutive day after news of a 2 per cent drop in consumer confidence in March triggered a round of profit-taking in the $US. Late yesterday, the $A traded at US77.26 ¢.

Major economic data due to be released in the US and Australia later this week and next week is injecting some uncertainty into the short-term outlook for exchange rates.

"Last week's softening of the Aussie was based around $US strength, but that is much less clear this week with softening consumer confidence figures out of the US," Westpac chief currency strategist Robert Rennie said.

Trading in the $A remained light yesterday and was led mostly by Asian and domestic buyers, Mr Rennie said. Drawing on knowledge gained from a recent trip to Asia, he said: "We got the impression that Asian investors would be significant buyers of $A if it fell to the US76 ¢ to US77 ¢ area."

At the top of the market's watch list are data on the US manufacturing sector, US employment and Australian building approvals all due tomorrow.

Next week is also crammed with major events including the Reserve Bank of Australia's decision on interest rates and Australian retail sales figures and a report on the US non-manufacturing sector.

Mr Rennie said all eyes would be on the RBA's decision next Wednesday and Australian employment figures due next Thursday, as the outcomes of both events were likely to shape the $A's short-term prospects.

"If we did see a 25-basis point rise next week and positive employment figures come out, then those two events would sound the all clear to get back into the Aussie," he said.

"However, if there was no change in domestic interest rates, and a correction in employment, the Aussie could push down to as low as US75.50 ¢."

Yesterday, 30-day interbank cash rate futures contracts showed traders saw a stronger chance of a 25-basis point rate rise in May than next week, with a 90 per cent chance priced in for May compared with 60 per cent for April. The RBA's cash rate is 5.5 per cent.

Macquarie Bank's division director of foreign exchange, Geoff Bowmer, said US interest rates and inflation would stay at the forefront of traders' minds next week.

"We moved last week on the first wave of sentiment about rising inflation, now we are waiting for the second wave of sentiment next week about interest rates," he said.

The US Federal Reserve raised rates by 25 basis points last week and toughened its tone on inflationary risks. Traders are keeping an eye out for data that might add to the case for a 50 basis point rise in US rates.

LARGE-CAP MUTUAL FUNDS are mired in a slump. In each of the past six years, they have lagged behind their smaller -- and apparently nimbler -- competitors, small- and midcap funds.

So far this year, domestic large-cap funds are down 3.44%, about a percentage point behind midcaps but almost a full percentage point ahead of small caps, according to investment-research firm Lipper. It's not exactly an awe-inspiring start, but on some fronts, it is enough to suggest that large caps may be ready to snap out of their funk.

The discounted prices are just one of the reasons that 2005 could be the year of the large cap. The average price/earnings ratio for large-cap funds is 24.1, versus 26.2 for midcaps and 26.5 for small caps, according to Lipper. Another reason is dividends. That more big stocks pay dividends today is making them more attractive for income-seeking investors.

Finally, there is the weak dollar. As a group, large companies do more business abroad, which means they are better positioned to benefit from unfavorable domestic currency rates.

This week, we used our fund screener to search for top-performing large-cap funds in the growth, value, core, and S&P 500-stock index categories with low expenses. Each of the funds on our list is among the top 25% in its classification over the past three and five years, and maintains an expense ratio in the bottom 25%. The less-than-stellar returns, even for the best of the lot, reflect the relative weakness of large caps since the bubble burst in the late '90s. None of these funds carries a load, and each accepts new investors. We also required net assets of no less than $50 million and minimum initial investment requirements of no more than $5,000. Eleven funds made the cut.

Pension shocker for workers under 50: Retirement costs have been systematically underestimated.

The idea that 30 years of retirement can be funded by a working life of 40 years is becoming increasingly un-sustainable at the current level of investment returns and contributions. Yet most corporate pension schemes continue to promise just that. One reason why there has been so little debate over the viability of these promises is that accounting rules obscure their true dimensions.

For example, UK corporate schemes are underfunded to the tune of Pounds 128bn, according to estimates by Mercer, a consultancy. This is just an accounting number, as those pension payments do not need to be made for many years. But the funding gap would be even bigger were the liabilities not discounted at an unrealistic rate.

Ordinarily, long-term liabilities are discounted by the rate at which inflation is expected to erode them. The best proxy for this rate is the yield on long-term government bonds. But under current accounting rules, the discount rate in the UK and US is the AA corporate bond yield - and even then, companies may pick and choose.

Yields on corporate bonds are higher than on government bonds to reflect factors such as credit risk, as well as inflation. But there is no justification for assuming these other factors will shrink pension liabilities. Yet by using a higher discount rate, those liabilities are reduced, sometimes substantially. The resulting shortfalls are often revealed after corporate collapses such as that of United Airlines.

There is a growing body of opinion in the pensions world that the discount rate should be changed. It would force employees and corporate sponsors to face some troubling truths about the affordability of final-salary schemes.

While most companies are increasing pension contributions, they are also relying on superior equity returns to help close the funding gap. One justification for using a higher discount rate is that equity investments will outperform bond returns in the long term. However, the recent bear market has demonstrated the risks with equities.

Unless an investment return higher than the government bond rate can be guaranteed, most pension promises are unaffordable. A traditional final-salary pension funded entirely by gilts would require savings of more than 30 per cent of salary. That is unrealistic for all but the highest paid.

The alternative is to raise the retirement age, so people work longer to fund a shorter retirement. However, the fuss when the British government tried to raise the public-sector retirement age from 60 to 65 suggests this will not be easy. The US public has reacted little better to a similar suggestion for social security. Nor is it simple to phase in retirement with final-salary schemes that base the pension on salary just before stopping work.

The unpalatable truth is that most people under the age of 50 will not be able to retire in their 60s, but must carry on working part-time. Either that or live in penury.

The ongoing popularity of short-term fixed rates is about to give a significant number of borrowers a real shock. Those who locked into two- year fixes in 2003 have enjoyed rates in the 3.5% region for the past 24 months and, apart from minor changes to payments precipitated perhaps by insurance premium alterations, will have been nicely insulated from the multiple increases in base rates we have seen.    

Of course, some will have noticed these changes and might even have given some thought to the impact on their payments post maturity. However, the vast majority will be blissfully ignorant of the huge hike in rates that has occurred. Unfortunately, those of us involved in this industry often assume that everyone is equally enthralled by the activities of the Monetary Policy Committee but in reality, and despite the glaring headlines in the national press, ignorance is bliss - until the lender sends out the fateful letter just before maturity detailing the new monthly payment.    

And it's not just those who are on fixed rates who are in for a nasty surprise. Those on short-term deep discounts will also feel the pain, especially if their payments are on annual review - a year has proved to be a long time in terms of base rate rises.    

From the intermediary's perspective the client will, of course, be eternally grateful for the great deal they've had over the past two years and all the money they've saved compared with their counterparts on variable rates. Dream on! Not only might the borrower develop amnesia about the savings made but, now relegated to history, they may even remember some of the longer term deals that were on offer back then and ask why the possibility of locking into longer protection - albeit at a higher immediate cost - wasn't recommended. They might even have the audacity to wonder if the intermediary who advised them to go for a short-term deal in the sure and certain knowledge that another sweet little deal would be available upon maturity, could just possibly have been influenced by the availability of another proc fee for rebroking their case.    

So what can intermediaries and lenders do to help such borrowers and protect themselves from any (unjustified) accusations of self-interest? No doubt the intermediary will have evidence on file of the customer's desire for short-term savings at the expense of longer term certainty. Also, the market has never been so competitive or innovative and a range of options is available, albeit at pay rates well in excess of those they are accustomed to.    

But it is also in lenders' interests to provide their supporting intermediaries with both competitive products and slick transfer mechanisms to make a strong case for brokers recommending that customers stay where they are - and to recognise the broker's work in proving the case by paying a further proc fee.

Civil partnerships attract tax benefits of marriage But spinsters and the unmarried still miss out, writes Alison Steed

TAX breaks available to married couples can also be enjoyed by gay and lesbian couples from December, if they formalise their relationship through a Civil Partnership. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 comes into effect on December 5, and signing up to the ``civil partnership document'' entitles homosexuals to benefit from spousal benefits previously only accessible through wedlock. But these benefits will not be extended to heterosexual unmarried couples, or for example spinsters who have lived together for many years as companions. Richard Proctor, tax partner at accountants Grant Thornton, said: ``This is discriminatory. Given that people in these situations would also like to transfer assets without penalty, it seems unfortunate that these benefits should not be extended more widely.'' The act itself did not cover issues such as inheritance tax and capital gains tax exemptions enjoyed by spouses, which was corrected in Gordon Brown's Budget this week.        

 For example, from December it would be possible to pass an estate to a civil partner on death without any inheritance tax liability, or to use each others' capital gains tax allowances to maximise reliefs. The ceremony cannot be religious, or take place in a religious building, said Andrew Goldstone, partner at solicitors Mishcon de Reya. He said: ``It is a civil partnership, so it does not have the blessing of God, but does have the blessing of the taxman. You would have to toddle off to your local registry office and you have to have lived in the area for at least seven days.'' The act will allow homosexual couples as young as 16 to enter into a civil partnership, if parental consent is given. As with any traditional marriage, the couple will have to give 15 days' notice of their intention, similar to a traditional couple having their banns read out in church, so that any objections can be made and considered. This means the first ceremonies will be performed on December 21. It will not be possible to apply for a dissolution of a civil partnership until at least one year after its formation, said Mr Goldstone. As with any divorce, this must be done through the courts. There are, however, also some tax disadvantages. Mr Goldstone said: ``One thing to watch out for is that the couple would no longer have two main residency exemptions.'' This would mean that, if the home not considered to be the main residence was sold, it would be subject to capital gains tax. Francesca Lagerberg of accountants Smith & Williamson added: ``The tax credit rules are also being changed. At present, for gay couples, only one partner's salary will come into play for tax credits. If you have got one partner earning pounds 500,000 but the adopted children are being cared for by the partner earning pounds 20,000, they will currently be entitled to tax credits. But this will change.''

QOriginally, we had a normal mortgage, but when we moved the bank recommended a line-of-credit loan. It said if we paid it off early, we'd be ahead. That was possible then, but my husband lost his job four years ago, and at his age probably will never get a full-time job again. So we never paid off any of the loan, bar the interest of $11,000 a year. At the end of 15 years I can see that we will still owe the full amount of $145,000. We will probably sell the house in five years when the children should have left home. Is it worth converting to a normal loan at this stage? We will make money on the house, but it will be absorbed by the outstanding loan. I feel that the banks pushed this home loan tack, but that it can be quite hazardous if one's circumstances change, as ours did.    

AKeep on paying the interest, at $211 a week it is cheaper than rent. Even if you still owe the entire sum after 15 years, you are probably in a better position than if you had rented, and you may achieve some capital gain on the home as well. You could talk to other lenders to see if they are interested in refinancing your loan, but take care, the cost of doing this outweighs the interest saved.    

QI salary sacrifice into my super fund fortnightly and hope to be close to the RBL soon. But my wife has minimal super because she has been at home for the past 10 years with the children. Can I salary sacrifice into her super? She earns less than $10,000 a year.    

AYou cannot salary sacrifice into your wife's superannuation fund under existing rules, but we expect the legislation that will allow taxpayers to divert up to 60 per cent of their annual contributions to their spouse will be passed this June. She is not working, so will not be eligible for a co-contribution, but you can make a $3000 contribution for her and receive a spouse rebate of $540.    

QI have an insurance bond of $115,000 that has reached its 10-year limit for tax-free withdrawal. I am still contributing because it produces good returns (12.5 per cent in nine months). I am semi-retired and my average tax rate is 13 per cent this financial year. Should I cash this and invest elsewhere, given the policy is taxed at 30 per cent on earnings, leave it as is, or invest all or part in super?    

AYou are semi-retired, so I assume you're at least 50. If so, it makes good sense to harvest the proceeds tax-free then invest the money in superannuation. You would get higher returns because super funds pay income tax at just 15 per cent a year, half that paid by the insurance bond.

Self-employed home buyers no longer penalised, says Charcol

Self-employed home buyers have had a rough ride in the past, but mortgage broker Charcol reckons the tide is turning.    

One of the major difficulties for many self-employed homebuyers is that they often have to pay a higher rate of interest on their mortgage borrowing, are offered a lower multiple of income as a maximum loan, and they have to produce three years audited accounts as proof of income before a lender will consider their application. This latter may be impossible for someone who has just started up in business.    

But the huge growth in the number of self-employed people and improvements in credit checking means that many lenders now offer their entire range of mortgages to self employed people wanting loans of up to 75% of the value of their property, and they no longer pay more for their borrowing.    

In 2002 there were 292,374 new business start-ups, leaping to 396,339 in 2003. The industry has undergone a period of very significant development over the last few years, mainly concerning the ways in which mortgage applications are underwritten, and many self-employed borrowers can now reap these benefits, explains Ray Boulger of mortgage broker Charcol.    

The greater efficiency in the way in which data on potential borrowers is shared and communicated between credit reference agencies and lenders means that with some lenders the whole process has become much more streamlined, less admin-heavy and therefore substantially quicker.    

Boulger maintains: No longer is the burden of proof of income laid heavily on the borrower. Instead, if a borrower gets a clean bill of financial health from a credit reference agency, then they can, in the majority of cases, get a decision on the spot.    

He points out that most of the mainstream lenders now offer all of their rates on a self-certification basis up to 75% loan to value. Five years ago this was unheard of, and even the most attractive self-cert deals would have charged a rate at least one per cent higher, says Boulger.    

Self-employed borrowers should review their current mortgage, as they have a much greater choice in the length, type and cost of their mortgage, and will often no longer effectively be penalised for their self-employed status.    

Many self-employed people, particularly those who have recently started their business, will want the certainty of a fixed rate. Charcol has a wide range of fixed rates on offer including 4.68% for 25 months from Portman Building Society and 4.69% fixed for 26 months from Alliance & Leicester, as well as a five year fix from the Newcastle Building Society at 4.8%.    

There is also a two-year discount available with an initial pay rate of 4.48% from Portman Building Society or a three-year discount at a pay rate of 4.7% from the Cheshire Building Society. For full details of all offers visit    www.charcolonline.co.uk .

GAO's Walker: Private Accts Would Hurt Soc Sec Finances

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--A key element of President George W. Bush's Social Security overhaul plan, taken alone, would exacerbate the retirement plan's financial problems, Comptroller General David Walker told a House panel on Wednesday.    

Walker, testifying before the House Ways and Means Committee, spoke about private investment accounts that "carve out" a portion of Social Security taxes and divert them into private stocks or bonds.    

"If private accounts or individual accounts are carve outs...they exacerbate the solvency problem," said Walker, who oversees the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency for Congress.    

"Carve-outs, by themselves and with no other reforms, will exacerbate the problems," Walker told the House Ways and Means Committee. "Irrespective of what the other reforms are, they will accelerate the negative cash flows."    

Democrats heralded Walker's testimony, saying it backed up their assertions that Bush's proposed Social Security investment accounts will worsen the retirement system's finances.    

"I think your testimony has been extremely helpful," Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., told Walker.    

But Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., sought to minimize the damage, saying the private accounts should be viewed only in conjunction with other major changes to Social Security, such as benefit cuts.    

"The facts are, if you do it correctly, if you do it properly and if you structure it right, personal accounts funded through a carve-out can in fact solve the problems of Social Security," McCrery said. That's because Social Security taxes diverted to stocks will grow faster than the system's current investments, he said.    

Walker echoed remarks by Democrats that Social Security doesn't face an immediate financial crisis. Bush has embarked on a nationwide tour to publicize Social Security's financial straits.    

Walker also noted Congress faces larger financial challenges with social entitlements, such as Medicare.    

But he urged Congress to begin work as soon as possible on a solution to Social Security's long-term problems.    

"The program is unsustainable in its current form," Walker said. "You will have to act. It's only a matter of when you act, how you act."    

The testimony comes as the tax writing panel held its first hearing on Social Security, Bush's signature domestic issue for his second term. Bush has proposed allowing workers born after 1950 to invest up to 4% of their income into stocks and bonds through new private investment accounts. This will require the borrowing of $754 billion over the next decade to finance the transition to the new system.    

Bush is proposing these changes because, beginning in 2018, Social Security's spending will exceed receipts from tax revenue, according to Social Security trustees. The program will be able to pay full promised benefits until 2042. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected the program will be solvent until 2052.

Payday loans call for tighter regulation    

Dire financial problems can lead people to seek loans that are perfectly legal but can become perfectly ruinous.    

In Sunday's editions, Daily Herald business writer Emily Krone told the stories of two suburban residents who turned to payday loans. One, a Palatine woman in her mid-40s with a good job and two children, took out a payday loan when her ex-husband froze the couple's joint assets during their divorce proceedings. She borrowed $400, but when she could not keep pace with terms calling for escalating interest rates, the lender sued, and the loan eventually cost her $2,200.    

Another woman, a marketing manager from the South suburbs, gives an even more harrowing account. She borrowed $400 from a payday lender and agreed to pay that sum plus $360 in interest two weeks later. She managed to make her payments but only by assuming new loans. Eventually, she took out 33 loans - yes, 33 - and shelled out more than $13,000 in interest.    

Isolated stories? Hardly. Krone reports that more than 700 licensed payday loan locations operate in Illinois. And while some may assume payday loans are limited mostly to low-income urban neighborhoods, large numbers of payday loan centers populate the suburbs. The industry is characterized by short terms and high interest on loans secured by post-dated checks, which represents the obvious attraction for borrowers of limited means who need cash and need it right now.    

The explosive growth of payday loan operations suggests a strong demand for their services, and no one, of course, is forcing consumers in their direction. Presumably, borrowers enter into these agreements with their eyes open.    

That, however, does not preclude the case for tighter regulation. A proposal in Springfield would limit loan amounts to one-quarter of a borrower's monthly income or $1,000, whichever is less. It would hold the line on fees at $16 per $100 lent. It would prohibit payday lenders from making additional loans to borrowers who still have outstanding balances on two payday loans elsewhere in Illinois. It also would let borrowers, after 35 days of outstanding debt, select a repayment plan that would grant at least 56 days to repay and to do so with no new fees or interest.    

The industry calls the proposals too stringent; there may be room for lenders to haggle with legislators over the details. But the proposals laid out in Springfield certainly represent the right direction in tighter regulation. Consumers clearly deserve greater protection than they now have. Even for loans that offer this kind of convenience to higher-risk borrowers, the charging of 520 percent annual interest - the average for Illinois payday loans - is simply beyond all reason. There is room - and need - for tighter regulations that will keep payday lenders in the state and leave this avenue of borrowing open for consumers, but with less room for borrowers being taken for a far more expensive ride than they expected.

The Week Invest in shares? The TAB's as good a bet

That the sharemarket is one of the greatest frauds perpetrated on humankind since organised religion makes Michael Cullen's call for people to invest their hard-earned savings in the sharemarket, and not houses, all the more absurd.      

Still, this was the man who, rather than mooting the idea of developing a world-leading system of intellectual property advice, research assistance, and marketing support for backyard inventors, stated merely that we as a nation should get over the romance of the backyard inventor and the myth of our No 8 wire mentality.      

Reading the curmudgeonly Cullen's economic analysis, one could easily forget that the economic units to which he refers are people.      

One could almost suspect that Labour has forgotten what the labour unit is.      

The only wealth he has created with his pronouncement is a wealth of sharp- suited bankers and brokers admonishing the proletariat for not doing their bit to invest in the economy.      

What they don't say is that it is called the sharemarket because the money you invest is then shared among these shysters and shylocks who have all done their darndest to wheedle it from you.      

What really riles is the repeated use of the phrase ``invest your savings'' in the sharemarket, rather than the more accurate ``have a flutter''.      

Cloaked in a wafer-thin veneer of respectability, the sharemarket is the financial equivalent of investing in a pokie machine, but with no guaranteed payout.      

Given the parlous state of some companies maybe Cullen should instead consider advising people to invest in the bloodstock industry, or the TAB.      

Not that the sharemarket is completely dire. Many companies do well, but it's just that they're never the ones you invest in.      

Cullen seems almost as out of touch with reality as the growing number of New Zealand men who don't seem to understand that if their partner leaves them it might be because they are morons.      

They then prove how right these women were, when they demonstrate their subhuman imbecility by slaughtering their hapless women as if they were hoggets.      

In this week of weak men, another predictable rugby league scandal erupted, and rather than attribute the blame to the obvious cause of the trouble - the players and their drunken antics - it was instead blamed on a lack of security.      

It seems that in league circles security is a euphemism for highly paid men being too stupid to look after themselves.      

That some of the players involved had recently attended a seminar on how to treat women adds to the irony of the situation.      

Initially, a seminar on how to treat women seemed to me to make as much sense as a seminar on how to breathe.      

But with more motherless children popping up every week in this accursed land, I have begun to suspect that making this a prescribed subject at high school would be one excellent investment this country could make.

Creating a System Of Incentive Pay That Works for You

WASHINGTON -- Incentive compensation can help achieve corporate goals or undermine them.      

Good plans are clear, simple, and predictable; employees know in advance just how much they will earn for doing what is wanted. Flawed plans confuse and frustrate them and spur them to actions the planners never contemplated.      

Successful incentive pay programs also require senior management support, an effective launch, and enforcement of ethics.      

Here are some considerations in making sure your incentive dollars are well spent:      

Volume versus value. Be sure that your goals will not yield lots of activity and sales but little shareholder value. For example, as you compensate for unit sales, are you getting real sales or just product splitting (that is, five $1,000 CDs each instead of one $5,000 CD)? There is no incremental value to the former, so the incentive should not be higher.      

Product goals. Go into these with your eyes open. Unit sales are easy to track -- that is one reason so many banks base incentives on them -- but to emphasize them may put the employee's interest at odds with the customer's. Such contradictions should be reconciled before an incentive plan is promulgated.      

Customer retention. Most incentive plans target a specific volume of sales -- for example, 50 new loans or $50 millions of new loan originations. Such goals divert attention from current customers and may increase attrition; achieving them may leave the bank and the shareholders worse off.      

Is it possible to include a retention component in acquisition-oriented plans? Many do. For example, good plans have separate goals for cross-selling to new households (which is easy to measure) and current customers.      

Make it controllable. Incentives for results your employees cannot control become de-motivators.      

Team versus individual goals. Team goals encourage cooperation but also reward shirkers and discourage star producers. Be explicit on your approach.      

How much incentive? Are you interested in increasing the ratio of incentive dollars to base pay? This is an important philosophical issue.      

Frequency of payment. Though employees should not count on incentives as part of base pay, prompt payment is a motivator. At most banks, incentive pay goes to senior management annually, to branch managers and loan officers quarterly, and to tellers and others monthly.      

Tallying cross-sales. What counts in the calculation? The biggest banks count everything and the kitchen sink. The downside is encouraging folks to sell products you don't want them to sell -- say, ATM cards instead of debit cards.      

Also, how long do you keep the sales session open for the cross-selling calculation? Just until the customer leaves the bank after opening a first account? Or long enough for bankers to check back with them to offer other products?      

Ms. Bird, a former banking executive, now heads SCB Forums of Granite Bay, Calif., which organizes meetings of supercommunity bankers.

Caisse in Canada's top 25% of pension funds in 2004: Second solid year in row

MONTREAL - The Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec yesterday said it made a top-tier return in 2004 as chief executive Henri-Paul Rousseau continued to reshape the 40-year-old Quebec institution, Canada's largest institutional investor.    

The Caisse said the funds invested by its depositors -- 20 pension and insurance funds in Quebec, including the Quebec Pension Plan -- posted a 12.2% return last year, increasing net assets by $10.8-billion to $102.4-billion at year-end. That placed it within the top 25% of all pension funds in Canada, but down from its 15.2% return in 2003.    

Still, it's the second straight year of solid gains for the Caisse, which Mr. Rousseau has overhauled after years of poor management and bad investment decisions under the leadership of predecessor Jean-Claude Scraire. The Caisse lost 9.6% in 2002 -- worse than its peers in the industry -- and 5% in 2001. "It's excellent news for all depositors that invest with the Caisse," Mr. Rousseau said of the 2004 result.    

The focus of the former CEO of Laurentian Bank of Canada has been on matching or beating the Caisse's benchmark indexes by installing a "performance culture" while beefing up risk management, cutting operating costs and outsourcing management of some portfolios. He helped draft an overhaul to the Quebec law governing the Caisse to give it autonomy from government and free it of the obligation to foster Quebec's economic growth    

While achieving most of what he set out to do, Mr. Rousseau has found himself playing catch-up in an increasingly complicated world for fund managers, trying to match the private equity success of Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and beef up the Caisse's exposure to such sophisticated but risky investment sectors as hedge funds.    

The Caisse's past strength in the bond market has become less of an edge with tightening spreads. "Everything is trading close to U.S. treasuries," he said. "The risk premium is almost not there."    

As for the Caisse's investments in the stock market (it is the largest owner of stocks in Canada), he said the market has become increasingly efficient with the growth of hedge funds, and "we have to be very quick to size up opportunities." The Caisse's stock portfolio gained 12.6% in 2004, just below the benchmark    

The explosion in alternative investments has also sucked talent out of the industry; Mr. Rousseau said he has 100 finance jobs he's trying to fill, up from 45 last year.    

The Caisse's perennially strong real estate business returned a record 22.7% gain last year, a full 7.6 percentage points ahead of the benchmark index compiled by AON Consulting. Its private placements also gained 20.5%, almost three percentage points above the norm and a turnaround from earlier this decade.

Private investor - Irish rugby stars tackle residential investment with Hands-Off fund.

Glasgow-based investor teams up with rugby players for fund aimed at sports professionals.    

Irish rugby stars Paul Wallace, David Humphreys and Ryan Constable have teamed up with Glasgow-based residential investment company, Urban Pulse Property Investments, to launch a residential property fund aimed at professional sportsmen and women.    

The Hands-off Investment Fund is the latest in a series of vehicles enabling smaller investors to invest alongside celebrities. It will source discounted city centre off-plan or new-build residential property in areas with strong tenant demand and good potential for capital growth.    

The fund managers hope to raise £1.5m of equity and the minimum investment is £15,000. All equity will be pooled and geared in order to approach developers and agents with readily available funds. It is expected that the fund will produce an annual return of 20%-25%.    

The fund will be 'live' for a period of five to seven years, depending on market conditions. Investors will have the option to sell their shares and opt out of the scheme at any time.    

Urban Pulse is already targeting off-plan residential projects to go into the fund, including the Parkside Developments scheme on Warren Road in Hartlepool.    

James Patterson, managing director of Urban Pulse, said: 'Professional sports players don't always know when their career might end, so it makes sense for them to seek investment advice which provides them with financial security after they retire from their sports.    

'The Hands-off Investment Fund is as an investment vehicle for professional sportsmen and women which looks after their investments for them, letting them focus on their careers, free from any concerns about their future finances.'    

Several high-profile rugby players have already committed to the fund, and discussions with well-known figures from other sports disciplines are thought to be at an advanced stage.    

Ordinary investors have also demonstrated an interest in the fund.    

Patterson added: 'In addition to interest from Irish speculators, I've been fielding enquiries from as far afield as Australia, New Zealand and New York. The investors are looking for opportunities in the Scottish property market. Clearly, Scotland has an international reputation amongst property investors as a country with great potential for future growth.'    

Former British and Irish Lion Paul Wallace, who set up sports management company Cornerflag with Ireland rugby union teammates Humphreys and Constable in June 2003, hopes that the fund will encourage sports professionals to think about providing for themselves after retirement.    

Wallace said: 'An important part of our role in player management is to encourage and facilitate sound investment by our clients. Players are encouraged to think about 'life after rugby' and to develop exit strategies from an early stage in their careers.    

'The property market has proved a historically sound and successful investment vehicle and we actively encourage involvement in this area.'    

Urban Pulse estimates the Hands-Off Investment Fund will be fully subscribed by March.

SKANDIA: Skandia Sipp    

Type: Full self-invested personal pension    

Minimum investment: Lump sum £1,000, £150 a month    

Investment choice: SIM - range of Skandia investment funds, Self Select - UK quoted shares, gilts and debentures, Aim stocks, unit trusts, investment trusts, Oeics, insurance company funds, commercial property, land and all other Inland Revenue permitted investments    

Charges: Establishment charge - £150, annual charge - £160 if Sipp invests only in Skandia funds, £360 if Sipp invests in external funds, transfers in - £60 a transfer up to maximum of £300, vesting benefits and transfers out - £75, income drawdown - £150 a year, telegraphic transfer £25, additional costs for commercial property    

Commission: Initial up to 3%, renewal up to 1%    

Tel: 023 8072 9761    

The Skandia Sipp is a full Sipp providing access to a range of Skandia funds, externally managed funds and other Inland Revenue-permitted investments, including commercial property.    

Origen technical manager Bob Perkins says: "It is a generally accepted fact that the wider investment options available from April 6, 2006, proposed under the pension simplification regime, are likely to result in an increased interest in Sipps as a means of saving for retirement." He believes the bulk of the interest is likely to result from the ability to hold residential property within a Sipp.    

Examining the Skandia product in detail, Perkins says: "This product provides all the flexibility you would expect from a Sipp provider positioning itself for the new opportunities. There are three options for investment - discretionary management can be provided through multi- manager, advisers can provide advisory management through self-select and full investment flexibility can be obtained through a full Sipp if required."    

Casting an eye over the product literature, Perkins finds it easy to read and well presented. He says: "The charging structure is explained simply in comparison to some other plans in the market and is competitive. However, advisers would be well advised to provide as much information about property purchases to Skandia at an early stage to determine what charges will apply. Higher than standard charges may apply for multi-tenanted properties, complex arrangements or where significant development or refurbishment is likely to take place."    

Perkins points out that Skandia is not the pension provider nor the administrators or trustee. He says: "These roles are undertaken by third parties - the Bank of Scotland and Sippdeal Trustees. Skandia is unique in that it is the first life company to have an arrangement with Sippdeal and I would expect the relationship to develop further."    

Perkins thinks competition will come from Standard Life, GE Pensions, James Hay and other established Sipp providers. He concludes: "Overall, I like the plan. I expect more players to come to the market with relaunched products and competitive positions may change as those who are in early need to review their position. However, I would expect Skandia to remain in the forefront both in terms of development and competitive edge."

Here 's today 's tip: beware the golf club gossip

CITY AND BUSINESS EDITED BY PETER CUNLIFFE

IN THE second of a monthly series, TREVOR WEBSTER, market-beating share expert, says you should think twice before you put your money in the hands of the 'professionals'

BEWARE saloon-bar tips, golfclub gossip and the advice of experts if you want to get rich slowly by investing on the stock market. Small investors are most likely to prosper by picking their own shares.

Many City experts and fund managers w ere hard hit when they joined bar-room tipsters in recommending high-tech shares which had already soared from a few pence to £20 or £30. The bear market of 2000-03 turned them into penny stocks.

Many small investors have suffered by handing over their savings to experts. A friend handed £50,000 to a stockbroker w ho made promises of safe-keeping, regular reports and "active management".

The broker split the money only five ways and my friend was furious when one of the companies went bust without any warning from the broker and £10,000 was lost.

Another friend inherited £100,000, invested in sound, high-yielding shares but was advised by her bank she needed "professional management". The bank switched a quarter of the portfolio into unit trusts, spending a fortune on commission and management fees.

Of course, everyone makes mistakes, no one can predict the future, and investment in shares should always carry a risk w arning. But before you follow the advice of City analysts or buy "professionally managed" funds, consider these facts:

Surveys, such as recent ones from Intelligent Money and Micropal, show three of four "actively managed" funds w hich rely on "expert advice" underperform the stock market.

Intelligent Money says only three in 20 of Britain's best-known "growth funds" have managed to beat the market during the past 10 years. It blames rising fees and the poor performance caused by too much switching between shares.

Most of the City's leading investment houses have called the market wrong half of the time during the past four years - and they almost always predicted a rise. At the start of 2000, the big brigade forecast the Footsie would rise 14 per cent and close the year well above 7,000.

It fell 10 per cent to about 6,000.

Most analysts' research in Britain has traditionally advised share "buys". They have outnumbered "sell" recommendations by around seven to one.

A survey in America showed only 2 per cent were "sells". This has to be a disastrous formula in years when markets fall.

Analysts' work is not all useless: it reflects company bosses' briefings. The lesson of the past five years is to employ research generated by big banks and brokers, which can give a glimpse of the future and sway share prices.

But take the actual tips with a pinch of salt and remember: fund managers need you far more than you need them.

Lending Conference Discusses Higher Education Act Reauthorization, 'Inducements'

Election results were cheered by attendees of CBA's Student Lending Conference, Nov. 7-9, who feared a Kerry win would lead to renewed emphasis on Direct Lending. However, with the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act held over to the next Congress, again, uncertainties remain.    

Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, predicted the Committee would quickly pass a bill by Spring similar to the one sponsored by Committee Chairman John Boehner, R-Ohio.    

In the Senate, however, Sen. Judd Gregg, R-NH, announced he is stepping down as Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to pursue the Chairmanship of the Senate Budget Committee.    

Senator Michael Enzi, R-WY, is expected to take the Chairmanship when the Senate reconvenes in January.    

Sen. Enzi is expected to be a thoughtful and engaged chairman who will do a good job managing higher education and the many other - some far stickier - issues in the committee's jurisdiction, such as pension reform and health care.    

The stickiest lender issue remains future treatment of the consolidation loan program, and federal deficits will continue to play a role. A Republican effort to restrain tuition hikes has much of the college lobby lined up against the House bill.    

Stock analyst Chuck Gabriel, Senior Vice President, Prudential securities, said, "This is a great business," particularly for Sallie Mae, which he described as a "Bush stock," evidenced by a substantial post-election rise.    

Sallie Mae Vice Chairman and CEO Al Lord told attendees that his company would be fully privatized ahead of schedule, before Inaugural Day. "FELP (Family Education Loan Program) is as perfectly designed as any government program," he said. However, he added, "Little flaws inhibit serious investors and encourage scavengers."    

Inducements Issue    

Another issue overhanging the business, "inducements," was the topic of a panel discussion. CBA and other industry groups have sought additional clarification from the Department of Education regarding Higher Education Act limits on inducements prohibitions between lenders and schools. The Department has not provided additional guidance, leaving participants to consider voluntary guidelines. 

CBA has been working with the National Association of School Financial Aid Administrators on voluntary guidelines, but NASFAA President Dallas Martin said his board was unable to endorse draft guidelines proposed by the industry.    

In spite of this setback, CBA joined with the National Council of Higher Education Loan Programs, and the Education Finance Council, to endorse and release the voluntary guidelines. The Nov. 16 press release and guidelines are posted on the Student Lending page of CBA's website,    www.cbanet.org . Sallie Mae also supports the guidelines, according to Executive Vice President Kevin Moehn.    

Election results were cheered by attendees of CBA's Student Lending Conference, who feared a Kerry win would lead to renewed emphasis on Direct Lending. However, with the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act held over to the next Congress, again, uncertainties remain.

Whew! Oil Ends a 5-Day Surge

CRUDE-OIL PRICES declined for a change, but not enough to help the stock market, with key computer-chip makers and financial-services firms leading the way lower.

After five straight sessions in which oil futures hit daily new records for the 21-year history of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, prices yesterday fell 2.1%, or $1.13, to $52.51 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, in what traders described as a needed breather after the record run. Oil futures had hit $54 early yesterday morning in electronic trading during the so-called overnight session, but sold off sharply once Nymex's regular floor trading opened.

However, experts say the respite could be short-lived, since global supply and demand for crude oil remain in precariously tight balance. "We can't afford to lose one drop," said energy broker Mike Fitzpatrick, of Fimat USA. Another sign of oil's prominence came late yesterday when Nymex members said a full membership-seat on the exchange sold for $2 million -- a record.

Crude's one-day weakness took some pressure off stocks but ultimately couldn't prevent slight declines in major indexes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 4.79 points, or 0.1%, to close at 10077.18. The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 0.2%, or 3.59 points, to 1925.17. And the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index closed at 1121.84, down 0.2%, or 2.55 points.

Merrill Lynch provided one of the major downbeat notes for the day. The brokerage firm reported an 8.3% decline in third-quarter profit.

Shares in Intel Corp. were also markedly lower ahead of the chip maker's earnings release after the close. Investors had been spooked about the technology bellwether since last week, when the company warned of slack demand for semiconductors.

In its announcement after-hours, Intel reported a 15% rise in earnings, driven by server and mobile microprocessor shipments. The company's gross margin, however, came in below its own projections. Intel shares rose 73 cents, or 3.6%, to $21.01 in after-hours trading. It was the most active stock in the after-hours market.

Outside the U.S., stocks fell in dollar terms. The Dow Jones World Stock Index, excluding U.S. stocks, fell 1.3%, or 2.05 points, to 152.00.

In major U.S. market action:

Stocks declined. On the New York Stock Exchange, where 1.32 billion shares traded, 1,548 stocks rose and 1,713 stocks fell.

Bonds advanced. The 10-year Treasury note rose 7/32, or $2.19 per $1,000 face amount, pushing down the yield to 4.102%. The 30-year bond rose 12/32 to yield 4.88%.

The dollar rose. In late New York trading, the currency rose to 109.73 yen from 109.37 the day before; the euro weakened against the dollar to $1.2328 from $1.2382.

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, it's been easy to forget about the potentially ugly tax hit that mutual funds can generate. After all, to have a large capital-gains distribution, a mutual fund needs one very important thing: gains. Even last year -- a rosy one for the stock market -- didn't generate much in the way of tax bills. That's because many funds still had plenty of losses on their books after the three-year bear market to offset any recent gains.

This year is also expected to be modest on the capital-gains distribution front. That's because 2004 hasn't exactly been a banner year for fund performance. But even if you slide by this year without owing much in taxes on your fund accounts, you shouldn't stop thinking about taxes -- especially when shopping for a new fund. After all, you'd hate to discover further down the line that a fund you selected is, in fact, a tax trap.

An easy way to seek tax efficiency is to buy a tax-managed fund like the T. Rowe Price Tax-Efficient Growth Fund, which made our list this week. Tax-managed funds make tax-efficiency a priority, as specified in their prospectus. Keep in mind that there are lots of tax-efficient funds out there that aren't explicitly tax-managed. But those that are should do better than their average peer on the tax front.

We screened for no-load funds in the upper 20% of their respective classifications based on tax efficiency and total return. We also demanded that the funds have an expense ratio in the bottom 50% of their classification. Other criteria: net assets of $50 million or more, minimum initial investments of $5,000 or less and availability to new investors.

A slim seven equity funds made our list, including two sector funds. Note: The no-load version of one of our picks -- Safeco Small-Cap Value Fund -- isn't available directly through its fund family, but can be purchased via mutual-fund supermarkets.

FT MONEY - PENSIONS
The risk of a false sense of security AUSTRALIA.

Those who support the introduction of a compulsory occupational pension in the UK often look to Australia, where the system has been in place for more than a decade.

Since 1992, all employers have been required to make a compulsory contribution for their employees into a privately managed pension - known locally as asuperannuation or "super" fund. The contribution rate started at 3 per cent of employee's earnings, but was raised to 9 per cent in 2002.

The Superannuation Guarantee was introduced by the then Labor government in an effort to reduce reliance on the state pension, known as the Age Pension.

About 90 per cent of working men and women in Australia are now covered by "super", although the Age Pension remains the primary income source for most retirees.

Employees can also make voluntary contributions towards their "super". They are given tax incentives to do this.

The Age Pension - unlike the UK's basic pension - is asset- and income-tested. It is pegged at 25 per cent of average male weekly basic earnings for a single person.

Unlike the British who have little flexibility as to how they draw their private pensions, Australians may choose to have their "super" pot paid as a lump sum, or may use it to buy an annuity or other form of pension income.

Supporters of the superannuation system, which mirrors one in Chile, say it has successfully weaned Australians off the idea of sole reliance on the Age Pension. Others see the scheme as having transformed the country's long-term savings industry, with Australia's fund management sector now the fourth largest in the world, reflecting the success of occupational pensions.

But critics say the reliance on employer contributions has lulled Australians into a false sense of security about their retirement income. Statistics show many do not feel they have to save anything extra for their retirement. Many Australians on low-to-average incomes are not expected to have enough for a comfortable retirement, supporting calls for the 9 per cent rate to be increased.

Alison O'Connell, director of the UK's Pensions Policy Institute, says compulsion is not a panacea for the ailments of the UK's pension policy. She says it was introduced in an era of high inflation in Australia - which had the desired effect of deferring wage increases - and that this is not the situation in the UK. "It is wrong to think about compulsion on its own as being the only solution," she says. "We have to get the first tier right - and that is the basic state pension."

Stewart Richie, director of pensions development at Scottish Equitable, says Australians' reliance on compulsion has led to a reduction in discretionary saving: "It looks like Australia needs to increase the level of compulsory pensions significantly higher than 9 per cent and to find ways of stopping people borrowing against future pension expectations."

Promoters of illegal early-access superannuation plans can expect a call or visit from the corporate regulator, part of a nationwide crackdown on the practice.      

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission is conducting a sweep of about 50 companies and individuals offering early access to super benefits, in conjunction with the Tax Office and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority.      

The rules governing early access to superannuation are tight. Before retirement, benefits can be accessed only in limited circumstances, such as termination of employment after 55 years of age, severe financial hardship, permanent incapacity, compassionate grounds, temporary incapacity where the member's residence has to be modified for invalid use, or permanent departure from Australia.      

ASIC has been warning members of funds since February not to be tempted by early access to super so that it can be used to pay out debts, meet living expenses or buy a home.      

Its warnings then were along the lines that such schemes were not only illegal but that they typically involve substantial payments to scheme promoters.      

ASIC's director of financial services, Ian Johnston, said that inquiries had determined that many of the people advising members to take out their super early were not licensed to give financial advice on super.      

"Many of the people advising on setting up these schemes are not licensed in any way and many of them are just scamsters, frankly," Mr Johnston said.      

Many, according to Mr Johnston, advise members to take the money out of an existing fund, put it into a newly established self-managed fund so that they have better access and then they, the promoters, help themselves to the members' money.      

In the past two months ASIC has tested over 50 advisers and funds for compliance. Mr Johnston said some checks were continuing.      

Activities detected by this sweep have raised ASIC concerns about misleading conduct or statements, including advertising and promotional material, inducing people to dispose of their existing super interests and establish a self-managed super fund, and unlicensed financial services including advice and dealing in financial products.      

To comply with the law all members of self-managed funds must be trustees of the fund or the trustee be a corporate trustee.      

"Promoters will often market [self-managed funds] by saying that superannuation is 'your money' which can be transferred into 'your bank account'," Mr Johnston said.      

As a trustee of a self-managed funds, a person must keep the assets of the fund separate from other assets, manage the assets in accordance with strict investment rules and operate the fund for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits.      

In the past four years ASIC has initiated 29 civil and eight criminal actions against promoters of illegal early-access schemes, accounting for more than $20 million benefits illegally accessed.      

But that does not mean that the super benefits lost by members through early access scams is always recovered.

umbrella will target retail market and comprise four existing funds plus distribution vehicle    

Clerical Medical has launched an Oeic into the retail market comprised of four rebadged funds and a distribution portfolio.    

The Ucits III umbrella was previously known as the Bank of Scotland Investors Club Oeic, a part of the HBoS group that Clerical Medical has since taken over and rebranded under its own banner.    

Insight Investment, another HBoS subsidiary, will manage the five funds, with further launches, particularly protected portfolios, expected in due course.    

Insight's head of asset allocation Philip Barleggs manages the Distribution and Balanced Managed funds, while head of passive funds Paul Chu runs the FTSE 100 Tracker portfolio.    

The Distribution portfolio builds on the group's existing Life Distribution fund capabilities, which Barleggs ran using the same objective, benchmark asset allocation and management approach.    

The aim of the fund is to provide growing income together with a balance between capital stability and long-term growth, with Barleggs focusing on UK securities and fixed interest. As a Ucits III vehicle, the fund can also invest in units in other collective schemes, warrants and money market instruments.    

Of the remaining funds, Insight's Alex Illingworth heads up the Global International Managed portfolio, while Daniel Fox runs the UK fixed interest-oriented Income vehicle.    

Investment marketing manager at Clerical Medical Jon Baker said with existing positions in the life bond and pensions markets, the group sees mutual funds as an area with strong growth potential. Clerical Medical is launching the Oeic under its own brand, despite Insight's established position in the mutual funds market, as the former appeals to a different set of advisers with its strong reputation for running managed, distribution and with-profits offerings, he noted.    

Clerical Medical has introduced a regular withdrawal element on the funds of up to 7.5% of the value of accumulation shares per year to appeal to investment bond clients. Although tax is not deferred, as with the 5% annual allowance on investment bonds, this facility still caters for clients looking for a consistent and steady income stream, Baker said.    

As this withdrawal comes from selling units, investors can offset it against their annual capital gains tax allowance. There is also an Auto Isa facility available, enabling automatic annual transfers from the Oeic into an Isa.    

Minimum investment for the funds is £10,000 lump sum and £400 per month for direct investments, falling to a £3,000 lump sum and £200 monthly via an Isa.    

Charges on the funds are 4% initial and 1% annual, with no exit charges and free switching within the various sub-funds. The stated AMC includes fund administration expenses that are usually charged to the fund, so the annual charge and total expense ratio are the same, at 1%.    

Adviser commission on the range is 3% initial plus 0.5% per year trail. On Isa and Pep transfer business, commission is 0.5% initial and 0.5% trail.

WITH two interest rate rises in the last year and the likelihood of more later this year, many people may be considering refinancing their home loan to take advantage of better deals.    

But how do you determine whether refinancing is the ideal strategy for you?    

Many owners refinance to gain a better rate and save money over the life of the loan. Others refinance to consolidate debts, buy an investment property, renovate or to diversify investments.    

On the downside, moving loans to a new lender can be time-consuming and complex.    

Staying with your existing lender often seems so much easier. However, you should do the sums to determine whether it is right for you as you may find yourself thousands of dollars better off.    

In a heated property market, everyone is keen to pick up your business. There are many different types of loans, all offering a range of features.    

Make sure you do your own research.    

You may discover your existing loan is the right one for you.    

A home loan is more than just an interest rate - it's a package.    

One way to understand the full cost of a loan is to look at the comparison rate.    

This differs from the annual percentage rate as it reflects all of the determinable fees and charges on that account.    

In some cases, particularly honeymoon rates, there can be quite a difference between the comparison rate and the advertised rate, so make sure the loan you choose has all the features and benefits you require and a good comparison rate.    

You should definitely not change lenders until you take into consideration every aspect of the new loan.    

First and foremost is the need to ensure there is no penalty to exit your existing loan. Check with your lender first before you sign anything.    

Other important considerations are fees, loan features, flexibility (can you make fortnightly or lump sum payments?) and, importantly, service.    

You may have built up a strong relationship with your current lender and it should not be sacrificed just to jump into a deal that is exactly the same.    

Talk to your lender first - they may be willing to negotiate.    

Be sure, not sorry    

IF you are considering refinancing, make sure you know the answers to the following questions:    

ARE there any significant payout penalties to get out of your current loan?    

WHAT is the cost of applying for the new loan?    

ARE there any new legal costs associated with the new loan?    

WHAT about mortgage insurance? Will you have to pay more?    

DOES the new loan offer you more flexibility?    

DOES your new loan give you access to additional funds should you need them?    

CAN you have your new loan spilt to suit your present and future needs?    

DO split-loan facility fees apply?    

HOW long will the process to move to a new loan take?

With energy costs so high now, is my winter heating bill going to destroy my finances?

Q: The price of petrol is killing me this summer. I'm already dreading winter -- how bad are my home heating bills likely to be?      

A: While crude oil's climb to record high prices has made it likely that home heating oil will also cost more this winter, natural gas plays a far bigger role for heating for most of us. Only about 8 million of the roughly 110 million U.S. households use heating oil to fire the furnace, with natural gas used in most of the rest.      

Natural gas costs have averaged about $6 per 1,000 cubic feet this year. (A cubic foot is 1,027 British thermal units; one Btu is the amount of natural gas needed to heat one pound of water by one degree.)      

This is $2 to $3 higher than historical averages, as demand has soared.      

As a result, 2004 could be the winter when higher fuel costs prompt many Americans to overcome inertia and replace aged windows, doors and furnace components, said Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a Washington-based non-profit organization.      

People are paying attention to higher costs, Callahan said. "If your bills go up by 20, 25 percent for a couple of months, you'd consider it."      

Some tips to lower your energy bills:      

If your house is drafty, you're essentially heating the outdoors. Seal crevices. Use weather stripping between doors and frames, caulking between the window frames and wall.      

If you need new windows, look for those with the government's Energy Star label. The alliance estimates that such windows -- featuring double panes and coatings -- can cut heating bills by 34 percent.      

A furnace in good working condition also lowers bills. Make sure yours is cleaned and working properly before cold weather arrives and technicians are scrambling on emergencies.      

Insulation is another crucial weapon in battling house leaks and the subsequent higher energy bills.      

Experts estimate that more than 60 percent of American homes are underinsulated, based on current residential building standards, according to the North American Insulation Manufacturers Association, citing a 2003 study by Harvard University's School of Public Health.      

Insulation in your attic, crawl spaces, walls and ceilings will make your home warmer in winter and cooler in summer. But, if you already have some insulation, there's no need to remove the old before adding the new, according to the North American Insulation Manufacturers Association.      

Another easy tip? Keep blinds and drapes open when you leave the house this winter, allowing sunlight in during the day to warm the place (there's a reason cats and dogs look to recline in the sun).      

With energy demand soaring in the developing world, it's unlikely that prices will fall. Taking prudent measures to become an efficient consumer is the surest way to spend less money on heat this winter.

Australia's Alumina 1H Net A$168M, Up 41%

MELBOURNE (Dow Jones)--Australian mining company Alumina Ltd. (AWC.AU) on Thursday reported a 41% jump in net profit to A$168 million for the six months ended June 30.    

That compares with a net profit of A$117.9 million in the same period a year ago.    

Alumina declared an interim dividend of 10 cents a share.    

Alcoa World Alumina & Chemical, in which Alumina has a 40% stake, is considering expanding its international operations by more than 4 million tons. A decision on the first stage of expansion is due at the end of the year, Alumina said in a statement. [ 28-07-04 2335GMT ]    

SYDNEY (Dow Jones)--Australian mining company Alumina Ltd. (AWC.AU) Thursday reported a 41% jump in net profit to A$168 million for the six months ended June 30.    

That compares with a net profit of A$117.9 million in the same period a year ago.    

Alumina declared a steady interim dividend of 10 cents a share.    

The company said its Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals joint venture with Alcoa Inc. (AA) is considering expanding its global alumina refining network by more than four million metric tons.    

A decision on the first stage of expansion in due at the end of the year, Alumina said in a statement. Alumina has 40% of AWAC, which is managed by Alcoa. [ 28-07-04 2339GMT ]    

The expansion will take place at AWAC's existing refineries, which provided additional alumina production at low capital costs and favorable operating costs, Alumina chief executive John Marlay said.    

"Expansions will be underpinned by long term supply contracts to AWAC customers," he said.    

Marlay said the group is in a strong financial position to fund the expansion.    

"We have the financial strength to fund this growth, maintain conservative financial rations and pay a reasonable level of dividends to our shareholders," he added.    

Alumina has a "sound balance sheet, an A-rating from Standard & Poor's and net debt of A$218 million as of June 30, Marlay said.    

Alumina attributed the strong first half result to higher prices and increased AWAC production of alumina, which was offset by higher Australian dollar exchange rates.    

AWAC profit excluding gains from the Specialty Chemical divestment jumped 29% to A$153 million in the six months ending June 30.    

Marlay said it is "an excellent result in the face of a higher Australian dollar."    

"AWAC has a pipeline of organic growth projects, which can deliver solid growth at a relatively low capital cost," Marlay said in a statement. [ 28-07-04 2352GMT ]

Fording Cdn Coal Sees Increase In 2Q Transportation Costs

TORONTO (Dow Jones)--The movement of metallurgical coal from the Elk Valley mines in southeastern British Columbia won't be disrupted by a dispute with Canadian Pacific Railway Co. (CP), officials at Fording Canadian Coal Trust (FDG) said Tuesday.    

"Current rail service is meeting our needs," Fording president Jim Popowich said on a quarterly earnings call.    

Fording and Teck Cominco Ltd. (TEK.B.T) own the Elk Valley Coal Partnership, the world's second-largest producer of metallurgical coal. Canadian Pacific filed a statement of claim against Elk Valley Coal Partnership earlier this month that alleges the partnership failed to pay the full amount of rail freight charges stipulated in its contract.    

The contract runs to March 31, 2007.    

Canadian Pacific declined to comment on the dispute, citing the litigation. Elk Valley is the railroad's largest customer.    

Popowich said Elk Valley would continue to pay the previous freight rates to Canadian Pacific until the dispute is settled, but had expensed the C$14.2 million in disputed payments in the second quarter.    

That expense helped push Fording's second-quarter transportation costs to C$119 million, up 32% from the year-ago period. Also contributing to the increase was a higher proportion of contracts in which Fording was responsible for ocean freight charges.    

Rail represents about 35% of Elk Valley's total transportation costs.    

Late Monday, Fording reported net earnings of C$13 million or 26 Canadian cents a share in the second quarter, including an after-tax charge of C$28 million related to the reduction in its interest in the Elk Valley Coal Partnership to 60%.    

In the second quarter of 2003, net income totaled C$39 million or 84 Canadian cents a share, including C$24 million in tax gains.    

Revenues in the second quarter rose 24% to C$308 million on the back of strong demand for coal.    

Popowich said he believes Elk Valley can increase its annual sales to 30 million metric tons or more over a five-year period. The company now produces around 25 million metric tons a year.    

"The challenge is that the market can support those levels and that rail service is there," he said. The company believes that a substantial increase in coal sales out of Elk Valley may require capacity additions.    

Ports and railways are being "pressed to meet demand," Popowich said.    

The company has sold all of its 2004 coal production and its mines "are running flat out," Popowich said. He added that the market "looks strong" for 2005.

SUPER FUND UP $174M SINCE START

Taxpayers' New Zealand Superannuation Fund has made $174 million on investment income since starting late last year, and is now worth $3.7 billion.    

About $6.3b would be sitting in the fund by mid-2005, Finance Minister Dr Michael Cullen said. The Government would put about $2.1b into the fund in the next financial year.    

But Cullen says even by 2040 the fund would only be big enough to pay for a third of the current cost of superannuation. NZ Super is forecast to cost about $5.9b in the June year just ended, Budget figures show.    

"The fund is not an attempt to fully fund the future cost of NZ Superannuation," he told a Labour Party meeting in Whakatane yesterday. "The fund was mainly a way of ensuring future governments could pay for a basic universal retirement income without facing `impossible choices'."    

Those choices were to either "increase taxes, increase debt or tamper with the elderly's entitlements and conditions," Cullen said.    

The National Party has not said what it would do with the fund, but says it will decide its superannuation fund policy well before next year's election. Cullen said recently National would use the money in the fund to pay for tax cuts or roads.    

"Those who oppose the fund and advocate it be wound up and its assets used for current consumption have to be explicit about what they would put in its place," Cullen said yesterday. They would have to say what level of tax increase they would be happy to impose on future taxpayers or what degree of cuts to super entitlements they are willing to contemplate.    

By getting debt down now, and putting money into the fund, government finances were on a "firm footing".    

Including fund assets, net government debt would be down to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product by the end of June. By 2008, the Super Fund is forecast by Treasury to be worth almost $15.5b.    

The fund's $174m investment income was equal to a 6.04% return since it started at the end of September -- beating the benchmark return from 90-day Treasury bills of 3.47% for the same period.    

The fund beat this "risk-free rate of return" by 2.57% in the eight months. That was slightly better than its target of beating the rate by at least 2.5% a year over 20 years.    

About $450m of the fund is invested in New Zealand shares, mainly through AMP Capital Investors and Brook Asset Management with about $140m each.    

Not surprisingly, the biggest investment is with market leader Telecom, with shares worth $56m, followed by Contact Energy, Carter Holt and Fletcher Building.    

But the lion's share of more than $2.1b is in international shares, with a strong leaning to banks -- including Citigroup, Bank of America, J. P. Morgan Chase and UBS.    

Don't bank on housing -- B12 Kiwis fail on super schemes -- B12

Q I AM thinking of buying an investment townhouse in Queensland using the equity in my home as security.    

I've been told that by doing this that at the end of the financial year there will be tax credits and this money will go towards paying off the home loan, so long as the government does not change the rules relating to property investment.    

Do you see any problems in doing this and are there pitfalls we should look at?    

N.S.,    

Glen Iris    

A THERE are risks. While negative gearing works well in a rising market, the property market has been strong for a long time and a correction in prices is under way.    

Any fall in the value of your purchase would see your equity eroded because the borrowed funds remain the same. Another risk is the lack of tenants, as rents are falling and vacancies rising around Australia because of excessive building.    

This would affect your ability to fund the interest. The wrong type of tenants can destroy a property, which is also a risk. A change of the tax rules is also a risk, but perhaps that is the least of the worries.    

Q I HAVE accumulated some small share holdings via some picks that went wrong, and companies splitting up operations, for example PaperlinX.    

Is there any point in maintaining these small shareholdings or should I clean them out?    

S.T.    

Ocean Grove    

A FOR portfolio efficiency, there normally isn't any point holding on to small shareholdings.    

If the investment constitutes less than 2 per cent of your total portfolio, even if you received huge growth, then typically this will have little impact on your total return.    

It also means you avoid the need to keep detailed records for a lot of inconsequential holdings for tax purposes.    

As an alternative, you could add to anything your analysis suggests is worthwhile holding on to for the long term, and bring it up to a more reasonably sized holding.    

Q SHOULD I take part in dividend reinvestment plans, where my future dividends are converted to more shares rather than being paid out as cash?    

P.L.    

Nunawading    

A THESE plans have merit as the investor sometimes gets shares at a discount and/or enables you to take advantage of dollar cost averaging.    

But there are other issues that need to be considered -- most importantly why you were investing in the shares in the first place. If the objective was for regular income, then reinvesting any of your dividends will mean loss of that income.    

Reinvesting also creates additional administrative and taxation hassles. Each new batch of shares must be recorded for capital gains tax purposes, at the cost price, adding complications when they are sold. Finally, as the shares accumulate, the money tied up in the one investment may begin to exceed a prudent level.    

Taking cash distributions is an objective profit taking mechanism to ensure your exposure does not become excessive.

Planner: Turn portfolio to more conservative path ; Without a secure job, it's important to tone down risk

Stacy Kopper has done two things very well, says Janet Briaud, a financial planner in Bryan, Texas. 

"She has developed a really nice portfolio for her age and kept her spending way down in this uncertain time," Briaud says. 

The main thing Kopper needs to do, she says, is tone down the risk in her portfolio. "If you don't have a secure job, then you want your portfolio to be more secure and safe." 

Given that Kopper plans to continue working into retirement age, as long as her investment assets grow a little bit, she doesn't need to take a lot of risk. Another reason to err on the side of caution is that stock valuations are high now. 

"It's just a time for Stacy especially to be pretty conservative," Briaud says. 

To accomplish that, Briaud suggests that Kopper: 

* Invest the IRA accounts in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). "They are very safe and secure investments that I think are underutilized," Briaud says. "They are tax inefficient, so you want them in a retirement account." 

* Divide the roughly 30% of her assets now in the non-retirement portfolio among three mutual funds. Because the market is overvalued, Briaud recommends a mix of value-oriented funds and funds with a hedging strategy to help protect against volatility. 

Specifically, she recommends a small-cap value fund, such as Oakmark Small Cap, and an international value fund, such as Tweedy Browne Global Value or Longleaf Partners International. 

Briaud's third stock fund recommendation is Hussman Strategic Growth, which invests in U.S. stocks with the goal of preserving capital during unfavorable market conditions. 

* Maintain her current cash position. "She's got about 20% in cash, and I think that's appropriate," Briaud says. 

* Put about 20% of her portfolio in a laddered portfolio of short- term Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from one to three years. That money could later be used for a down payment on a home. 

* Invest another 10% in an international bond fund, such as Pimco Global. "I think eventually the dollar will come down, and another 10% in an international bond fund would help in that environment," she says. 

Kopper should focus on getting the job she wants and making her portfolio more conservative. Once she's done those two things, she can begin to think about buying a home. 

For the moment, she is lucky not to own a home, Briaud says. Home prices are high, and not owning a home gives her more flexibility in her job hunt. 

The fact that Kopper's expenses are low and she has accumulated sizable savings gives her unusual freedom to make major changes. "Her biggest asset is ability to earn," Briaud says.

PERTH (Dow Jones)--Portman Ltd. (PMM.AU) said Monday that it hasn't had any approaches from Hong Kong's Mega Harvest Resources, despite media speculation that the iron ore miner is in the sights of Hong Kong businessman Lee Ming Tee.    

"There have been no discussions and no approaches at this point," Portman Managing Director Barry Eldridge told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.    

His comments follows confirmation earlier Monday that Mega Harvest Resources Ltd. has increased its stake in Portman to 7.48% from 6.65%.    

Eldridge said that he does not know whether Lee Ming Tee is associated with Mega Harvest, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.    

"We're in the process of trying to determine who the beneficial owners of Mega Harvest are and hopefully we'll get that in the next day or so," Eldridge said. [ 10-05-04 0451GMT ]    

Portman hasn't appointed a corporate adviser, but is "looking at our options", Eldridge added.    

A takeover offer from Mega Harvest is "one possibility", although Portman is not ruling out that the company may be a "passive investor", he said.    

"I don't know what their intentions are as I haven't spoken to them," he added.    

An Australian newspaper report Monday said interests associated with Lee Ming Tee are planning a takeover move after becoming Portman's biggest stakeholder through recent share purchases.    

Shares in Portman have risen by around 13% since mid-April, in defiance of downward pressure on mining shares caused by fears of an economic slowdown in China.    

Portman is currently ramping up an expansion of its Koolyanobbing mine in Western Australia following long delays due to environmental restrictions.    

The company is Australia's third biggest iron ore producer, but is much smaller than industry heavyweights Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP).    

Portman sells around three quarters of its annual production in China and expects to produce more than five million metric tons of iron ore in 2004.    

Late last month, Eldridge said he was comfortable the company will meet market profit forecasts for 2004.    

Predictions from analysts are broadly between A$26 million and A$30 million, he noted. "I'm comfortable with that range," he said.    

Portman's marketing office in Beijing doesn't expect efforts in China to slow the local economy to have "any impact on the demand for our iron ore," he added at the time.    

At about 0500 GMT, Portman's shares were up two cents at A$1.63, off its intraday high of A$1.65. The company has a market capitalization of about A$280 million.    

The substantial shareholder notice filed by Mega Harvest Resources said it now owned 12.82 million Portman shares, up from 11.40 million shares when the last notice was filed.

        WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Harsco Corp. (HSC) currently has about 36,600 
asbestos personal injury claims pending, according to its quarterly report 
filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
        Included in the total, 26,650 cases were pending in the New York 
Supreme Court for various counties in New York state, and 9,350 cases were 
pending in state courts of various counties in Mississippi, the filing said. 
        The remaining claims are filed in various counties in several state 
courts and in U.S. Federal District Court for the Eastern District of 
Pennsylvania, the filing said. Those complaints assert lesser amounts of 
damages than the New York cases, or they don't state any amount claimed, 
according to the filing. 
        As of March 31, Harsco said, the company had obtained summary 
judgment before trial or dismissal by stipulation in all cases that proceeded 
to trial. 
        In addition, the company reached agreement with one plaintiff's 
counsel in Mississippi to dismiss it from 2,900 cases in that state, the 
filing said. Harso said it is awaiting entry by the Mississippi courts of the 
appropriate orders of dismissal of those cases. 
        As reported, the court in New York County in December 2002 issued an 
order creating a "deferred docket" for all pending and future asbestos claims 
of plaintiffs that don't meet minimum criteria for discernible physical 
impairment and an "active docket" for plaintiffs that are able to show such 
medical conditions. 
        Harsco said the court made significant progress toward finalizing the 
deferred docket for 1997 and 1998 cases. 
        As of March 31, the court has designated a total of 460 cases to the 
active docket and assigned to trial groups scheduled for trial for the period 
of February 2004 through February 2005, with the company named in only 164 of 
those cases, the filing said. 
        Harsco also said that it was dismissed from all 14 cases that it was 
named in the February 2004 trial group and is working to obtain dismissals 
for all 28 of the cases that it was named in the May 2004 trial group. 
        The company said the lawsuits filed in the state courts of 
counties in Mississippi were filed in the fourth quarter of 2002 before the 
more restrictive "deferred docket" legislation took effect. 
         Also in the filing, Harsco said it expects to contribute a total of 
about $19.8 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2004, down from 
its original estimate of $24 million. 
        In the first quarter ended March 31, the company said it contributed 
$200,000 to its U.S. plans and $4.1 million to its international plans. 
        Harsco currently anticipates contributing an additional $1.2 million 
for its U.S. plans and $14.3 million for international plans during the 
remainder of 2004, the filing said. 
        Harsco is an industrial service and products company.

Mail Money - MONEY BOX.

Lesley Collins, head of Independent Women Financial Advisers in Edinburgh and Glasgow, answers your queries    

IAM in my early thirties and have never been good with money. My friends all have their own flats and seem to save each month. I don't have any real debt but seem to live from month to month. How can I get my finances in order?    

MAKE an appointment with an IFA ask your friends to recommend someone or there are details on the internet of many in your area. Ask if they can help you complete a monthly income and expenditure plan and assess how you spend on basics each month and how much you can save, for short, medium and long term goals. MY husband and I are in the final stages of divorce. I have agreed to a lump sum of £40,000. As I have brought up our children, I've never paid into a pension. Is it too late to start? I don't actually need the money and I am aged 44.    

IT depends on whether you are working and your income. If your total earnings are under £30,000, then you can pay £2808 net each year to your own stakeholder pension plan. As you get older, the amount you can pay may increase and you should ask your adviser to calculate the maximum each year. Until then, I would suggest you pay the £2808 now, also maximise your ISA allowance and with the remainder consider an investment that will allow you to withdraw £2808 each year to fund pension contributions. IAM due to get ill health retirement next month on a pension of £12,000 each year and lump sum of £35,000. I have an endowment mortgage of £12,000 with eight years to run. My policy appears to be on target to repay the loan but should I use my lump sum to pay off my mortgage? I could also overpay £150 to my mortgage each month. My husband earns a good salary but his pension will be lower when he retires in seven years.    

I WOULD suggest you keep paying your mortgage and as your endowment is on target I see no reason to stop this now. If you can save £150 maybe an ISA would be better. This way, you will accrue a further lump sum which could be used once your husband stops work. You should also invest your lump sum wisely so you still have your capital to fall back on. IHAVE been with the same mortgage lender for almost 10 years. A lot of my friends seem to remortgage all the time. Can I do this without incurring a lot of extra cost? nIF you are not tied to your current lender you can remortgage without penalty. Shop around for the lender who offers the best rate and this will save you on monthly repayments. Some firms also offer to pay legal and valuation costs.

Street Smart: Economy Watch -- Inflation Is Worse Than You Thought --- If the CPI does not reflect the true cost of living, your retirement plans could suffer

ECONOMISTS watch the consumer price index very carefully. And when it's released in the middle of each month, the response is nearly universal - they tell you it's wrong.    

Foremost among the complaints: The CPI doesn't accurately measure how inflation hits the Average Joe. Many economists believe it sometimes lowballs inflation, which can reduce your comfort level in retirement.    

In calculating CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at changes in the price of consumer goods and services. The bureau tracks thousands of prices, from the cost of a doctor's visit to the price of houses and cars. But critics say the measure misses some quickly climbing costs, such as health care premiums and property taxes. That might explain why CPI was up 2.3 percent in 2003 but real life felt more expensive.    

Where does the measure come off the tracks? First off, when figuring changes in housing costs, the bureau, oddly enough, doesn't use real estate prices. Instead, it calculates the value of a house based on what it would cost to rent. "Housing has really mucked it up," says Dan Fuss, manager of the top-performing Loomis Sayles Bond fund. "When you look at real estate ads, you see the housing prices going way up, but the rental costs are not. It's a distorted view."    

Another snag: The index is tweaked to account for product improvements, which offset rising prices. So while the cost of a car increases, the difference might be revised downward if the car now has airbags and a navigation system. But if you can't buy a car without airbags, it's still a rising cost. Plus, there are no revisions for deteriorating services. Have to wait hours in the doctor's office, despite rising health care costs? Too bad.    

There are advantages to the government that result from keeping CPI low: Increases in Social Security benefits are linked to the index, so increases are lower (and pensioners are poorer). Additionally, it allows the Federal Reserve to keep rates low, making it easier for the government and consumers to manage debt. "We wonder if things haven't gone overboard to keep the federal debt down and the deficit down and the cost of debt down," says Jim Floyd, a senior analyst with The Leuthold Group.    

A lowball CPI is bad news if you own Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. TIPS have been popular in recent years as insurance against rising inflation because the yield is pegged to the CPI. But if the increases lag the real cost of living, retirees can't rely on the yield to pay for ever-more-costly staples. So what can you do about it? There's no easy answer. Save more, spend less, and when that CPI number is released, take it with a grain of salt.

Teachers blasts Caisse loophole

The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board said Monday that the exclusion of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec from Ottawa's recently proposed cap on pension funds' ability to invest in business trusts is "unfair and discriminatory."    

Thanks to a tax-based loophole, Caisse - the largest pension fund manager in Canada with about $140-billion in assets - and the Quebec pension plans managed by it, are not subject to the investment limits announced by the federal government in the March budget. Pension funds can only place 1 per cent of their assets into a business income trust, and own no more than 5 per cent of any one trust.    

Lee Fullerton, spokeswoman for the Teachers pension plan, Canada's second-largest pension fund, said that the proposed rules will put them at a competitive disadvantage by "severely limiting our ability to make money for teachers. Caisse does not have that restriction placed on them."    

The new rules from Ottawa will have a significant impact on Teacher's holdings, which are above the newly-permitted limit, and will prevent the pension fund from fully participating in events such as income trust IPO's, Ms. Fullerton said.    

"We will be eliminated from many markets," she said. If this legislation goes through, Caisse and other pooled investments will have a "tremendous competitive advantage competing for investments with all other Canadian pension plans."    

Teachers said it is talking with other pension plans to make sure they are aware of the inequality. It said it has also voiced its objections to the federal and provincial governments.    

The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board (OMERS) told globeandmail.com last week that Caisse's exemption is "unfair" and said it is also discussing the issue with other pension plans.    

The Caisse did not immediately return phone calls Monday.    

Harry Adams, a spokesman for the federal government's Finance Department, said the Caisse is an "agent of the Crown" in Quebec, which makes it exempt from taxation and as wells as the proposed restrictions.    

The only way the Caisse could be forced to comply with the new rules would be if the province of Quebec "decided it wanted to do so itself," Mr. Adams said.    

Income trusts, quickly approaching $90-billion in market capitalization, have become increasingly popular because of the steady stream of income they pay to investors and the advantages provided by their largely tax-free structure.    

"The proposed legislation is discriminatory against teachers and other members of Canadian pension plans," Ms. Fullerton said. Teachers, which invests $75-billion to cover pensions for 248,000 current and retired teachers, is an active player in the income trust sector.    

The Caisse manages assets for more than 20 Quebec insurance and pension funds, including the Quebec Pension Plan and the Quebec Automobile Insurance Society. By exempting the Caisse from restrictions placed on the rest of Canada's pension funds, it allows billions of dollars to fall outside of the new rules.

Salt Lake-based vSpring Capital last week unveiled the inaugural v|100, a peer-selected community of elite entrepreneurs based in Utah (or with significant ties to the state) deemed most likely to play an active role in building and growing successful technology or biotechnology companies in the next five to seven years.    

Officially known as the vSpring Capital Top 100 Venture Entrepreneurs, the v|100 was conceived by vSpring as a tool to recognize the region's outstanding entrepreneurs and to support and promote collaborative partnering and mentoring among top entrepreneurs in the region. Although vSpring took initial steps to organize the v|100, the ongoing direction of the community will be determined by its members, as they have the opportunity to share their insights and opinions in shaping this unique community.    

Organization of the v|100, began in late 2003 when leading members of the Utah business community were asked by vSpring to nominate the top 100 venture entrepreneurs based upon the following criteria:    

* Individuals most likely to lead a successful venture in the next five to seven years in the information technology or biotech industries;    

* Individuals who could be the CEO/CTO of a new venture; and    

* Individuals with ties to the region (but not required to be Utah residents).    

Entrepreneurs nominated then were contacted by vSpring and asked to participate in a confidential online survey to vote for the top 10 individuals each nominee felt would be the most likely to meet the same criteria, with the final tally generating the v|100.    

Based on initial discussions with selected members of the v|100, vSpring has decided to build a private Web community accessible only to the v|100, that will allow and foster individual and group dialog between members and vSpring partners. Additionally, the v|100, will be invited to participate in a vSpringsponsored recognition lunch and golf tournament designed to kick off the group's inauguration and to further promote collaboration among v|100, members. They will also be invited to participate in ongoing, executive-level roundtables and will continue to help identify and recognize Utah's often overlooked populous of successful executives and managers.    

Not surprisingly, more than 90 percent of the members of the inaugural v|100, live in Utah. Additionally, these individuals have raised more than $1.8 billion in capital and formed companies leading to the creation of more than 7,000 jobs. The vast majority (more than 70 percent) has founded Utah-based businesses during the past 10 years.    

A complete list of the v|100, can be found at    www.vspring.com.    

vSpring is an early-stage venture capital fund focusing on investment opportunities in information technology and life sciences. vSpring capitalizes on the managerial skills and operating experience of its principals to successfully invest in and mentor early-stage companies. vSpring has offices in Salt Lake City and Los Alamos, N.M.

        As reported, the maker of chemical specialties said 2004 capital 
expenditures are seen at $65 million to $70 million. 
 
        In the 10-K from late Monday, Hercules said capital expenditures are 
expected to be about $60 million in the years 2006 through 2008. 
 
   

[ 03-16-04 0859ET ]  


 
 
        According to the 10-K, Hercules projects asbestos settlement payments 
of $40 million to $45 million in 2004 before consideration of any insurance 
coverage or reimbursement. 
 
        Net of insurance, Hercules spent $40 million during 2003, the filing 
said. 
 
        Hercules said it expects severance payments of $10 million in 2004. 
Restructuring and severance payments were $21 million in 2003 versus $39 
million in 2002, according to the 10-K. 
 
        Hercules also said it expects remaining tax payments from its 
BetzDearborn divestiture to be between $11 million and $21 million, and 
expects to pay them in 2005. 
 
        In April 2002, Hercules completed the sale of its BetzDearborn water 
treatment business for $1.8 billion in cash, resulting in net after-tax 
proceeds of $1.7 billion.

benefits pensions plans in 2003. 
 
        Hercules said the projected increase in pension expense in 2004, 2005

Commission flexibility via Standard platform mutual funds

up to 5% initial commission available via mutual's third-party fund platform sigma    

Standard Life is to offer front-end intermediary commission of up to 5% on the investment funds it sells through its mutual funds platform, Sigma.    

Intermediaries are also expected to be offered a choice of commission when selecting funds from the service, such as a higher initial commission and lower trail or vice versa. The average level of initial commission on offer will be 3%.    

Standard Life is looking to put what it terms "competitive with the market" charges on its mutual funds platform, likely to be 5% upfront and 1.5% annual. These charges will be split three ways, between the mutual, fund manager and intermediary. The lower the amount taken by the fund manager, the greater the amount of commission available.    

Assuming Standard Life takes 0.5% on a 1.5% annual fee, a fund group taking 0.3% per year leaves scope for an intermediary to take trail of 0.7%. Groups have not had to price all their funds at the same level. For instance, bond funds are likely to feature higher commission and lower fees to the manager.    

While the lowest annual fee being taken by a group is 0.3% and the highest 1%, the amounts groups take on the front end vary. Some groups have also signed up to agreements where their annual charges will decline once assets gathered through the Sigma platform pass set points.    

Standard Life is looking at offering packaged Isas, made up of several underlying funds, as part of its proposition.    

By combining funds with comparatively high total charges with those that have comparatively low ones, it hopes to create packages with industry standard fees and commission.    

In addition, it would allow some of the groups that signed up their funds at a lower price to potentially gather in more assets through the packaged Isa route.    

Most groups signed up at the same level for the funds platform, which launches in April, as for Standard's forthcoming pensions platform of third-party and in-house fund links.    

Standard Life is pricing the funds on the pensions side at a base of 1% with no initial charge and external providers place their charges above the 1% limit. For example, Standard Life Investments' funds are available through the pensions platform at 1%, while Baillie Gifford funds are on offer at 1.3% and Fidelity's at 2%.    

Funds from Schroders, Jupiter and Liontrust are featured at 1.8%, while Invesco Perpetual portfolios are priced at 1.72% and those from Gartmore at 1.75%. Charges on the mutual fund side have yet to be revealed but Standard Life said it has not adopted a different approach for mutual funds and pensions.    

Because much of Standard Life's distribution in the past has focused on with-profits, it plans a major marketing and education push to intermediaries on its new proposition.

International Steel Posted Net Of $24.9 Million for 4th Quarter

International Steel Group Inc., in its first quarter as a public company, reported higher than expected fourth-quarter earnings and appears poised to make steel cheaper than nearly everyone else in the U.S., showing that its experiment of buying bankrupt steelmakers, cutting retiree health-care costs and trimming management ranks is beginning to pay off.

The company, based in Richfield, Ohio, reported a fourth-quarter net income of $24.9 million, or 28 cents a share, on sales of $1.42 billion. The company shipped 3.5 million tons of steel in the period. Analysts were expecting income of less than 18 cents a share. The company, having made an initial public offering in December, wasn't in existence for the full year of 2002 and doesn't have comparison information available for 2002.

Founded in 2002 by a New York financier, Wilbur L. Ross, ISG was created at a low point in the domestic steel industry to acquire the assets of LTV Corp., Bethlehem Steel, and Acme Metals. It most recently struck an agreement to obtain the assets of West Virginia-based Weirton Steel Corp., pending approval from a bankruptcy court. With each acquisition, the company has been able to negotiate better labor contracts with workers that allowed it to trim legacy costs, which consist largely of retiree health care and pensions, make needed work-force reductions and improve efficiency. New York-based steel analyst Chuck Bradford of Bradford Research/Soleil said it appears the company now requires 1.7 man hours per ton of steel produced, a drastic improvement from earlier production figures at the companies ISG acquired.

ISG said the first quarter looks strong in large part because of industrywide pricing power, due to high demand and tight supply of steel. Fourteen blast furnaces have shut down in the past three years, and 40 steelmakers have filed for bankruptcy-court protection in the period. Similar to its competitors, the company raised prices once this quarter, citing a shortage of raw materials used to make steel such as coke-ash, and has added two surcharges in the first quarter, taking hot band prices up from $400 per ton in early January to $510 per ton for orders going into the second quarter. The company said 60% of its shipments in the second half of 2004 will be on contract business, with 40% from the spot market.

For 2003, ISG lost $23.5 million, or 31 cents a share, mainly related to $70.3 million in expenses related to the acquisition of Bethlehem, on shipments of 10.4 million tons. Chief Executive Rodney Mott said production and shipments grew in the fourth quarter, which boosted revenue 20% over the third quarter.

The company can cast more than 18 million tons of steel a year now at facilities in six states making it second to Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel Corp. for global steelmaking capacity by integrated domestic companies.

Edited Press Release    

OSLO (Dow Jones)--Guinor Gold Corporation, currently a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kenor ASA (KEN.OS), said Friday it will make an offer to acquire all Kenor shares on a one-for-one basis.    

Guinor Gold Corporation, a company registered by Kenor in Yukon Territory, Canada, has been created for the initial purpose of, effectively, re-domiciling Kenor in Canada, and to secure a listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange.    

Guinor Gold Corporation will continue to pursue Kenor's business model from planned headquarters in London, U.K.    

Guinor Gold Corporation will seek to obtain a principal listing of its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange, a market known for its listings of natural resources and mining companies, with a secondary listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange.    

A planned listing in Toronto will facilitate access by the company to the active capital and equity markets in Canada and is intended to improve Kenor's ability to raise capital in the future.    

The share exchange offer will be made in form of an offer document distributed to all Kenor shareholders with known addresses in jurisdictions where such distribution is legal. The process and the background for the re-organization will be thoroughly described in such document.    

The offer price will be one Guinor Gold Corporation common share for each Kenor share. Kenor shareholders holding less than 2,000 Kenor shares may at their own discretion elect to receive a cash settlement for their Kenor shares, or one Guinor Gold Corporation common share for each Kenor share. The cash settlement offer will be NOK 5.60 per Kenor share.    

The Kenor Board believes that the terms of the Exchange Offer are in the best interest of the Kenor Shareholders as a whole, and unanimously recommends all Kenor Shareholders to accept the Exchange Offer.    

The obligation of Guinor Gold Corporation to complete the Exchange Offer is subject to the satisfaction, or the waiver by Guinor Gold Corporation, of all of the following Conditions: that the number of Kenor shares that are validly tendered to Guinor Gold Corporation in respect of the exchange offer represents more than 90% of the fully diluted share capital of Kenor assuming the exercise of all rights to acquire shares; that Guinor Gold Corporation has been conditionally approved for listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange on terms and conditions which are satisfactory to Guinor Gold Corporation; and that financing of the acquisition of Kenor has been finally obtained on such terms and conditions which are satisfactory to Guinor Gold Corporation.    

Management of Kenor have indicated that after extensive study they believe the proposed Exchange Offer is in the best interest of shareholders and that they intend to accept the Offer for shares owned by themselves.    

Guinor does currently not own any shares in Kenor.    

In aggregate the pre-acceptances relate to 13,924,247 million shares in Kenor, representing approximately 10% of the issued shares in Kenor. [ 27-02-04 1402GMT ]

Your money queries answered by Peter Rutherford, chief executive of Rutherford Wilkinson plc, independent financial advisors.    

Mr and Mrs PG from Wylam write:    

Since the early 1990s my wife and I have put lump sum investments into growth bonds with various companies. Some of these have done well, some not so well. Most of the bonds on offer seem to be for five-year terms with penalties for early encashment. We would prefer something which gives us more flexibility. We want growth not income. Any advice would be appreciated.    

Answer:    

Many of the bonds about to be issued are for five-and-a-half-year terms and do offer some form of capital protection. AXA will launch a bond in February offering 100pc capital protection plus 77pc net growth in the FTSE 100 (equating to 96.25pc gross) over the term.    

For more flexibility Britannia International have launched the second issue of their Optimum Growth Bond which will give a return equal to 140pc of the FTSE growth, again over five-and-a-half years, but if after the-and-a-half years the market has risen by above 31pc the plan will mature early.    

I advise you to take detailed advice from an independent financial adviser before you make any commitment.

Mr RD from Wardley writes:    

I have approximately £14,000 tied up in ISAs. I'm not happy about the way they've performed and would like to move the money to another company. Can this be done?    

Answer:    

You can transfer current year subscriptions in whole and previous year's investments in whole or part to another ISA manager at any time.    

Investments transferred are not new subscriptions and all the tax benefits are preserved.    

***********    

Mr FW from Gosforth writes:    

I am aged 68 and in July of this year I will be moving to Florida to live with my son and daughter-in-law. I am in receipt of the state pension and I also receive £620 a month from a private pension. I pay income tax on the pension I receive but will I still have to pay income tax when I go to live in Florida?    

Answer:    

Both the pensions you receive are subject to UK tax but you will still be entitled to your personal allowance.    

I believe you will be liable for United States tax on your pension income but because of the Double Tax Treaty with the US you will be able to claim a credit against US tax liabilities on the tax you have already paid in the UK. This will all become clearer once you've made the move abroad.

Alcan Sees 2004 Primary Aluminum Deficit Of 170,000 Tons

VANCOUVER (Dow Jones)--Alcan Inc. (AL) said that, after three years of surpluses in the global primary-aluminum market, it projects a 170,000-metric-ton deficit for 2004.    

On a conference call, Alcan chief financial officer Geoffery Merszei said the company is projecting aluminum demand growth of 7.6%, and supply growth of 6.2% for the year.    

Montreal-based Alcan, the second-largest producer of aluminum after Alcoa Inc. (AA) and largest by revenue after swallowing French producer Pechiney SA, estimates that the 2003 global aluminum surplus was 155,000 metric tons, down from a 410,000-ton surplus in 2002.    

Aside from the bullish aluminum outlook, the company noted that London Metal Exchange aluminum prices have continued to gain in 2004, while the Canadian dollar has been weakening. This is a "much different pattern" from early 2003, and could lead to "significant upside potential" in earnings, Merszei said on the call.    

Executives didn't provide more specific guidance.    

As reported, higher metal prices drove Alcan's fourth-quarter net income to $143 million or 44 cents a share, up from net income of $26 million or 8 cents in the same 2002 period.    

For 2003, net earnings fell to $167 million or 50 cents a share from $374 million or $1.14 in 2002. Foreign-currency balance-sheet translations of items in Canadian and Australian dollars were largely responsible for the decline, the company said. Sales in 2003 rose to $13.6 billion from $12.3 billion the previous year.    

Results of Pechiney SA, which Alcan acquired late in 2003, aren't included in Alcan's fourth-quarter results, but Pechiney's assets and liabilities are included in its year-end balance sheet.    

Alcan chief executive Travis Engen said the company is halfway through a group-by-group analysis of projects and post-merger opportunities for synergies, and plans to present new synergy estimates for the Pechiney deal after the first quarter ends.    

Alcan is still assessing asset sales required by anti-trust officials in Europe and the U.S., Engen said.    

European competition authorities required Alcan to sell one of two sets of rolling-mill assets within one year of acquiring Pechiney. In the U.S., Alcan is supposed to sell Pechiney's Ravenswood facility in West Virginia within four months.    

But on Friday, state Gov. Bob Wise said West Virginia will challenge the federal requirement that Ravenswood be sold to preserve competition.    

Engen said notice of the state's court action "came as a surprise" and he doesn't have details, but he added that Alcan is focused on proceeding with the asset sales it committed to.    

Alcan makes primary aluminum, fabricated products and aluminum packaging.    

In New York Monday, Alcan shares are trading at $44.30, up 51 cents or 1.2%, on about 1.15 million shares.

Capital gains have tax pains

Q    

I was told the profit made on my investment unit after expenses and the 50 per cent discount would be taxed at 15 per cent. I retired in October 2003, having earned $10,666 that financial year. If I have made a profit on my investment unit of $200,000 and am taxed on a $100,000 capital gain, which rate will I be taxed at. Is it the same in each state?    

A    

The calculation of capital gains tax confuses many people. The net gain after adjustments is not taxed at any special rate but is added to your taxable income. If you earned $10,666 and had $100,000 of capital gains after allowing for the 50 per cent discount your taxable income for the year would be $110,666. If you had no other deductions, you would be liable for tax of $38,814. CGT is a Commonwealth tax and does not vary from state to state.    

Q    

Recently, you said capital gain for a house investment bought in 1993 and sold in 2003 was "a simple calculation". I am a retiree with no accountancy experience but I believed that inflation was also taken into account. For example, if inflation was 3 per cent for each of the 10 years the property was held, there would be a calculation based on the original price adjusted for inflation. The difference between the $125,000 and the inflation-adjusted purchase price would be the figure related to for capital gain . . . or, rather, half the difference since the property was held longer than 12 months?    

A    

You can use the inflation method for assets bought before September 21, 1999, when the rules changed, but the indexation figure was frozen as at September 1999 and you can claim inflation only until that date. Certainly it would pay to do the calculations but unless the asset was bought before 1990, you are usually better off to pay CGT on half of the un-indexed gain than all of the indexed gain. For example, if you bought an asset in January 1990 for $100,000 the indexed value as at September 1999 would be $122,299. If you sold it for $300,000 today you would pay CGT on a profit of $177,701 under the inflation method. Under the 50 per cent discount method, you would pay CGT on a profit of $100,000.    

Q    

My wife and I own half our house; our daughter, who pays no rent, owns the other half. We are thinking of giving her our half share. Since we are not going to make any profit, do we still have to pay any capital gains tax?    

A    

Even if you gift the property, the transfer will be deemed by the tax office to have been made at current market value. If the property has risen in value, capital gains tax will be payable. Talk to your accountant before you sign any documents.

Resolve to run a better business this year.

This is the first Francis Clark column of 2004, so we thought it would be an appropriate time to review some New Year's resolutions for businesses.    

We will make the most of tax breaks. If you run a small business, you are eligible for a number of tax breaks such as taper relief, choosing correctly between a dividend and a bonus, pension contributions paid through the company, the capital allowance for fixed assets such as air-conditioning, lifts and furniture, and tax incentives for being environmentally friendly. By making the best use of tax breaks, you could dramatically improve the profitability of your business in 2004.    

We will make sure our staff contracts are in order. January is often the time when staff contracts are renewed or updated, so now is the time to make sure that your staff contracts are in line with ever-changing UK and EU legislation. Many businesses are caught out by changes in the law, so get your staff contracts reviewed to make sure they are fair to all concerned and cover any HR issues that might arise.    

We will manage our time better. Take a close look at productivity within your business, and think carefully about how you and your colleagues use your time. You might even find that you become more productive using less time in the office! We will look at how we are structured. Many businesses which are not incorporated are that way through inertia. However, the Government has been encouraging more businesses to incorporate by offering tax breaks and other incentives. Incorporation could make your business more profitable in 2004, so get a professional to take a look and see if it suits you.    

We will file our returns on time. A small plea from hard-pressed accountants - please make sure we have everything we need to complete and lodge your tax returns on time! We have until January 31 to complete and submit returns for the year ending April 2003, but if there are problems or queries regarding calculations we need time to investigate them and make amendments where necessary.    

We will make the best use of our pensions. We all have to boost the contributions we make to our pensions to enjoy a comfortable retirement. Make use of incentives such as free stakeholder cash, free second pensions, shopping around for the best annuity rate and sidestepping the income limit.    

We will look into our eligibility for grants. Tens of thousands of pounds in grants go unclaimed by businesses in this country, and in a recent survey 90 per cent of small businesses said they could not be bothered to tangle with the red tape involved. But there is some £4 billion of grant money available each year, so get the best professional advice and see if your business is eligible.

Judge Grants Indefinite Delay For Weirton Bankruptcy Plan

MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP)--A federal bankruptcy judge indefinitely postponed a confirmation hearing on Weirton Steel Corp.'s (WRTLQ) reorganization plan Monday after company officials said the pressure to win creditors' approval by Dec. 31 has subsided.    

Weirton Steel had an ambitious timetable, with a confirmation vote set for Dec. 16, because the federal Emergency Steel Loan Guarantee Program was set to expire at the end of the month.    

But in a joint statement Monday, Sen. Robert C. Byrd and Rep. Alan B. Mollohan, both D-W.Va., said a key House-Senate negotiating committee has recommended to Congress that the steel loan program be extended two more years. Though there is no guarantee, both are optimistic that legislation will pass.    

The loan board has tentatively agreed to guarantee 88 percent of a $145 million loan for Weirton Steel through Fleet Capital Corp. of Chicago. And since President Bush lifted tariffs on some imported steel last week, the survival of that program is more critical than ever, the legislators said.    

In U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wheeling, Weirton Steel attorney Mark Freedlander said the company has made significant progress but realized last week that "year-end emergence just plain and simply wasn't going to happen."    

Among other things, Weirton still needs a new labor contract with the 3,000-member Independent Steelworkers Union, he said. It's also still resolving disputes with several creditors.    

Now, failure to confirm a plan by Dec. 31 apparently "will not be fatal to Weirton's ability to emerge on a stand-alone basis," Freedlander's motion said.    

Additional time also will let Weirton continue to explore other alternatives, including a sale, he said.    

Judge L. Edward Friend said, "With the amount of time you had and the issues you had, it would have surprised a whole lot of people if you could have gotten them done by December."    

Also Monday, Weirton announced it's imposing a $25 per ton surcharge on all shipments because of what it called unprecedented increases in the raw materials costs, especially natural gas.    

The charge will apply to all products and customers, and will last from Dec. 15 to Jan. 31. The company will notify customers by Jan. 16 if it needs to continue the charges through February.    

Despite the lifting of tariffs, Weirton officials are not worried about competing against a new surge of imported steel.    

China has been consuming more steel than it can produce, so that market should continue to be attractive to foreign producers, spokesman Gregg Warren said.    

Improvements in both the U.S. economy and those of other nations also have increased the global demand for steel, Warren said, and other U.S. producers are still expected to raise prices in January.    

Weirton Steel, which employs about 3,425, filed for Chapter 11 protection in May after losing money for five years. Weirton is the nation's fifth-largest integrated steel producer and its No. 2 producer of tin.

Investors show ignorance about their investments

markets & analysis | Research shows 70% of uk investors fail to check their portfolios while 13% do not know what investments they own      

Research has shown that nearly 70% of UK private investors do not keep a regular eye on their investments, while one in eight do not even know what they are invested in.      

The research was carried out by NMG Research of 711 respondents from 2,000 interviews during October. Of those questioned only 30.5% said their investments were in "well-maintained portfolios that are kept under constant review." Jason Hollands, director of communications and strategy at Isis, who sponsored the survey, said: "Our simple findings serve to underline what a woeful position many of the UK's private investors are actually in today."      

About 13% of those questioned said they did not know what they were invested in and a third said were unsure of their investment approach to risk.      

For Isis, with its funds of funds range managed by Richard Philbin, one of the crucial questions was that more than 25% of those surveyed said their investments had nothing in common but seemed like a good idea at the time or were no longer sure they had the right mix in their portfolio.      

Hollands said: "This suggests that just over 70% of the UK's private investors really have no idea of either how well their investments are doing or even if they are still suited to their changing personal circumstances.      

"It suggests most investors would be better off investing products such as funds of funds which have an overall asset allocation strategy and where the portfolio is constantly maintained in a tax efficient environment."      

Academic research used by Paul Myners in his review of the UK investment industry, found 91.5% of returns were due to asset allocation between bonds and equities rather than individual stocks.      

Isis Asset Management is the fund management company created by the merger of Friends Ivory & Sime and Royal & SunAlliance Investments with £61.9bn in assets under management as at 30 September 2003.      

Meanwhile, Isis has announced that it has reached heads of agreement with JP Morgan in respect of a deal to outsource a number of its operational functions. The transaction will provide Isis with an operational platform that is scaleable to support its growth objectives in addition to providing a first class administration service for its clients.      

"We are already one of the UK's top ten asset managers," said Howard Carter, chief executive officer of Isis Asset Management, "but our strategic goal is to become one of the top five by 2007."      

Meanwhile, Sir David Kinloch, non-executive chairman of the company, intends to step down as a director of the company during 2004. Sir David first joined the board of Friends Ivory & Sime in September 1994. The company has appointed specialist consultants to identify suitable candidates to succeed Sir David and will make an announcement at the appropriate time.

Japan Joins Assault On U.S. Steel Tariffs --- Latest Retaliation Threat Targets Gas and Clothing; Bush May Back Down Soon

TOKYO -- Japan threatened to impose retaliatory duties on a range of American products, from steel to gasoline and clothing, unless the U.S. drops tariffs on foreign steel imports that the World Trade Organization says are illegal.    

By Japan's tally, the duties on about a dozen categories of products would add $85 million a year to the price of American goods exported to Japan.    

Japan's move was the latest in a series of threatened retaliatory strikes against the U.S. following a recent ruling by the WTO that tariffs imposed more than a year ago by the Bush administration on imported steel violated global trade rules. So far, the Bush administration has given no indication that it plans to drop its steel tariffs, which are scheduled to run until early 2005. Many industry representatives on both sides of the debate, however, expect President George W. Bush to announce as early as Friday that he will eliminate the tariffs.    

The European Union already has threatened to impose duties of as much as 30% on more than $2 billion in U.S. exports, from clothing and orange juice to motor boats and sunglasses. And on Wednesday, an official at South Korea's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade said Seoul is also considering retaliatory measures on American products if the U.S. doesn't scrap its tariffs. However, the official declined to say what products South Korea might target.    

Japan reported to the WTO on Wednesday the list of U.S. products it will target. According to WTO rules, Japan will be able to enact the duties within 30 days, but it probably wouldn't if the U.S. drops the tariffs, according to an official at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    

"The Japanese government strongly expects that the United States will immediately withdraw measures that violate the WTO rules," said the official.    

The proposed duties include tariffs of 30% on U.S. steel and steel products, gasoline, gold and some plastic products. Japan also plans to impose tariffs of 5% on U.S. clothing, leather products, prefabricated houses and other goods, according to documents provided by a finance ministry official. In all, some 58 billion yen ($527 million) worth of U.S. exports to Japan would be subject to new tariffs.    

The WTO case was brought by the EU and seven nations after President Bush imposed the "safeguard" tariffs on steel imports in March 2002 to help protect U.S. steel makers while they restructure.    

Japan exported $1.47 billion of steel to the U.S. last year, according to Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The ministry has estimated that the U.S. measures add as much as $167 million a year in tariffs to Japanese steel exports to the U.S.

Oracle Seeks to Elect Four Board Members At Target PeopleSoft

ORACLE CORP. SAID it will seek the election of four new board members for PeopleSoft Inc. in an attempt to clear the way for Oracle's $7.3 billion hostile takeover bid.    

Oracle is seeking the new slate to help lift the software company's antitakeover provisions. Safra Catz, an Oracle executive vice president, said in a conference call that supporters of Oracle's bid will present the alternative slate in January, to comply with new PeopleSoft rules that require boardnominations be made at least 120 days in advance of the company's annual meeting, rather than between 20 days and 60 days, as was previously required. No date has been set for the election itself.    

Oracle's supporters plan to submit the nominations even before Oracle's bid has been cleared by U.S. and European antitrust regulators. "We have to file the independent slate now," Ms. Catz said. "Then we'll have the vote much later on." Even if the Redwood Shores, California, company is successful in its proxy fight to elect a new board, it isn't clear that the company's supporters will have the votes to change PeopleSoft's policies. Only four of PeopleSoft's eight board seats are up for election next year.    

Oracle executives said they held the conference call to clear up what they called "misconceptions in the market" surrounding the status of the PeopleSoft bid, which was announced in June but has effectively been on hold during the antitrust reviews. Ms. Catz said the company plans to complete the production of documents for the U.S. Justice Department within the next few weeks and expects a decision in January. "I believe the case will be well received" by the Justice Department, she said.    

The Oracle executives didn't say whether the company would raise the bid from the current offer of $19.50 a share, which is below the recent trading level of PeopleSoft's shares. In 4 p.m. trading on the Nasdaq stock market Monday, PeopleSoft was at $21.76, up $1.08, or 5.2%.    

Chuck Phillips, another Oracle executive vice president, said, "We won't pay an unreasonable price for a potentially impaired asset just to claim victory."    

Oracle's chief financial officer, Jeff Henley, asserted that PeopleSoft, of Pleasanton, California, improperly recognized some revenue in its third quarter that ended in September. Mr. Henley said a PeopleSoft refund offer, under which the company promised to pay customers between two and five times their software licensing fees under certain conditions, constituted a contingency that needs to be cleared before the revenue can be recognized, he said.    

PeopleSoft recently revised its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to clarify that the refunds will be triggered only by a takeover. "We're very confident our revenue is recognized appropriately," a PeopleSoft spokeswoman said. She declined to comment on Oracle's plan to nominate a slate of directors.

Macatawa Bank Expects Continued Growth

HOLLAND - Macatawa Bank Corp. expects strong growth to continue for the foreseeable future, although branch development should slow after 2004.    

Riding the ongoing branch buildup in the Kent County market, the Holland-based Macatawa Bank should maintain the same 15 percent to 20 percent annual growth rate that it has experienced in the past.    

Right now the bank's primary focus is growing in Kent County, where Macatawa will open its sixth branch by the end of the year and has three additional offices in Walker, Rockford and Cutlerville - planned for 2004.    

Selecting the right locations and the ability to recruit a strong staff "gives me a high level of confidence that we will be able to execute our plan of growth and achieve the same level of success we have enjoyed at our existing branches," bank President Phil Koning told brokerage analysts during an Oct. 21 conference call to discuss Macatawa's thirdquarter results.    

"There are still a lot of opportunities in that market," he said.    

After 2004, Koning expects Macatawa Bank's branch development in the Kent County market to slow to one or two offices annually for 2005 and 2006. The bank now has 20 offices in Ottawa, Kent and Allegan counties.    

For the third quarter, Macatawa Bank reported a 12 percent increase in earnings and strong gains in assets, loans and deposits.    

The corporation recorded third-quarter net income of $3.06 million, or 37 cents per share. That compares with net income of $2.73 million, or 33 cents per share, during the same period a year ago.    

Year to date, net income totaled $8.8 million, or $1.05 per share, up 33 percent from the $6.5 million, or 88 cents per share, during the first nine months of 2002.    

Total assets from a year ago are up 16.6 percent, from $1.11 billion to $1.29 billion as of Sept. 30. Total loans grew from $924.3 million a year ago to $1.08 billion, and increased in the third quarter alone by about 5 percent, or $51 million.    

Total deposits were up 13.8 percent from 12 months ago, growing from $877.9 million to $999.9 million.    

"We continued to generate significant growth in our core banking," Macatawa Bank Chairman and CEO Ben Smith said.    

During the quarter, Macatawa Ban entered one new market, Grand Haven, which has the second-largest deposit base in Ottawa County, at $600 million.    

Koning told analysts that he expects the Grand Haven office, now housed in temporary quarters as a permanent location is built, to generate enough new business to cover start-up costs and add to the corporate bottom line during 2004.    

In the Holland-Zeeland area, Macatawa has completed its branch buildup with the recent opening of an office in Holland Township, Koning said.    

"We now have excellent coverage and a strong franchise to meet the needs of this    

market," he said.

A Debt Timebomb That Could Cripple Nation'S Borrowers.

Britain's nation of borrowers were warned yesterday to brace themselves for a debt timebomb that will spell financial ruin for millions of people.    

An increasing number of Britons are finding themselves up to their eyeballs in debt, with the average personal debt now owed to lenders standing at a horrifying £25,000.    

Worse still, this figure does not even take into account money owed on mortgages - an average £126,434, according to the latest, June, figures.    

And with some lenders still prepared to offer up to six times an applicant's wage, a series of interest rate rises could quickly spell disaster for borrowers.    

As little as three years ago, a typical UK consumer facing financial difficulties owed an average of £10,000 to five or six creditors.    

Today, the same consumer owes £25,000 spread across a staggering 15 creditors, according to a survey compiled by the Credit Management Research Centre.    

The shock dossier revealed consumer borrowing is showing no sign of slowing down as it continues to be buoyed by rising house prices and low interest rates.    

Consumer credit, which includes mortgages, credit cards and loans, is increasing at a rate of around £1.7billion a month, with total outstanding debt of around £170billion.    

The report estimated consumers now owe the equivalent of about 118 per cent of their annual income, up from 90 per cent a decade ago.    

Meanwhile, a separate survey yesterday highlighted UK homeowners are facing a catastrophe if, as expected, interest rates go up.    

The report by Yorkshire Bank showed 60 per cent of people underestimate the impact a rate change would have on their mortgage.    

About 28 per cent admitted they had no idea how much a one per cent increase in mortgage rates would raise their monthly repayments, the study found.    

According to latest figures, a rise in interest rates of just half of one per cent, from 5.50 per cent to 6.00 per cent, would push monthly repayments on a £100,000 mortgage up by £30.22, from £614.08 to £644.30.    

Geoff Greer, head of Yorkshire Bank, said he feared home buyers were being lulled into a false sense of security by the current low interest rates. "They believe that paying today's inflated house prices can continue to be easily affordable, but it cannot," he said.    

The British borrowing boom has inevitably led to an increase in business for debt collectors, who now chase about £5billion of unpaid debt from consumers each year.    

Members of the Credit Services Association, which represents debt collectors, said they now deal with about 20million cases of people who are unable to keep up with repayments a year.    

And on top of the financial woes facing Britons, those embroiled in the endowment mortgage mess were warned the saga could cost millions more than expected.    

Experts say shortfalls could average at least £11,000, with nine out of every 10 policies failing to meet their target.

Scramble for a soaring profit COLLECTABLES.

Spitfires changed hands in the mid 1990s for about £400,000 but cost more than £1m today, with the top prices being paid for aircraft with an authentic service history.

"Worldwide there are only around 60 planes known of any condition, whilst of that only around 30 are actually flying," says Patrick Peal of Historic Flying, which restores and sells these old planes.

"The Spitfire has historic value," says Peal. "And while there is no such thing as a price guarantee, there is a finite supply, and the sort of people who buy our aircraft are not worried about a recession."

Indeed, the company is looking for offers above £1.25m each for two Spitfires. Earlier this year Ed Russell, a Canadian architect, paid what Peal calls "upwards of £1m" for an aircraft built in 1944 and restored to mint condition in the company's factory at Duxford, Cambs.

Immediately after the second world war you could have picked one up for the price of the fuel in its tank. "Prices went a bit mad in the late nineties," says Richard Goode, an importer of classic aircraft. "But now they have levelled out."

Prices can rise even higher if it can be proved that the aircraft saw active duty. "If a plane has known combat duty and it can be shown that it has shot down an enemy aircraft it gives it extra cachet," says Stephen Maycock, an auctioneer at Sotheby's in London. "Flying records are important and it all adds to the thrill for the collector."

But even if you can afford one of these rare machines, will you be able to fly it? Getting into the cockpit of a Spitfire has been likened to "putting on the machine". Turn on the engine and, according to one flier: "The vibration transferred to the seat of the pants communicates visceral power".

Peal agrees. "It has everything," he says, "the vibration, the smell, it looks great and it's a great challenge to fly."

The challenge does not end there. "Insurance costs are staggering," says Nick Bloom, deputy editor of Pilot magazine. The average owner flies the plane 25 hours per year and insurers charge 5 per cent of the hull price annually. Add on fuel at 200 gallons an hour and the average hourly cost of flying is between £2,000 and £3,000.

The costs involved mean that Spitfires owners tend to be, according to Peal, like racehorse owners. "They are passionate people making an informed investment."

Knowledge, as ever, is the key to a good investment and finding the right plane means a lot of research. There were 12 marks of Spitfire, each with its own market.

However, limited supply means that prices should not fall too far and if Peal believes there is no such thing as a guaranteed price, one thing he is prepared to guarantee a new Spitfire owner is "one hell of a good time".

$56.8 million county budget not hurt by NWC filing

Yellowstone County commissioners said Tuesday that the county's $56.8 million budget for fiscal year 2004 is balanced and fiscally responsible.    

But county officials also expressed some concerns about future budgets after the parent company of Yellowstone County's largest taxpayer, NorthWestern Energy, filed for bankruptcy protection Sunday.    

NorthWestern Energy is a subsidiary of NorthWestern Corp., which filed for Chapter R bankruptcy protection on Monday. NorthWestern Energy pays about $5 million per year in property taxes to Yellowstone County.    

Finance Director Scott Turner said the county has enough reserves on hand to continue operations if NorthWestern is late paying its property taxes while reorganizing. But some taxing entities, such as school districts, could be in a cash crunch if NorthWestern's bankruptcy case drags out, Turner said.    

"It's kind of an eye-opener," Turner said. "We haven't seen anything like this before."    

Last Friday, NorthWestern paid most of the delinquent property taxes for the second half of 2002. Because of that, unpaid taxes weren't tied up in bankruptcy proceedings.    

"We certainly appreciated that they paid their delinquent taxes last week," Turner said.    

NorthWestern doesn't owe any back taxes to Yellowstone County at this time. But County Treasurer Max Lenington said he's concerned that NorthWestern won't be able to pay its upcoming property tax bill, due in November.    

Local taxes account for $20.1 million in the county's 2004 budget, compared to $17.2 million levied last year. The county mill levy went from 74.59 mills to 84.94 mills, a 13.9 percent increase.    

Turner said about half of the min-levy increase resulted from a voter-approved levy of 4.75 mills for the Yellowstone CityCounty Health Department. The levy raises $973,954 per year for health programs. The new levy pays for disaster preparedness, immunizations, environmental health services and health services for senior citizens and families.    

A big increase in new construction generated an additional $1 million in county tax revenue. The remainder of the county's $58.6 million budget comes from a variety of state and federal sources.    

As part of Tuesday's budget hearing, officials from the Big Sky Economic Development Authority asked to increase the economic development agency's min levy from 2.46 mills to 2.64 mills. As a result, Big Sky EDA's countywide levy would increase from $504,000 to $542,077.    

Mike Schaer, a Big Sky EDA board member, said the additional tax revenue would help Yellowstone County be more competitive in bringing new businesses to town.    

Commissioners turned down the request on a 0-3 vote.    

"Even though $38,000 isn't a huge amount, we need to send a message that we need to be as conservative as possible," Commissioner Jim Reno said.    

"You've done a wonderful job. But we're tying to hold the line on tax increases," Commissioner John Ostlund said.

WORKPLACE - Employers play reward card.

Reward packages for staff can help offset this year's increase in national insurance, says CAROLYN STEPPLER    

More employees are being offered flexible reward packages as companies look to introduce tailored deals for their staff.    

The trend follows the rise in national insurance contributions, now hitting the pockets of employers and employees, together with a challenging economic climate that makes pay increases less likely.    

"Total reward packages" include benefits such as gym membership, additional life-cover or more holidays.    

But pensions are currently the hot favourite.    

At the time of a pay rise, for example, an employee can opt to have a chunk of their salary increase put direct into an approved pension scheme.    

Neither employer nor employee pays national insurance on the sum, and the saving can be invested as contributions to the pension.    

This way, the employee's pension benefit could increase substantially.    

On a salary of £30,000, a 25-year-old who opts to "sacrifice" 10 per cent of their potential salary into a pension over five years, could end up with at least £60,000 more in their pension fund at retirement.    

The tax-efficient topping up of pension schemes may grow in popularity as people become more aware of the benefits.    

There is no additional cost in tax or national insurance to the employer. There is no loss in net income for the employee, and staff have the potential to get higher pension benefits.    

Here are some tips on how to maximise flexible salary packages while minimising your tax liability:    

Childcare expenses are a taxable benefit where provided by your employer, but are not subject to national insurance contributions. There are savings to be made here for employer and employee.    

Mobile phones provided by employers are free of tax and national insurance.    

Make use of interest-free loans of up to £5,000 from your employer, such as for season tickets. The Inland Revenue does not take tax or national insurance on these.    

If you pay an annual subscription to a professional institution related to your job you can claim a tax deduction - but not a national insurance deduction.    

Before you change company car, think about the tax implications. Generally, cars with higher carbon dioxide emissions and diesel cars cost more in tax and national insurance.    

Computer equipment worth up to £2,500 provided by your employer for your personal use can also be free of tax and national insurance.    

Travel between work and home provided by an employer is exempt from income tax and national insurance. A similar exemption applies where an employer subsidises a local bus company, thus allowing employees to travel to work at a discounted fare.    

Employees who work from home can receive up to £2 per week free of tax and national insurance for additional household costs. Higher amounts can be reimbursed free of tax and national insurance if evidence of additional household costs is provided.

        WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The following table lists companies that in
the last two weeks have had news of receiving a notice of potential delisting
or a long-term suspension from trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the
American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market.
        Companies out of compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price standards
are given 180 calendar days to regain compliance. Companies on other
exchanges generally have 90 days to meet listing requirements but may appeal
the potential delisting. An appeal hearing gives the company an opportunity
to indicate how it intends to comply with all listing requirements.



        The "Action" column shows steps taken after a preliminary delisting
notice.
        The second table shows companies actually delisted from the three
major U.S. exchanges during the last two weeks.
