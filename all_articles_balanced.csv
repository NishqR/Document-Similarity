"Senator Reverend Warnock Introduces Bill to Ensure Georgia Car Buyers, Automakers Fully Benefit from Cost-Cutting Tax Credits","Senator Reverend Warnock Introduces Bill to Ensure Georgia Car Buyers, Automakers Fully Benefit from Cost-Cutting Tax Credits; Today, Senator Reverend Warnock introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act which would create a phase-in period for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA); Sen. Raphael G. Warnock (D-GA) News Release Washington, D.C. - Today, U.S. Senator Reverend Raphael Warnock (D-GA) introduced the Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act which would create a phase-in for the electric vehicle (EV) sourcing and manufacturing requirement provisions for automakers that was included in the final version of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act will ensure Georgians may immediately and fully benefit from the cost-cutting and job-creating provisions of the IRA, including tax credits that will lower the costs of electric vehicles.  ""I'm focused squarely on helping Georgia car buyers save money and helping car manufacturers who do business in our state thrive. The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Actwill lower costs for Georgians and provide consumers more options when purchasing an electric vehicle, while also supporting good-paying jobs across our state and bolstering Georgia automakers like Hyundai. I'm going to do everything I can to get this bill over the finish line,"" said Senator Reverend Warnock.  The Affordable Electric Vehicles for America Act would delay the IRA's phase-in period for automakers to follow specific sourcing requirements for their EVs in order for car buyers to qualify for the federal tax credit. These requirements include: requiring the EVs to be manufactured in North America; requiring EV batteries to be made domestically; and mandating that critical minerals used in battery production are only sourced domestically or from nations with whom America has a free trade agreement. Georgia automakers need additional time to meet these new on-shoring requirements and bring planned domestic EV facilities online, including the forthcoming Hyundai EV facility scheduled to open in 2025 in Bryan County, GA.  Senator Warnock has been a vocal champion for creating green jobs and reducing America's reliance on fossil fuels. Last week, Senator Reverend Warnock pushed the Biden Administration to implement the IRA's EV tax credit provision with ""maximum flexibility"" to ensure Georgia car buyers and manufacturers can fully benefit. In February, Senator Warnock announced that he secured nearly $20 million in funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to build out Georgia's EV infrastructure network across the state. Additionally, Senator Warnock has been in frequent contact with Hyundai about the auto manufacturer's footprint and future in Georgia, and has encouraged efforts on the federal level to bolster the company's presence--as well as EV and EV battery manufacturing, in general--in the state.

10 Markets Where Sellers Are Cutting Home Prices the Most,"Daily 10 Markets Where Sellers Are Cutting Home Prices the Most Sellers reduced their asking prices on roughly one in five U.S. home listings in September, according to data released today. The price cuts come as higher mortgage rates increase the cost of financing a home purchase, weighing on both buyers and sellers.  The share of listings with price reductions in September was 19.5%, according to Realtor.com's housing report-a 2022 high and up from 11% last September. (Barron's and the company that operates Realtor.com are both owned by News Corp.)  Some metropolitan areas in September saw more frequent reductions than others. Of the 50 largest metropolitan areas, the share of listings with price cuts was greatest in Phoenix; Austin; Las Vegas; Denver; Sacramento, Calif.; Dallas; Tampa, Fla.; Nashville, Tenn.; Portland, Ore.; and Jacksonville, Fla. The share of listings with price reductions in these markets ranged from 44% in Phoenix to 25.7% in Jacksonville.  The latest data illustrates a reset in seller expectations compared with the same month last year. With the exception of Portland, the metropolitan areas listed above also experienced the greatest year-over-year increase in the share of listings with price reductions.  Nationally, homes also took longer to sell, with the typical home spending seven more days on the market this month than during September 2021. Compared with the year prior, days on the market increased most in Raleigh, N.C.; Austin; Las Vegas; Phoenix; Charlotte N.C.; Riverside, Calif.; Denver; Nashville; Orlando, Fla.; and Sacramento.  Despite the uptick in price cuts, the median listing price in September remained higher than year-ago levels in all but two of the large metropolitan areas: Pittsburgh and New Orleans. The median listing price nationally was $427,000, representing a year-over-year increase of 13.9%, Realtor.com said.  The data is the latest to illustrate the housing market's quick shift from the early pandemic's buying frenzy to today's affordability-driven pullback as mortgage rates rise. The average 30-year fixed rate more than doubled this year as the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy to combat inflation, according to weekly Freddie Mac data.  Higher mortgage rates is one reason why the National Association of Realtors earlier this week revised down its existing-home sale and price expectations for 2023. The trade group expects sales to slump to their slowest annual rate since 2012 next year, and foresees annual price growth of 1.2%.  Amid the gloomy news is a potential bright spot for prospective buyers: the slower market could result in more wiggle room for those previously pushed to the sidelines by competition earlier in the pandemic. ""For prospective buyers grappling with affordability, you may have more bargaining power than you realize, particularly in areas where time on market is rising,"" Danielle Hale, chief economist of Realtor.com, said.

Students react to Biden's student debt relief plan,"Students react to Biden's student debt relief plan University of Mississippi ; University, MS - news  By Alyssa Conrad  Graphic by Savannah Shook.  Recently, President Joe Biden made good on his promise to forgive student loan debt. In an official statement addressing the student loan relief plan released on Aug. 24, Biden said it will allow people to ""finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt to get on top of their rent and utilities, to finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.""  Citizens with annual adjusted gross salaries less than $125,000 (or $250,000 per household) will receive $10,000 off their student loan debt. Citizens with qualifying salaries who are also eligible for a Pell Grant will receive an additional $10,000 off their student loans.  In order to qualify, the loans must be federal, not privately issued. Some current students are also eligible for student loan cancellation, based on free application for federal student aid and whether or not they filed as independent or dependent. Student loan forgiveness for independent students will be based on their own incomes, whereas parent incomes will be taken into account for those who filed as dependents.  Like citizens across the country, UM students have mixed feelings about the plan.  ""I think it's dumb because it's not fixing the underlying problem of higher education being too expensive in the first place,"" Mary-Patt Robben, a sophomore public policy major, said.  Robben believes that student loan forgiveness is not the correct way to combat the increasing cost of a college education and only provides a temporary solution for the issue.  But that isn't how everyone feels about the topic of student loan forgiveness. UM senior Jared Holly, a psychology and nursing major, wholeheartedly supports the new plan.  ""I'm all for it. I'll pay the taxes or whatever it takes. I'm not even necessarily one of those students in debt - I'm grateful to have parents who pay for my education, but I think we should cancel out more,"" Holly said.  Preston Kennedy, a sophomore international studies major also supports the plan, but he thinks that the plan does not go far enough.  ""I feel like, if we're going to spend this much, we should just forgive it all,"" Kennedy said. ""It's a step in the right direction, but if we're willing to spend billions of dollars on this, we should just go all the way.""  It is estimated that around 8 million citizens will get their expected debt forgiveness without needing to take any additional action because their current income information is on file with the U.S. Department of Education. For those without up to date income information on file, there will be an online form released where they can claim the debt forgiveness if they qualify for it. This application is expected to be released within the coming months.  ((Distributed for UWIRE via M2 Communications www.m2.com))",1
Drivers face Â£35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue,"News Drivers face Â£35bn tax bill to plug the gap as switch to electric cars hits revenue * Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police  * But at present drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty nor vehicle excise duty  * Government urged to have a 'conversation' with drivers on new ways to be taxed  * The report recommends 'road pricing' which would charge drivers per car trip  Drivers will have to pay new taxes to plug the Â£35billion shortfall created by the switch to electric cars - and ministers must spell out what they are, a report says today.  The Commons transport committee's report urges the Government to start an 'up-front conversation' with drivers about new ways they could be taxed.  At present, drivers of electric cars pay no fuel duty, which nets Â£28billion a year, or vehicle excise duty, which brings in Â£7billion.  Fuel duty is spent on schools, hospitals and other priorities such as the police.  Vehicle excise duty is spent fixing roads. To replace them, the report recommends 'road pricing', which would charge drivers per trip, based on the distance travelled, duration of the journey and vehicle type.  It also urges ministers to set up an arms-length body to recommend a new regime by the end of this year.  The sale of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned in 2030, so millions of motorists are expected to go electric before then.  A government spokesman said it was committed to keeping the transition to electric cars 'affordable for consumers'.  Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show plug-in vehicles accounted for more than one in six new cars registered in the UK last year.  'The situation is urgent,' the report warned. 'Work must begin without delay.'  Tory MP Huw Merriman, who chairs the committee, said the UK faces a 'Â£35 billion black hole in finances unless the Government acts now'.  He went on: 'That's 4% of the entire tax-take. Only Â£7 billion of this goes back to the roads; schools and hospitals could be impacted if motorists don't continue to pay.  'We need to talk about road pricing.  'Innovative technology could deliver a national road pricing scheme which prices up a journey based on the amount of road, and type of vehicle, used.'  He added: 'Net-zero emissions should not mean zero tax revenue.'  RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the 'silver lining of zero-carbon motoring comes wrapped in a cloud of trouble for the Chancellor'.  He went on: 'Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next - particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change.  'If the Treasury is thinking it can leave this issue for another day but still recoup their losses from electric vehicles they risk a furious backlash from drivers who made the choice to go electric expecting to save money.'",1

Hickenlooper (D-CO) News Release","Hickenlooper Cheers Record 200,000 Coloradans Enrolled for Health Insurance with Connect for Health; Sen. John W. Hickenlooper (D-CO) News Release Denver, Colo.-Today, Senator John Hickenlooper applauded Connect for Health Colorado's announcement that 198,412 Coloradans signed up for a health insurance plan by the end of the most recent Open Enrollment Period. This marks an increase of more than 18,000 enrollments, or 10 percent, above last year's end of Open Enrollment total, and is the highest end of Open Enrollment total since Connect for Health Colorado opened in 2013.  Three out of four customers who signed up for a plan qualified for health insurance savings via premium subsidies passed by Congress as part of the American Rescue Plan. Thanks to these subsidies, individuals can save an average of 52 percent on their monthly premium.  While the annual enrollment period has ended, uninsured residents who have been impacted by the recent fires in Boulder County or by COVID-19 can access a new Disaster Relief Special Enrollment Period now through March 16, 2022.  ""These numbers prove Connect for Health Colorado is a success story,"" said Colorado Senator John Hickenlooper. ""Congress needs to keep premiums low to make health care an affordable reality for every Coloradan.""  ""The record level of enrollments we're seeing tells me that people are finding plans in their budget and that our sign-up process is smoother than ever before,"" said Chief Executive Officer Kevin Patterson.  ""While the regular Open Enrollment Period is complete, we opened our doors again. We're here to make sure those who find themselves affected by the recent Marshall Fire and the pandemic can get the coverage and care they need,"" Patterson said.  ""The American Rescue Plan helped make health care more affordable and accessible for nearly 200,000 Coloradans. That is what progress looks like,"" said Colorado Senator Michael Bennet. ""As we continue to face ongoing challenges as a result of COVID-19 and the Marshall Fire, I'm grateful that the enrollment deadline has been extended to ensure more families can get covered this year.""

What happens when worker benefits are cut? Some suggest that workers offset benefit loss with more saving elsewhere; Evidence from state and...,"Encore News & Commentary What happens when worker benefits are cut? Some suggest that workers offset benefit loss with more saving elsewhere; Evidence from state and local workers suggests that doesn't always happen Evidence from state and local workers suggests that doesn't always happen  The economist's simple life cycle model predicts that workers will respond to a $1 decrease in their defined benefit savings by increasing their supplemental savings by $1. Whether this prediction holds in practice may turn out to be very important for state and local workers.  Read: Saving for retirement? Here are 4 key lessons  Although the common story is that these workers spend a full career in government and retire with substantial defined benefit pensions, that often is not the case - all plans are not equally generous, many plans may lack the funding to pay full benefits, and one in four public sector workers is not covered by Social Security.  Read: What's the best place for you to retire? Pick what matters most - you may be surprised  In other words, a lot of reasons exist for state and local workers to augment their pensions with outside saving, and all state workers and most local workers have access to supplemental defined-contribution plans - namely 457s, 401(k)s, 401(a)s, and 403(b)s.  To see whether public workers take advantage of these options, my colleagues estimated the relationship between participation in a supplemental defined-contribution plan, on the one hand, and low wealth accumulation in a defined-benefit plan, low plan funded levels, or lack of Social Security coverage, on the other. To do this analysis, they merged individual-level data in the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) with plan-level data from the Public Plans Database (PPD).  Read: The 5 most affordable Caribbean islands to retire to - and 2 to avoid  The key results suggest that workers do respond to low contributions to their primary defined-benefit plan - the solid red bars in figure 1 below - but the magnitudes are tiny. For example, a one-percentage-point increase in the employer contribution rate is only associated with a 0.19-percentage-point decrease in the participation rate, relative to a baseline of 21%. And the striped bars in Figure 1 show that workers do not respond at all to having a very poorly funded pension plan or not having Social Security coverage.  The bottom line is that people do not always respond as theory would suggest. State and local workers may simply not be aware of how much saving is taking place through their defined benefit pension; they may not appreciate the extent to which their plan is adequately funded; and they may not understand the implications of not being covered by Social Security.  Read: This no-nonsense strategy can get you the retirement you want  Whatever the reason for the lack of response, states and localities cannot count on their workers making up for reduced pension income through supplemental savings.",1
"SCAM ALERT: LOAN REPAYMENT COMPANIES SCAMMING STUDENTS, CHARGING THEM FOR SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR FREE","SCAM ALERT: LOAN REPAYMENT COMPANIES SCAMMING STUDENTS, CHARGING THEM FOR SERVICES AVAILABLE FOR FREE FRANKFORT, Ky., April 16 -- Gov. Andy Beshear issued the following news release:  Today, Gov. Andy Beshear and the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority (KHEAA) warned that if Kentucky students owe money on federal student loans, they should watch out for scamming loan repayment companies.  The companies offering to help students lower their payments may be charging large fees for services available for free.  ""My administration will always put education first, and part of that means protecting Kentucky students, after they've graduated, from predatory companies trying to take advantage of them as they pay back the loans that helped them pursue their education goals,"" Gov. Beshear said.  Some third-party companies claim to offer document preparation services and act as though they can help students qualify for a loan forgiveness program, but they may want upfront fees and personal and financial information. The Federal Trade Commission says it is illegal for companies to charge upfront fees before providing debt relief services.  The Governor and KHEAA warn borrowers to be skeptical about companies that:  Ask for payment up front and for monthly fees to monitor an account; Promise immediate loan forgiveness; or Ask for a student's FSA ID password and a power of attorney. ""To avoid falling victim to a scam, start with the servicer the Department of Education has assigned your loan to,"" said Gene Hutchins, executive director of the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority. ""Your servicer can tell you what your options are and can help you with the forms you need. And unlike these scam companies, your servicer will never charge you a fee for their assistance.""  If a student doesn't know what his or her servicer is, that information can be found at https://studentaid.gov/h/manage-loans.  If students believe they have been contacted by a scammer, they should report it to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau here and the Kentucky Attorney General's Office here.  This is KHEAA's Money Tip of the Month.  KHEAA is the state agency that administers Kentucky's grant and scholarship programs, including the Kentucky Educational Excellence Scholarship (KEES).

Biden Administration continues postponement of student loan debt payments for graduates,"Biden Administration continues postponement of student loan debt payments for graduates University of Texas - Austin ; Austin, TX - news  By  Current students and alumni will not have interest accumulating on their public student loans and alumni can defer payment until at least Sept. 30 due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of Education announced on March 30.  Kyle Morgenstein, an aerospace engineering graduate student who completed his undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said he has about $95,000 in student loan debt. He said not having to pay payments with interest accumulating has been helpful since he started his graduate studies during the pandemic.  ""Not having to pay that for this period means I can put some money away (or) I can spend on other things,"" Morgenstein said. ""I just moved to Austin, so there's moving expenses, so it's definitely freed up a lot of other things that I wouldn't have been able to do otherwise.""  When students go into graduate school right after completing undergraduate studies, they can continue to defer payments on their public loans until 6 or 9 months after graduating from their studies, depending on the type of loan, according to the federal student aid website.  Morgenstein said he planned to defer his payments until after he completed his graduate degree, but interest would have continued to accumulate without the COVID-19 relief. He said this would have caused him to pay $30,000 to $40,000 more in interest.  Angel Fletcher, radio-television-film freshman, said she plans to graduate in three years so she does not have to pay for a fourth year of college.  ""I'd love to not rush my schooling and pace myself and make better grades,"" Fletcher said. ""Instead of having $80,000 in debt, maybe I'll have $60,000 if I graduate in three years instead of four (years).""  Law professor Mechele Dickerson, who researches consumer protection and civil procedure, said there would be an economic benefit to canceling some student loan debt. She said if graduates constantly work towards paying off the student loans, they are delaying big life events such as buying a house or having children, which in the long run can have large-scale negative consequences for the economy.  According to The Hill, the Biden Administration is considering cancelling some public student debt through Congress.  Dickerson said it is hard to determine how much student loan debt forgiveness would be helpful to both the economy and the borrowers because of the disproportionate effect student loan debt has on low income students, Black students and Latinx students.  ""The reality is when you look at the average amount of student loan debt, it's about 25,000,"" Dickerson said. ""Most students don't owe 60, 70 (or) $80,000 in student loan debt.""

Historic level of funding available to help clinicians pay off student loan,"Historic level of funding available to help clinicians pay off student loan Southern Illinois University - Edwardsville; Edwardsville, IL - news  By  - The National Health Service Corps , a federal government program administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration , within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services , received a historic $800 million from the American Rescue Plan Act signed into law by President Biden to support the largest clinician workforce in the program's nearly 50-year history. The NHSC Loan Repayment Program helps medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health clinicians pay off their student loan debt in exchange for working in a Health Professional Shortage Area - or a defined geographic area with too few providers.

""Every community has felt COVID-19's effects and this will allow NHSC applicants to serve in communities where they may not have been competitive to receive an award before due to sites with lower HPSA scores.""  The NHSC is currently taking applications for three NHSC Loan Repayment Programs until May 6, 2021. Eligible disciplines include physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, dentists, behavioral/mental health clinicians, and more. Qualified clinicians may receive up to $100,000 in educational loan repayment, depending on the award.  Providers may apply for one of three NHSC loan repayment programs:  1) NHSC Loan Repayment Program  This two-year commitment program supports clinicians with up to $50,000 to pay off their student loan debt in exchange for service at an NHSC-approved site.  2) NHSC Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Program  This three-year commitment supports the recruitment and retention of health professionals with up to $75,000. Providers must be working to combat the nation's opioid crisis, expand access to evidence-based, medication-assisted treatment, and prevent overdose deaths in underserved areas. Applicants must work at an NHSC-approved SUD treatment facility located in a HPSA.  3) NHSC Rural Community Loan Repayment Program  This three-year commitment addresses the pressing need for qualified SUD providers in rural communities and awards up to $100,000 in loan repayment funds. Applicants must work at a NHSC-approved SUD treatment facility located in a rural HPSA.  Making an Impact  Currently, over 17 million people receive care from the more than 16,000-strong NHSC network of clinicians serving in urban, rural and tribal areas. Since the NHSC began, more than 63,000 primary care medical, dental, and mental and behavioral health professionals have served. By working with the NHSC, clinicians can help ensure access to health care for everyone regardless of their ability to pay, prevent disease and illness, and care for the nation's most vulnerable people.

Chancellor announces 50% 'Eat Out to Help Out' discount for pub and restaurant meals during August,"Chancellor announces 50% 'Eat Out to Help Out' discount for pub and restaurant meals during August People will be able to claim 50% off their meals in pubs and restaurants in August as part of plans to boost the flagging hospitality industry, Rishi Sunak has announced.  The Chancellor unveiled a range of measures to try and help the economy recover from the coronavirus pandemic, including a VAT cut on ""food, accommodation and attractions"".  AndÂ will be able to save half the cost of their food if they go out to eat between Monday and Wednesday from the Government.  Delivering his summer mini-budget he told the Commons: ""I can announce today that, for the month of August, we will give everyone in the country an 'Eat Out to Help Out' discount.  ""Meals eaten at any participating business, Monday to Wednesday, will be 50% off, up to a maximum discount of Â£10 per head for everyone, including children.Â   ""Businesses will need to register, and can do so through a simple website, open next Monday.  ""Each week in August, businesses can then claim the money back, with the funds in their bank account within five working days.""  Mr Sunak said he wants to see pubs, restaurants, cafes and B&Bs ""bustling again"", telling MPs: ""At the moment,Â VATÂ on hospitality and tourism is charged at 20%.  ""So I've decided, for the next six months, to cutÂ VATÂ on food, accommodation and attractions.""  The Chancellor saidÂ the salesÂ tax would be reduced to 5% from 15 July to 12 January, 2021.  ""This is a Â£4billion catalyst for the hospitality and tourism sectors, benefiting over 150,000 businesses, and consumers everywhere - all helping to protect 2.4 million jobs,"" he added.  The Treasury said the temporary VAT cut will apply to ""supplies of food and non-alcoholic drinks from restaurants, pubs, bars, cafÃ©s and similar premises across the UK"" - meaning booze is excluded.  The measures were welcomed by the Food and Drink Foundation, but it called for the option of extending the furlough scheme for the hostility industry to be kept on the table.  It chief executive Ian Wright said: ""The UK's food and drink manufacturers who supply into the hospitality and catering trade have been hard hit by the crisis, as their customers disappeared overnight.Â   ""These 'squeezed middle' firms will enthusiastically welcome the Chancellor's announcement today to cut VAT on food and hospitality and slash the cost of eating out.Â   ""We hope these measures will lead to a significant boost in demand for the hundreds of manufacturers who supply into hospitality and the out of home sectors and help them to manage increased supply costs.""  He added: ""However, if demand does not return quickly, these firms will continue to struggle unless they - and the sector they supply - receive additional employment support.Â   ""The Chancellor must therefore keep the option of extending full furlough support to hospitality and their food and drink suppliers in his back pocket so we do not lose vital jobs and businesses.""",1
Workers facing a lifetime of playing pension catch-up,"News Workers facing a lifetime of playing pension catch-up WORKERS in sectors including retail, travel and hospitality could face a lifetime of ""playing catch-up"" with their retirement savings, an insurer has warned.  Scottish Widows said many workers who are now taking a hit to their finances were already finding it difficult to save adequately for retirement before the coronavirus pandemic struck.  They could now struggle with ever being able to afford to retire.  Some are in sectors where businesses are feeling severe economic impacts from Covid-19, including the prospect of widespread job losses.  Scottish Widows' annual retirement report, looking at more than 5,000 adults across the UK, found that: Â¦ More than a quarter (27%) of people working in travel and the arts have not yet started saving into a pension; Â¦ Two-thirds (67%) of retail workers are worried that if they ever did retire, they would quickly run out of money; Â¦ Nearly two-thirds (62%) of construction workers feel they are not preparing adequately for retirement; and Â¦ Less than a fifth (18%) of restaurant workers are optimistic about their retirement.  It is highly likely that these workers are now also facing new financial pressures that will make saving for the long term even more difficult, Scottish Widows said.  It said one reason workers have historically been pessimistic about retirement, even before Covid-19, is employers who only contribute the legal minimum amounts into their pension.  Pete Glancy, head of policy at Scottish Widows, said that while around three in five people generally are estimated to be saving adequately for their retirement, ""long-term prospects are still to a large degree defined by the industry in which people work"".  ""That's because while auto-enrolment has transformed the retirement prospects of millions, minimum contributions are still far below what is needed to provide a good standard of living,"" he said.  ""We recognise that the next 12-18 months is going to be about businesses getting back on their feet, but many individuals have taken a substantial hit to their finances and the fear is that the gap can't be closed, meaning they face a lifetime of work as they struggle to afford to retire.""  Scottish Widows also said hardworking ""multi-jobbers"" risk being left behind.  For example, a quarter (24%) of people in travel and tourism and in the arts have more than one job. This rises to 27% of people who work in education, the report said.  In total there are around 6.8 million ""multi-jobbers"" in the UK, Scottish Widows said.  Its report warned they could miss out on pension contributions because their income is split across different employers, so they could fall short of the minimum earnings threshold for automatic enrolment for each of those jobs.  Mr Glancy added: ""The pension system unfairly penalises those who are in low-paid work. Scrapping the minimum earnings threshold would allow millions of multi-jobbers to benefit from auto-enrolment like everyone else, and is long overdue.""",1
"MENENDEZ WARNS OF IMPENDING EVICTION, FORECLOSURE CRISIS DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC","MENENDEZ WARNS OF IMPENDING EVICTION, FORECLOSURE CRISIS DUE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC WASHINGTON, DC, July 1 -- The office of Sen. Bob Menendez issued the following news release:  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), the ranking member of the Senate's housing subcommittee, today spoke on the Senate floor to warn his colleagues of a looming foreclosure and eviction crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout if Congress fails to act.  ""[A]n impending storm ... is brewing and headed our way. It will bring with it enormous financial pain. It will threaten public safety. It will make fighting the pandemic that much harder. And it will set back our nation's economic recovery,"" said Sen. Menendez. ""If the Senate fails to respond to this looming crisis, Americans will needlessly suffer, families will be displaced, personal fortunes will be wiped out, and the scars will run so deep, it could take decades to heal the wounds.""  Sen. Menendez urged his colleagues to pass four separate pieces of legislation aimed at stabilizing the housing market and ensuring residents can remain safe and secure in their homes.  This week, he introduced the Coronavirus Housing Counseling Improvement Act (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/search?q=housing+counseling&access=p&as_dt=i&as_epq=&as_eq=&as_lq=&as_occt=any&as_oq=&as_q=&as_sitesearch=&client=wyden&sntsp=0&filter=0&getfields=&lr=&num=15&numgm=3&oe=UTF8&output=xml_no_dtd&partialfields=&proxycustom=&proxyreload=0&proxystylesheet=default_frontend&requiredfields=&sitesearch=&sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&start=0&ud=1) to expand access to critical information, assistance programs and services for millions of families struggling to remain in their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic fallout. According to research, homeowners who receive counseling have a better chance at avoiding default, protecting their credit scores, reducing debt and securing mortgage modifications.  Sen. Menendez announced that he will introduce a separate bill, the Emergency Housing Assistance for Older Adults Act, which would provide $1.2 billion for two key HUD housing assistance programs in order to ensure that federally-assisted senior housing facilities have the necessary resources to effectively protect residents during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The senator has cosponsored the Housing Assistance Fund (https://www.menendez.senate.gov/news-and-events/press/menendez-will-introduce-bill-to-create-new-75b-housing-assistance-fund-to-keep-nj-families-in-their-homes) to provide $75 billion in targeted assistance to keep people in their homes while they search for new employment or wait to get back to work by helping residents pay the mortgage, utilities, and support to prevent eviction, delinquency or foreclosure. He is also an original cosponsor of the Emergency Rental Assistance and Rental Market Stabilization Act, which would provide $100 billion to help families pay rent and help property owners maintain safe and healthy housing.

Realtors demand looser mortgage rules; Also call on federal candidates to boost first-time buyers credit,"Business Realtors demand looser mortgage rules; Also call on federal candidates to boost first-time buyers credit Real estate boards across the country are calling on federal candidates in next month's election to support loosening mortgage stress tests, saying that will make it easier for Canadians to buy homes.  ""The federal government should view the stress test as a flexible policy and adjust it based on changing economic trends and interest rates,"" the Toronto Real Estate Board wrote in a statement released Thursday morning.  Introduced in 2018, the mortgage stress test requires potential buyers - even those with a down payment of 20 per cent or more - to demonstrate that they can afford a mortgage (or home equity line of credit) at a rate two percentage points above the rate being offered or at the Bank of Canada's five-year benchmark rate, whichever is higher.  The stricter mortgage rules were introduced by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions to shore up the underwriting of banks as Canadian household debt hit record levels. The stress test also helped to cool overheated housing markets in Toronto and Vancouver.  Real estate boards representing realtors from Toronto, Calgary, Vancouver and Edmonton, as well as real estate associations in Quebec and Nova Scotia, have all signed on to Thursday's statement.  The coalition of about 92,000 realtors is also calling on parties to reinstate 30-year mortgages and replace the $750 first-time home buyers tax credit with a $2,500 non-refundable one instead.  They argue the current guideline enforces a ""one-size-fits-all solution"" that's to the detriment of many.  ""Quebec's home ownership rate continues to lag, according to the 2016 census, as it stands at 61 per cent in Quebec compared to more than 70 per cent in Canada's other provinces,"" Julie Saucier, the president of Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers, said in the statement.  ""We believe that there needs to be better support offered to buyers of residential properties, particularly first-time buyers.""  In April, CIBC World Markets deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal released a report showing at least half of the $25-billion decline in new mortgages since 2018 was due to the introduction of the stress test.  The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. has maintained in the past that mortgage stress tests are needed to prevent property price inflation. ""My job is to advise you against this reckless myopia and protect our economy from potentially tragic consequences,"" CMHC president and CEO Evan Siddall wrote in May in a letter to the Standing Committee on Finance.  Siddall said banks have supported the loosening of the regulation only because they're backed by a guarantee from the federal government.  ""I doubt they'd be as cavalier if it were their risk,"" he told the Star in late May. ""Critics of the stress test ignore the fact that high house prices are the overwhelming reason why home ownership is out of reach.""",1
Waters Opening Statement at Hearing on Student Loan Debt Crisis; House Financial Services Committee News Release,"Waters Opening Statement at Hearing on Student Loan Debt Crisis; House Financial Services Committee News Release Today, Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA), Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, gave the following opening statement at a full Committee hearing entitled, ""A $1.5 Trillion Crisis: Protecting Student Borrowers and Holding Student Loan Servicers Accountable.""  As Prepared for Delivery  Good morning. Today this Committee convenes for a hearing to examine the student loan debt crisis. It appears that this may in fact be the first ever full Committee hearing in this Committee's history focused on student lending and the many financial ramifications it has for student borrowers. Given the scale of the crisis at hand, it is long overdue. I thank Congressman Al Green, Chairman of our Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, for convening a Subcommittee hearing on this subject earlier this year, and look forward to building on the insights from that hearing during our conversation today.  According to the Federal Reserve, Americans collectively have over $1.6 trillion in student loan debt. That's more than credit card debt, and more than car loan debt, trailing only mortgage debt. More than 44 million people carry student debt averaging almost $33,000. Around 9 million borrowers with federal student loans are currently in default. The burden of student loan debt is preventing young people from saving for retirement, starting small businesses, starting families, and becoming homeowners. This crisis is affecting people across the country, and ultimately it negatively affects our entire economy.  Nevertheless, Trump's Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos, has consistently taken actions that are harmful for those with student loans, and the Trump Administration's appointees to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have also undermined key protections. Just last month, the Trump Administration appointed as Student Loan Ombudsman a former executive of a major student loan servicer that is being investigated by several state attorneys general for illegal student loan servicing practices.  I am pleased that we are joined by an outstanding panel of witnesses today, including witnesses who have personally dealt with student loans, have used their positions to raise awareness about the student debt crisis, or who have fought on behalf of consumers against the harmful practices of student loan servicers.  The Education and Labor Committee has an important role to play in this matter, but this Committee does as well, given the need to strengthen protections for student loan borrowers and conduct oversight in the area of student loan servicing. Today we will discuss a series of bills that are designed to help student loan borrowers in a variety of ways. These bills include creating a comprehensive student borrower bill of rights, strengthening credit reporting standards, stopping private debt collectors from going after vulnerable student borrowers, protecting private student loan borrowers, and helping borrowers with student debt purchase their first home. Congress - and this Committee - have a responsibility to take action to ensure student loan borrowers are better protected.

According to Secure Retirement Institute research, just 16% of American workers believe they are saving enough for retirement.

Landlords charge 'pet rent' to recoup losses after ban on unfair fees,"Money Landlords charge 'pet rent' to recoup losses after ban on unfair fees Practice has emerged since new law designed to save renters in England money  Landlords are charging ""pet rent"" running into hundreds of pounds a year in an attempt to recoup losses from a ban on unfair letting fees enforced by the government this summer.  The new practice means tenants with animals are being charged up to Â£50 a month additional rent for a single pet, adding considerably to the cost of housing at a time when more and more families are priced out of buying and rely on rented homes.  One landlord in Bicester in Oxfordshire is asking Â£40 per pet in monthly rent in a two-bedroom home that already costs Â£995 a month for the human occupants. It means a family with a dog and two cats would face a yearly animal rent of over Â£1,400. Another in Cheltenham is asking Â£50 a month for ""four-legged friends"" with exemptions for fish or hamsters. Several landlords are seeking pet rent only for ""clawed"" pets.  ""In certain letting agencies it seems to be a standard term in agreements,"" said Darren Baxter, a renter currently searching for a new home in York with his partner, two children and cocker spaniel Padfoot. ""It seems exorbitant given the potential damage a pet can cause. We went to one place where they wanted a reference for the dog. That was ridiculous.""  He said it was another example of how people who cannot afford to buy are disadvantaged in terms of being able to enjoy some of the basics of family life.  One letting agent said the new practice had only emerged since June, when landlords were banned from charging cleaning fees at the end of a tenancy or demanding an additional pet deposit as a result of total deposits being capped at five weeks' rent.  Before the Tenant Fees Act 2019, which was supposed to save renters across England Â£240m a year, landlords often asked for pet deposits of around Â£150, repayable at the end of the tenancy. Pet rents now mean they have no choice but to pay more.  ""The only way to do it is to charge higher rent,"" said Karolina Misiukiewicz, administrator at Elliot Oliver, an estate agent in Cheltenham. ""It's a new thing for us. In our experience we haven't taken extra for hamsters or gerbils and definitely not fish.""  Dozens of adverts for homes demanding pet rent can be seen on the rental websites Rightmove and Zoopla, along with many more refusing to take pets.  Half of UK adults own a pet, with 11 million owning cats and almost 9 million owning dogs, according to the veterinary charity PDSA. At the same time more and more families are having to rent. A quarter of families in England rent privately, reaching nearly 1.6m last year, more than double the number recorded in the government's English Housing Survey a decade earlier.",1
"Advice fees vary by 1,000 per cent","News Advice fees vary by 1,000 per cent New research highlights significant divergence in fee structures  Adviser fees for retirement advice can vary by up to 1,000 per cent, new research has found, at the same time as an expert revealed other charging models are starting to gain traction.  A survey conducted by consumer champion Which? asked 108 advisers how much they would charge for advice in three different scenarios, and the results revealed a vast degree of disparity.  In the first scenario, advisers were asked to quote costs for someone approaching retirement, and aiming to start drawing an income, with Â£100,000 in savings, Â£150,000 in a pension, and Â£100,000 in an investment Isa.  The maximum quote from intermediaries was Â£5,000, 10 times more expensive than the lowest (Â£500).  Other examples revealed a similar trend. Scenario three described a client with no mortgage and ""comfortable"" savings, with a Â£100,000 inheritance to invest. Results again were wide-ranging, with the maximum fee at Â£3,000, the minimum once again at Â£500, and the average Â£1,980.  Scenario two took a difference stance, as the individual expressed a need to start saving for a child's education, instead of looking for advice on lump sums. But a vast disparity in fees was still evident. The cheapest, at Â£300, was still Â£2,200 lower than the most expensive.  Advice costs have come under increasing pressure in recent weeks, with the Financial Conduct Authority stepping in after finding that some models present a risk to consumers in certain areas of advice.  The regulator's recent proposal to ban contingent charging for defined benefit to defined contribution transfers is a case in point.  Anecdotally at least, changes are occurring in the way intermediaries charge for advice. In an article responding to the FCA's proposed contingent charging ban, Abbie Knight, founder of Discus, said that over recent years there had been a notable increase in advisers moving towards a ""menu-forservice"" model.  This involves time-costing each piece of work and applying an appropriate profit margin. The fee can then be adjusted for cases that require additional resource due to time or complexity.  Ms Knight said: ""This menubased charging approach is built on the premise that the process and steps involved in delivering each service remains the same, irrespective of the size of the investment.  ""The menu model ensures clients only pay for the service they receive - a stark contrast to the traditional percentagebased charging model."" A further issue of relevance to advisory fees has been the number of consumers feeling priced out of advice, resulting in the much-publicised advice gap. The FCA is revisiting this area via its analysis of the Retail Distribution Review and the Financial Advice Market Review, but its assessments are not due to be published until next summer. craig.rickman@ft.com  'The menu model ensures clients only pay for the service they receive - a stark contrast to the traditional percentagebased charging model'",1
Super Saturday set to see Â£1.65billion blown on the high street before Christmas,"Money Super Saturday set to see Â£1.65billion blown on the high street before Christmas 10.1 million shoppers will descend on the high street to spend Â£1.38 billion on gifts and festive food and drink  Shoppers are expected to spend Â£1.65 billion on Super Saturday this weekend as they hit the high street in preparation for Christmas Day.  Some 10.1 million shoppers will visit the beleaguered high street to spend Â£1.38 billion on gifts and festive food and drink, while 4.8 million will spend Â£268 million online in the hope that their purchases can be delivered on time, according to predictions by VoucherCodes.co.uk and the Centre for Retail Research.  The anticipated rush should provide a fillip after a disappointing weekend for retailers with gales, snow and freezing rain brought by Storm Deirdre blamed for lower shopper numbers.  Combined footfall for high streets, retail parks and shopping centres was down 4.3% on the same weekend last year, according to retail intelligence experts Springboard.  Online sales are expected to peak the day before on 'Frenzied Friday' as 7.2 million shoppers spend Â£321 million on last-minute gifts.  Laura Ashley 40 new store closures update - what we know about the shops closing  Footfall is expected to be up 20% on the daily average on Super Saturday, while Sunday and Christmas Eve are anticipated to both be up by 5%, according to retail analysts ShopperTrak.  ShopperTrak UK director Steve Richardson said: ""As the last working day for many before Christmas, Frenzied Friday marks the start of the last-minute festive footfall rush, with footfall set to rise across the weekend.  ""Friday is also significant in that it marks the moment that shoppers move away from buying online and instead head into stores to finish off Christmas shopping.  ""In spite of retailers offering later and later fulfilment options, shoppers will head on to the high street, fuelled by the fear that online gifts may not arrive in time for the big day, as well as taking advantage of click-and-collect orders, which some retailers are promising to fulfil on Christmas Eve itself.""  Gift cards could be the worst present possible - your rights if things go wrong  The UK high street has been hit hard this year as several large companies entered administration including House of Fraser and Evans Cycles, which were both bought by Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley.  Names such as Toys R Us UK, Poundworld and electronic retailer Maplin also fell into administration, while fashion chain New Look, Marks & Spencer and Debenhams all announced store closures.  Jimmy New, director of marketing at VoucherCodes, said: ""Super Saturday will be a big shopping day for both retailers and consumers alike as millions flock to stores looking to snap up last-minute gifts and other essentials before Christmas Day.  ""It'll certainly be one of the busiest shopping days on the high street so, if you do brave the shops, expect crowds.""  Christmas food and drink",1
BlackRock and Microsoft want to make retirement investing as easy as ordering an Uber,"BlackRock and Microsoft want to make retirement investing as easy as ordering an Uber * BlackRock and Microsoft are teaming up to build retirement tools for individual investors, a growing market as employers shift away from pensions.  * The partners will launch an unnamed product, still in development, next year for companies to offer to their employees.  * About 40% of Americans say they are not confident they will have enough money in retirement.  BlackRock has inked its biggest technology partnership yet, aiming to help Americans save for retirement.  The firm is working with Microsoft to build a platform for retirement savings that will launch next year, the world's largest asset manager said Thursday. Spokespeople for Microsoft and BlackRock declined further comment.  The product, which will be offered through employers, is still under development, a source with knowledge of the platform said. It's designed to be user-friendly, with a goal of being as intuitive as ride-hailing application Uber.  The idea stemmed from a conversation earlier this year between BlackRock chief executive officer Larry Fink and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, in which the executives discussed creative ways for companies to address America's retirement crisis. Last year, Fink called the problems associated with longevity ""one of the greatest financial challenges faced by our clients today.""  About 40% of Americans said they are not confident they will have enough money in retirement, according to a Wells Fargo survey last month.  BlackRock currently oversees about $1 trillion in defined contribution assets, out of $6.4 trillion total assets under management. The firm is eyeing growth in the space as more private and public employers move away from pricier pensions to cheaper definied contribution plans, in which employees contribute a portion of their paycheck toward retirement.

"Can't afford kale and coconut water? Dietitian reveals the cheap, often-overlooked 'superfoods' that you can pick up at your local...","Femail Can't afford kale and coconut water? Dietitian reveals the cheap, often-overlooked 'superfoods' that you can pick up at your local supermarket for a fraction of what on-trend items cost * You don't need to spend a lot of money to reap the rewards of superfoods  * A dietitian has revealed the cheaper alternatives people can include in their diet  * Amelia Harray explained that there is 'no definition of a superfood'  'Superfoods' have been the buzzword in the health industry for a few years, but many simply cannot afford to splash out on kale and coconut water during their weekly shop.  Luckily for those trying to save their cash, there are plenty of fruits and vegetables that are just as good.  Today Tonight spoke with dietitian, Amelia Harray, who revealed the less expensive alternatives people can include in their diet to reap the same health benefits.  'There's no definition of a superfood, which makes it really confusing for people,' she said.  Scroll down for video  LEAFY GREENS  Kale became popular years ago, with many people palming it off as a passing fad, but it is a healthy addition to any diet.  The leafy green is high in folate and vitamin K, like iceberg lettuce, and although it has a good amount of fibre, spinach has more.  'Spinach actually contains more iron than kale does too,' Amelia explained.  Unfortunately what some people don't realise is that when you blend fruit and vegetables their fibre content decreases.  'I really encourage people to eat food rather than drink it, because when you're eating, you're chewing, and you're actually getting really full from the fibre, your gut is having to work,' Amelia said.  OLIVE OIL  Coconut oil is another item that has been deemed a 'superfood', but Amelia doesn't think it deserves that title.  'There is no benefit from coconut oil in cooking. if anything it'll just increase your bad cholesterol in your blood,' Amelia warned.  'You're far better off eating olive oil, avocado oil, canola oil and rice bran oil.  'There are lots of options that are much cheaper and much better for you.'  BANANAS  Since bananas are easily accessible in a lot of countries, they are often over-looked.  Although coconut water is rich in nutrients and is definitely good for you, studies have shown that it doesn't do any better a job of hydrating you than water.  '[It has] nutrients like magnesium, potassium and phosphate, but so do bananas, and you're paying a lot more for coconut water,' Amelia said.  AVOCADO  Two members behind Peak Body fitness, Faye Sheridan and Tony Merrick, said they believe it's good to know what you're body is lacking in.  Although they understand that health powders are popular, they like to stick with wholefoods first, such as homemade kimchi, eggs and avocado.  The pair believes that people should be mindful of the social media hype of superfoods and supplements.",1
"'eBay fraudster stole Â£1,023 and my gold coins but PayPal won't refund me'","Money 'eBay fraudster stole Â£1,023 and my gold coins but PayPal won't refund me' I received payment via PayPal from a buyer of two gold coins I had sold on eBay. Shortly after, I received a message from the buyer's official eBay account asking me to send the coins to a different address.  I duly sent the recorded delivery package as requested.  According to Royal Mail tracking, it arrived the next day.  Two days later, after the coins had been signed for, I received an email from PayPal stating that the buyer's account had been hacked and the money I had received was an unauthorised payment.  Once I explained that there had been a change of address, PayPal promptly refunded my money back to the buyer from my account. So I have lost the money and the gold coins.  eBay has now refunded its commission to me and PayPal has paid back half of what I lost but I am still out of pocket to the tune of Â£1,023.  Can you get this back for me?  JJ, Warwickshire  Initially I approached eBay, which said that because you had sent the items to a different address there was nothing more it could do.  It said it is important for sellers to send items to the address provided in their buyer's ""View Order Details"".  It said: ""Sending the item to another address is likely to mean the item isn't covered by seller protection.""  With PayPal, as usual there were promptings from me, calls not returned and wrong responses that I had to correct.  My involvement did lead to PayPal issuing you with a full refund ""as a goodwill gesture"", so the remaining Â£1,023 has been reimbursed.  Its response had been in a similar vein to eBay's, with it saying: ""Our Seller Protection policy can cover the cost of unauthorised payments, if the seller can provide us with proof of postage and delivery to the buyer's address as specified in the transaction confirmation. In Mr J's case he sent his goods to a different address.""  I had checked PayPal's seller protection and thought that gold anyway was not eligible. PayPal had not picked up on this and only when I queried this came back saying that PayPal's seller protection does not indeed cover payments made in respect of gold in any physical form.  Previously it admitted it had been distracted by the address issue.  The item had been delivered to a flat above a taxi service. I called the taxi service, which said the flats were rented independently.  I suggested that, armed with the crime number you acquired when you reported this matter to Action Fraud, the UK's national fraud and cyber crime reporting centre, (0300 123 2040 and actionfraud.police.uk), you should urge the local police to pay a visit.  It seems possible that the fraudster may soon be apprehended.  Get in touch | How to contact Jessica Gorst-Williams",1
Equity release: read these top tips before you borrow against your home,"Banking Equity release: read these top tips before you borrow against your home Equity release is becoming more popular among older homeowners. It allows those aged 55 or more to borrow a lump sum against the value of their home, with interest payments normally deferred until the house is sold when the owner dies or goes into care.  There are various reasons why equity release might be attractive to homeowners: they may want cash to help a grandchild buy a home, for example, or may need to supplement their own pension income - there are versions of equity release that allow you to make regular withdrawals.  If you do withdraw a lump sum, you can choose to make interest payments so that the sum repayable does not grow; if you allow interest to roll up instead, the amount borrowed can become very large should you live a long time, although equity release plans come with a ""no negative equity"" guarantee.  There are several crucial things to consider before you choose equity release.  Nigel Waterson, chairman of the Equity Release Council, the industry body, said: ""For anyone considering taking out an equity release plan, there are a number of things to consider.  ""First and foremost, it is important that you speak with a qualified adviser who belongs to the Equity Release Council. They will be able to provide you with professional guidance and will ensure that you are able to consider all your options.""  Here are ten top tips to consider:  * Do some research. Unbiased information can be found via the Money Advice Service Guide to Retirement and at equityreleasecouncil.com .  * Consider all your options. Make sure all state benefits are claimed and think about downsizing, renting out a room or asking for help from your family.  * If you take out an equity release plan to pay off an interest-only mortgage, speak with your existing lender to discuss all the options they can offer.  * Discuss your plans with family. They may be able to help or support your decision to take equity release.  * Compile a budget planner to work out what your income requirements are and how they might change over the years.  * If equity release is needed for home improvements, check to see if the local authority offers any grants for the work required.  * Don't take for granted what others tell you about equity release but make sure you speak with a qualified adviser who is a member of the Equity Release Council.  * In addition, take independent legal advice.  * Consider the type of equity release you need. An adviser will help you understand the difference between home reversion plans (where ownership is transferred to the lender at the outset), lifetime mortgages and the different types of plan.  * Don't assume that the lowest interest rate is the best. The plans have various features, some of which may be more suitable. For instance, some allow you to make monthly repayments to avoid the interest rolling up.  Sign up to our emails",1
Getting a loan is all about risk,"Getting a loan is all about risk IF YOU are thinking about applying for a home loan, it's important to gain an understanding of what the banks and lenders look for in the approval process.  The lender will assess your financial position and ability to service the loan, and based on the level of risk that you impose on them, will make a decision on how much or how little they are prepared to lend you, says Loan Market.  Let's look at some of the important key measures used by lenders to help assess your risk.  Income  Your current income will be used to determine the amount of money you can borrow.  Earning a higher income could suggest that you are able to better service your home loan.  But it's not just about what you earn - the lender will also look at your employment history and tenure.  In addition, they will assess your employment status (i.e. full-time, part-time, casual, permanent) to better understand your position.  In the case of self-employed applicants, the process may require more work and further lender scrutiny as the risk is usually higher.  Credit history  Your credit history gives the lender an indication of how you conduct your debts.  Having a clean credit history can increase your chances of borrowing a higher amount because it demonstrates that you are a responsible borrower.  You can request a copy of your credit file to ensure there isn't a black mark against your name.  The last thing you want is to be knocked back by your lender because of a telco default you incurred a few years ago.  In Australia, you can obtain your credit report from VEDA for free.  Deposit amount  The larger the amount you have for a deposit, the less risk the lender is taking when lending to you.  Having regular and consistent deposits made into your bank account will show the lender your ability to save despite having other current expenses.  Debts  Having debts can also determine your borrowing eligibility.  If you have any outstanding debts such as credit cards or personal loans, it would be beneficial to have them paid off before applying for a home loan.  If you have multiple debts, combining them into one could also help to reduce your repayments, which will look more favourable to the lender.  The lender will assess how much money you have left over (after paying your debts) and determine whether you will still be able to afford paying a mortgage.  A mortgage broker plays a key role when you're looking for home loan approval.  You can speak to them about the best way to position yourself to maximise your chances of having your home loan approved.  If you're looking to roll your debts into one, a mortgage broker can talk to you about your options when it comes to a consolidation loan.  This can not only reduce your monthly repayments but can also get you a lower interest rate.",1
Warning on rate hikes,"Business Warning on rate hikes HOME loan borrowers face a short and sharp series of interest rate hikes which threaten to add an extra $375 to the average monthly repayment bill, a former Reserve Bank board member has warned.  Highly-respected economist John Edwards says home loan borrowers should brace for eight consecutive hikes to the nation's official cash rate over the next two years.  Mr Edwards said the cash rate is ""way below"" where it needs to be should the RBA's own economic growth and inflation forecasts pan out.  The cash rate would need to be hiked from 1.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent by the end of 2019 if Australia's economic growth rate return to 3 per cent in the next few years as the RBA expects, Dr Edwards said.  The average standard variable mortgage would rise from 4.44 per cent to 6.44 per cent under such a scenario, analysis from financial services firm Mozo shows.  A borrower with a $300,000 loan would need to find $375 extra per month. ""It seems to me that something like eight quarter-percentage-point tightenings over 2018 and 2019 are distinctly possible if the RBA's economic forecasts prove correct,"" Dr Edwards wrote in a paper for the Lowy Institute think tank.  ""It's possible the tightening could start earlier, or if not the tightening itself, at least the signalling which should precede it.  ""We may be seeing a little of that now."" Dr Edwards said the current cash rate was outside any historic norm given it had averaged 5.2 per cent over the past 20 years and only fell to 3 per cent in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis.  While the RBA would not want to increase rates ""too abruptly or unexpectedly"", Dr Edwards cautioned the inevitable lift in borrowing costs would not necessarily be ""gentle or gradual."" Former RBA governor Ian Macfarlane hiked the cash rate 1.5 per cent to 6.25 per cent in the 10 months to August 2000 while his successor Glenn Stevens took less than two years to lift the rate from 5.5 per cent in April 2006 to 7.25 per cent in March 2008.  The Bank for International Settlements, the governing body of central banks, this week warned Australia's record levels of household debt leaves it highly vulnerable to a sharp rise in global interest rates.  AMP Capital chief economist Dr Shane Oliver said Dr Edward's forecast ""seemed extreme"" and noted the RBA had consistently over-estimated economic growth in recent years.  Dr Oliver said low wage growth and underemployment would keep inflation low for the foreseeable future.  ""I struggle to see much of any interest rate hikes in the coming years,"" he said.

Maternity leave - What happens if the baby's born early,"Money Maternity leave - What happens if the baby's born early Every woman working in the UK is allowed 52 weeks' leave after they have a baby - but what happens if the baby is premature? These are your rights  For some mothers, everything is straightforward. Their baby returns home with them from hospital straight from the labour ward and their maternity leave continues for the next 52 weeks if they want.  For others, things are less simple.  That's because maternity leave automatically starts from the day you give birth, not the day your child's strong enough to come home with you.  ""An employee can choose to start her maternity leave on any day, provided that it is not longer than 11 weeks before the week the baby is due,"" explained Aye Limbin Glassey, employment law partner at Shakespeare Martineau.  ""However where a baby is born prematurely her maternity leave starts automatically on the day after the date of the birth, no matter whether born prematurely or not.""  Statutory Maternity Pay explained: How to get it, how much money you can claim and how long it lasts  ""When workers have children prematurely, they are under an enormous amount of strain dealing with the baby and even when their child is well enough to leave hospital care, they will have to face the stark reality that a significant chunk of their statutory leave and pay has been used up,"" Limbin Glassey explained.  ""This seems harsh and it is understandable that parents in this position would feel that they need more flexibility and support.  ""However, under current laws, maternity leave and pay automatically starts the day after a premature baby is born and employers are under no obligation to extend this,"" she added.  The good news is that this week an amendment to the law is being debated in Parliament that would change things if passed.  ""If the amendment ... is made law, employers could be obliged to delay the start of maternity leave and pay to begin only after the period for which the premature baby is under hospital care,"" Limbin Glassey said.  Meet the mum campaigning for more maternity leave for mothers of premature babies  While things could soon change, that's of little help to people having children before then.  So what can you do now?  ""We advise that parents facing this situation start discussions with their employer at the earliest opportunity to enable the employer to put necessary arrangements in place and limit disruption,"" Limbin Glassey said.  ""The more time an employer is given to be able to fully consider the options and plan, the more likely it is that an agreement can be reached.  ""This is understandably unlikely to be the parent's top priority, so they may want to consider nominating someone like a family member to maintain communication with their employer on their behalf.  ""This will allow for a mutually-beneficial working relationship throughout the maternity period and beyond.""  Was your baby born too soon? (JotForm)",1
Australia : New data highlights the flaws in failed VET FEE-HELP scheme,"Australia : New data highlights the flaws in failed VET FEE-HELP scheme New statistics released today reveal the full extent of the failure of Labors VET FEE-HELP scheme that has seen unscrupulous providers prey on vulnerable students and the cost to taxpayers blow out from $325 million in 2012 to $1.8 billion in 2014 and $2.9 billion in 2015.  Minister for Education and Training Simon Birmingham said the issues with VET FEE-HELP are why the Turnbull Government will shut it down at the end of 2016 with the new VET Student Loans program starting in January with course restrictions for providers, loan caps and student engagement requirements.  The 2015 data is littered with even more examples of rorting and shonky behaviour from some providers who continue to take advantage of students and taxpayers and tarnish the reputation of the vocational education and training sector, Minister Birmingham said.  The Turnbull Governments new VET Student Loans program will return integrity to the vocational education sector and deliver a win-win for students and taxpayers through a range of protections.  Minister Birmingham said the new data showed the number of enrolments had increased from just 5,300 in 2009 to around 321,000 in 2015, highlighting the runaway growth in the scheme before our initial reforms started to fix it in 2016.  Minister Birmingham said that the structure of VET FEE-HELP scheme meant there were too many students being signed up for courses simply to boost providers enrolment numbers or to provide lifestyle choices that dont lead to work.  Australians rightly expect that any subsidies students get are focused on areas of study most likely to improve employment outcomes, Minister Birmingham said.  Vocational education is a key feature of post-school learning in Australia and it is fundamental to our future success as we transition to a 21st century economy. But that means we also need to ensure that taxpayer support for students is targeted at skills that are in high demand and valued by employers.  These new statistics highlight that up to one in five students were doing VET FEE-HELP courses not to improve their job prospects, but to pursue lifestyle interests. While I understand some people may want to broaden their experiences, we need to ensure precious taxpayer money is used to support students doing courses with strong employment outcomes, which also increases the prospects of people paying back their government loan.  All diploma level courses were eligible under VET FEE-HELP, which meant we had a list of more than 800 courses being subsidised by taxpayers despite many being lifestyle focused with little relevance to employment outcomes.  With our new VET Student Loans program we will ensure providers go through a rigorous application process and extensive monitoring and evaluation to ensure they are delivering education that students and employers value and that taxpayers are willing to continue supporting.  VET Student Loans will only support legitimate students to undertake worthwhile and value-for-money courses at quality training providers.",1

"Residential Customers Seeing Lower Electric Bills Thanks to NatGas, EIA Says","Residential Customers Seeing Lower Electric Bills Thanks to NatGas, EIA Says Besides helping to lower carbon emissions, the continued growth of cheap natural gas-fired power generation in the United States in 2016 seems to be lowering residential electric bills as well.  Based on data collected through the first half of 2016, U.S. residential electricity prices are trending down for the first time in over a decade, according to the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) ""Today in Energy"" note published Thursday.  Through six months ""residential customers paid on average 12.4 cents/kWh, or 0.7% lower than the same period last year,"" EIA wrote. ""If this trend continues for the rest of 2016, annual average residential electricity prices would decline for the first time since 2002. Over the past five years, nominal residential prices have increased an average of 1.9% annually, about the same rate as overall inflation.""  Residential ratepayers ""in most areas of the country are seeing lower retail electricity prices this year compared with the same time last year,"" and the availability of cheap natural gas has been one of the main catalysts, EIA said. ""Over the first six months of 2016, the weighted average cost of natural gas delivered to electricity generators was $2.58/MMBtu, 28% lower than the first half of 2015.""  The New England region, coming off higher retail and wholesale power prices between 2013 and 2014, has seen residential prices fall by 6% through the first six months of 2016, averaging around 19.2 cents/kWh, EIA said. ""Improved supplies of natural gas into the region, along with lower natural gas prices, have contributed to the region's declining retail electricity rates so far in 2016.""  Noting a recent uptick in natural gas prices, EIA said its latest projections expect the average delivered cost of natural gas to be 27% higher in 2H2016 compared to 1H2016, with prices continuing to trend upward in 2017. Consequently, U.S. residential electricity prices are also expected to increase in 2017 by 3%, EIA said.  ""Not all recent declines in electricity prices can be attributed to developments in natural gas markets,"" EIA said. Hawaii, for example, uses petroleum in a number of its generating units, ""and the falling cost of crude oil has contributed to a 12% decline in retail electricity prices so far in 2016.""  After natural gas overtook coal's monthly share of U.S. electric generation for the first time in decades in 2015, power sector demand for gas has continued to increase in 2016 (see Daily GPI, Sept. 2).  The increased role of gas in the power stack has helped drive down greenhouse gas emissions, with U.S. carbon dioxide emissions falling below 2005 levels last year (see Daily GPI, May 9).  Even President Obama on Monday defended the role natural gas and unconventional shale development have played in addressing climate change (see Daily GPI, Oct. 4).

Help clients get the most from Medicare: Retirement Scan,"Help clients get the most from Medicare: Retirement Scan Our daily roundup of retirement news your clients may be thinking about.  Medicare recipients: Tips on getting what's yours  Many seniors fail to make the most of Medicare, as they don't understand how the program works, and they make the wrong decisions when choosing the coverage and timing their enrollment, according to this article in USA Today. ""People are used to employer health insurance and are surprised when they need to make all these complicated decisions for themselves when they move to Medicare. There often is no one to help them,"" says the expert. ""Medicare is so needlessly complicated that people often are paralyzed, cannot make a decision and thus do nothing."" One mistake people make is not switching their Medicare plans during the annual open enrollment period, which runs from Oct. 15 through Dec. 7 each year. Research shows that millions of people could find better coverage at lower cost if they took advantage of this ""terrific do over"" opportunity, an expert said.  How to defuse the tax bomb in your retirement plans  To minimize the tax bite on their savings and maximize after-tax income in retirement, clients may want to use a portion of their traditional IRA to buy a Qualifying Longevity Annuity Contract, according to this article on Forbes. They may also consider purchasing fixed and variable deferred annuities and investing in stocks, as dividends are taxed at a lower rate or not taxed depending on their tax bracket. Another option is to tap their home equity by applying for a reverse mortgage for tax-free income, or home equity line of credit with a tax-deductible interest.  Should you try to market-time your dollar-cost averaging strategy?  Retirement savers may want to consider a dollar-cost averaging strategy, which requires clients with a fixed amount of funds to follow a certain schedule for investing the money, according to this article on Motley Fool. ""I believe in dollar-cost averaging, rather than just waiting to have a huge lump sum and dumping it in, because what if then the market falls two weeks after that?"" says an expert. ""You've basically treated your entire savings as that one investment, rather than waiting until right after or right before and splitting it in half.""  Using 'brokerage window' to expand 401(k) options  401(k) participants who want to manage their own investments may want to use their employer's brokerage window, which allow employees to choose their investments from a broader menu of individual stocks and mutual funds, according to this article on CNBC. More employers are offering brokerage window to their workers. ""About 15 to 20% of our overall book of plans uses these, but 45 to 50% of the very large firms offer them,"" says an expert with Fidelity. ""The large plans have a level of sophistication from an administrative standpoint. They have educational programs and oversight that allows them to take that responsibility on.""",1
Landlords will face tougher tests from mortgage lenders,"News Landlords will face tougher tests from mortgage lenders Landlords will face tougher stress tests from mortgage lenders next year as the Bank of England attempts to bring the booming buy-to-let sector into line with the rest of the housing market.  For the first time, the Bank's Prudential Regulation Authority has implemented regulations that a landlord must meet to be given a mortgage.  The rules have been introduced to ensure landlords do not get into mortgage payment difficulties if interest rates were to climb sharply or if a landlord's income fell sharply.  However, some brokers have criticised the changes, arguing that they are an attack on small landlords who may struggle to pass the affordability tests.  ""This feels like the regulator is looking to, if not prosecute, then certainly rein in the buy-to-let market very, very hard,"" Simon Collins, at the mortgage broker John Charcol, said.  Richard Donnell, research director at the property analyst Hometrack, said that the regulations would require some landlords to find as much as Â£35,000 more of their own money to receive a mortgage.  Mr Donnell said: ""That's a lot of money. If you take it alongside the extra stamp duty costs for buy-to-let and the tax relief changes, then buy-to-let has gone from being a no-brainer for investors to forcing people to put more money in and minimise the risk. This may mean a slowdown in the buy-to-let market.""  The sector has enjoyed a boom in the past ten years. Some two million people are now private landlords, together renting out five million properties, according to Paragon, a mortgage lender.  Yet the Bank of England has been concerned for some time that the unregulated lending boom was a threat to the economy, arguing that a sudden sell-off of landlords' properties in an economic downturn would have a drastic effect on the housing market.  Landlords have already faced a tough year from regulators. In April, the government introduced an additional 3 per cent stamp duty surcharge on second homes and buy-to-let properties. George Osborne, the former chancellor, also reduced the tax relief landlords will be able to claim on mortgage payments from 2017.  Under the changes from the Bank of England, banks and specialist buy-to-let lenders will also be required to make sure that a landlord could still afford to meet their mortgage repayments if interest rates were to rise to 5.5 per cent over a minimum of five years.  The Bank's financial regulator will also ask lenders to assess whether a borrower's monthly rental income from a property is enough to cover their mortgage payments, or whether the landlord has enough of their own money to be able to keep paying the mortgage. This ratio will be 125 per cent so if a landlord's monthly mortgage costs are Â£1,000, then the rent they must receive is Â£1,250 a month.",1
Long-term care delay post-fire frustrates seniors,"News Long-term care delay post-fire frustrates seniors The leadership of Fort McMurray's leading seniors' advocacy group says further delaying a planned longterm care facility during the rebuild ""goes beyond common sense.""  During a Monday meeting of the municipality's Land Planning and Transportation Committee, it was announced development of the long-term care facility was stalled.  Council is willing to commit $10.5 million to the project as soon as the province reaches out to the advisory committee on aging. The municipality is still awaiting a response, and administration says the delay is an example of the wildfire's fallout slowing bureaucracy.  Joan Furber, president of the Golden Years Society, said in May she hoped the project would not be forgotten during the rebuilding process. Now, she says many seniors are back to wondering when any progress on the project will be made.  ""When I read what happened, my mouth jus t dropped,"" she said. ""Is the message that people have to work here for decades then leave town when they're old?  How much of a priority do we have to be?"" Last November, the province announced the long-term care facility planned for Parsons Creek would be moved to Willow Square, the site seniors had said they preferred. Consultation would be held over the next year to influence the design phase.  At the time, the province estimated a four-year wait for a Willow Square facility to open, factoring in time for consultation, design and construction.  ""This is the year they should have been consulting overtime with our community,""  says Tany Yao, Wildrose MLA for Fort McMurray-Wood Buffalo. ""We know they have the money for it in the provincial budget, there's no reason why they can't still be doing those meetings with us right now.""  Shortly after the city reopened, Furber says the message from municipal and provincial officials would be that development of Willow Square could be delayed up to a year. She says few seniors had an issue with that and understood the circumstances. Yet, there was still an expectation that consultation would continue in some form.  ""So much has happened in the last few months, we get that things are going to be a little late,"" she says. ""It's just there seems to be an excuse for everything. When I was told things would be slower, and again I understood that, we were also told not to worry.""  The bureaucratic fallout of the wildfire has also delayed construction and consultation for several other capital projects, the committee was told. These include the Conklin Multiplex and the redevelopment of expropriated land in downtown Fort McMurray.  vmcdermott@postmedia.com  Olivia Condon, Fort Mcmurray Today, Postmedia Network / The large sign promoting an aging in place facility, what would have been Willow Square, sits vacant more than three years since the sign was erected on the corner of Franklin Ave. and Hospital Street in Fort McMurray Alta., September 27, 2016.;",1
Keys to keeping lid on spending,"Money Keys to keeping lid on spending Her Money  Each week Fairfax personal finance editor Sally Patten will point out the steps women can take to secure their financial future.  If you are not across your household's financial statements, you should be.  That is the advice of Claire Mackay, an adviser at Quantum Financial.  The reason is simple. ""If you don't know where you spend money, you won't know where you can save."" And why is this so important?  You might think that being wealthy, or at least comfortably off, depends on what you earn, but in fact, argues this financial adviser, there is more to it. Being wealthy depends on how much you spend.  ""My wealthiest clients know exactly where all their money goes,"" Mackay says. She adds that invariably clients can find ways to reduce their spending if they need to, even if it is changing to a cheaper mobile phone plan or reviewing their electricity, gas or insurance arrangements.  There are two things you need to understand about your finances. The first is the so-called balance sheet, which shows what investments you own and how much debt, or borrowings, you have.  The investments might be an investment property, shares, money in a bank account or superannuation savings. The debt you owe might be a mortgage, any debt on your credit cards or other car or personal loans.  The balance sheet part is important when it comes to retirement because you will need to rely on these investments to support you when you are no longer earning a salary.  The other area of your finances that you should be on top of is the day-to-day stuff; in other words, your monthly or annual income and your expenses.  When you think of your salary, don't think about it in gross terms, but the amount you receive after tax and super contributions have been deducted - your net salary.  When calculating your expenses, you should include everything from groceries and your daily coffee bill to your expenditure on rates, entertainment, clothing, car insurance and your telecommunications.  Longer term, the idea is to arrange your income and expenses in such a way to allow you to shift the money you receive via your salary to the investments that appear on the household balance sheet - although in the shorter term the money may be shifted to separate holiday or school fee accounts.  Once you are retired, you won't want to have much debt hanging around, so the idea is to gradually pay down borrowings.  The bottom line is you need to understand your financial position - what is going on in terms of your assets and borrowings, income and expenses. Ultimately you need to know if you are converting income into assets.The information in this article should not be taken as financial advice.

How Much Retirement Income Will You Need? Maybe Less Than You Think; New research calls the venerable 80% income-replacement rule into...,"Life How Much Retirement Income Will You Need? Maybe Less Than You Think; New research calls the venerable 80% income-replacement rule into question New research indicates that retirees-especially in higher income brackets-might need to replace less of their pre-retirement income than they think.  Financial planners have long suggested that individuals replace 80% of their income in retirement from various sources to maintain the same standard of living they had while working.  But in a recent article in Research magazine, Michael Finke, a professor at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, notes that the rule doesn't necessarily reflect how a person's income grows while he or she is working-nor how expenses change and even decline in retirement. What's more, the guideline focuses on gross income rather than take-home pay.  Consider: In retirement, you likely no longer contribute to Social Security, Medicare and your retirement account. That means your replacement rate is down to no more than 77% of your final year's salary-or 60% or less if you use average lifetime income, Prof. Finke says.  If you subtract other expenses-commuting and a lower federal income-tax bill (assuming you're in a lower tax bracket in retirement than you were in your working years)-the replacement rate falls lower still.  ""The 80% rule is wrong because it's too simplistic,"" Prof. Finke says. ""Most of us don't want to replace our gross income. We want to replace our paycheck.""  The guideline, he adds, is especially distorted for high-income Americans.  ""The highest 20% of earners aren't even spending half of their gross income,"" he says. ""So if you think they need 80% of their gross income, then they'd have to spend more in retirement than they'd ever spent during their working years-and this doesn't sound like a good life plan.""  So, what's a better way to figure out how much income you need?  First, if you're at, or very near, retirement, you can use your actual target consumption, says David Blanchett, head of retirement research at Morningstar Investment Management, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chicago-based fund-research company Morningstar Inc. For those still several years or more from leaving the office, the key is pinpointing what specific expenses will change at retirement and adjusting one's replacement rate accordingly. ""A household that is saving 20% of their pay, for example, in a 401(k) needs to replace a lower percentage of their final pay than one saving only 5% because they are used to living off less,"" Mr. Blanchett says.  Prof. Finke adds: ""Most of the wealthiest retirees don't spend down their money at all. This means that if they didn't want to give it to their kids they could have had a lot more fun when they were younger.""  Mr. Powell is the editor of Retirement Weekly, a service of MarketWatch.com.

Health Care on a Budget,"UpFront Health Care on a Budget The impact medical costs will have in retirement.  ""We talk about all aspects of what participants will need in retirement,"" says Michael Woomer, senior vice president of institutional and retirement plan services at Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh. ""People basically understand they will be facing health care costs, but they don't understand how big the impact will be, so we tell participants how important it is to save as much as they can.""  A recent report from the National Association of Government Defined Contribution (DC) Administrators estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring today should expect to spend $220,000 on health care over the course of a 20-year retirement. Woomer says the costs could range from $150,000 to $400,000.  It is far more important for plan advisers to discuss health care costs in retirement than it is to talk about lifestyle goals, says Mary McDougall, a Merrill Lynch financial adviser in St. Paul, Minnesota. The premiums and out-of-pocket expenses will range from $10,000 to $20,000 a year, she says. ""The expenses are a lot more than they expect.""  ""I would hope that advisers are not refraining from having this conversation,"" says Scott Laue, a financial adviser with Savant Capital Management in Rockford, Illinois. ""As a certified financial planner [CFP], we are required to disclose both the good and the bad.""  The trend toward high-deductible health care plans paired with health savings accounts (HSAs) is bringing the subject of health care costs-pre- and post-retirement-to the fore, says Shelby George, vice president, adviser services, at Manning & Napier in Rochester, New York. Just like the movement from pensions to defined contribution plans, employers are moving toward high-deductible plans, which put more of the onus on participants, and ""are encouraging advisers to talk about [those coming expenses] more in their education materials.""  Advisers are also increasingly encouraging participants to invest in HSAs. ""This is one area that participants can use to save above and beyond the retirement plan,"" Woomer says.  Even for participants with more than $5 million in liquid assets-the market advised by Frank Migliazzo, managing director, private wealth advisers at Merrill Lynch in Troy, Michigan-health care costs are a concern. Migliazzo notes that Merrill Lynch research has found that, over the last 30 years, health care costs have risen an average of 6 percentage points above inflation each year.  Merrill Lynch has also found that many people will end up in a nursing home, he adds. For 65-year-olds, there is a 15% chance they will need to be placed in a care facility. At age 85, that possibility rises to 55%, and at age 90, it increases to 70%. Migliazzo's clients are also worried about dementia. As a result, many are buying long-term-care insurance.  The report found that Medicare covers 62% of health care costs, but the individual is responsible for the remaining 38%.",1
I'm a first-time buyer confused by mortgage options,"Money I'm a first-time buyer confused by mortgage options I've been offered a few interest rates and wonder how fixing the rates would affect my mortgage  Q I'm currently looking for a mortgage to buy my first house and I'm very confused as there are so many options.  I have a few mortgage advisers offering me interest rates of between 4.8% and 5.2% for a five-year fixed rate. Are these good?  Is it better to fix it for shorter period and pay a lower interest rate? If I fix it for two years, will the interest rate go up? AP  A On the face of it, those interest rates seem pretty high especially given the fact that we've been enjoying several months of record low fixed interest rates.  Even if you got a mortgage of 90% of the value of a property, financial firm Moneyfacts says you could get a five-year fixed rate of 3.39% from Yorkshire Bank and a slightly higher 3.79% from Post Office Money. These are both a lot lower than the rates that you have been quoted.  However, if the figures of 4.8% and 5.2% that you have given are annual percentage rates (APR), they don't seem so bad. The APR gives you a way of comparing mortgage deals which takes into account all the costs of the mortgage including fees as well as the mortgage interest rate and the rate that the mortgage will revert to once the fixed rate is over. The APR for the Yorkshire Bank deal - which has an arrangement fee of Â£999 - is 4.5% while the APR on the Post Office Money offering - which has no fee - is 4.3%.  You are right in thinking that you'll be charged a lower rate of interest if you fix for a shorter amount of time. Again with a 90% mortgage, if you fixed for just two years, you would pay 2.39% with the Yorkshire Bank and 2.49% at the Loughborough building society.  The APRs are higher at 4.6% and 4.7% respectively, and if you only fix for two years you may have to pay a fee for a new deal afterwards, so the overall cost could be cheaper on a five-year deal.  Going for the shorter fix doesn't make it more likely that the interest rate will go up. Interest rates will go up or down whether you fix for two years or five. The question you need to ask yourself is whether you want the certainty of knowing that your mortgage payments won't change for five years or whether you are happy to take a gamble that interest rates generally won't have risen - as they are generally predicted to do - by too much in two years' time.

Will apathy risks family losing their inheritance,"Will apathy risks family losing their inheritance TWO-THIRDS of adults have not made enough provision for their legacy to be left to whom they choose, according to a wills and probate specialist.  One in four over-65s are still to make a will [GETTY/ picture posed by model]  Research from the Co-operative Legal Services also found one in four over-65s are still to make a will.Â   These individuals risk losing control of their estate and their final wishes for savings, assets and investments not being met.Â   These findings come as the rules of intestacy, which decree what happens to a person's estate if they die with no valid will in place, today change for the first time since 1925.  Experts say the new rules should simplify how an estate is distributed in the event someone dies without having the right paperwork in place but they also serve as a timely reminder of the importance of drawing up and maintaining a will.Â   The key differences include changes for couples who are married or in a civil partnership. They will now inherit the entire estate if a partner dies without a will and they have no children or other descendants.Â   However, this change does not apply to unmarried couples who will not automatically have rights to an estate if a partner dies without a will.Â   Other moves include changes to the inheritance of an estate for married couples of civil partners with children and protection for children adopted after the death of a parent. Under old rules there was a risk children in this situation would lose their inheritance but under the new rules, a child of the deceased can inherit on intestacy even if they're subsequently adopted.Â   ""It's pleasing that rule changes have simplified matters but if a person dies without a valid will in place, they still have no control over what happens to their estate,"" warns James Antoniou, head of wills for the CLS.Â   ""To ensure your estate goes to those you want, it's crucial you have a will."" Andrew Caplen of the Law Society agrees that the rule changes serve as a reminder of the importance of a will.Â   ""If you have no will it means your final wishes may go unheeded and a financial and emotional mess is left for your loved ones to sort out,"" he said.Â   If you want to make a will it is worth noting that anyone can set themselves up as a will-writer.Â   ""It is important that people are able to distinguish between those who are unregulated, uninsured and untrained and trained solicitors who specialise in this area,"" added Caplen.Â   To find a registered solicitor that specialises in wills and probate visit Solicitors.LawSociety.org.uk.

New report reveals older worker hotspots and the vast differences in employment prospects for over 50s around the country,"News New report reveals older worker hotspots and the vast differences in employment prospects for over 50s around the country Watford, Dorset and the Shetland Islands are leading the charge against 'outdated' older worker stereotypes, a Government report revealed today.  According the figures released by the Department for Work and Pensions, Watford has the highest rate of employment among older workers, with nine out of 10 people aged 50-64 in work.  In the Shetlands this rate is 88 per cent while in north Dorset it's 87 per cent, closely followed by Stroud in Gloucestershire and Horsham in Sussex.  DWP minister Steve Webb said: 'The business case for ignoring outdated and inaccurate stereotypes and giving older workers a chance to thrive is absolutely compelling, and these figures  show that in some parts of the country that message is being received loud and clear.  'What we must do now is extend the positive record we're seeing in counties like Hertfordshire across the whole of the UK.'  But the report also highlighted a number of employment blackspots for older workers.  Almost half of people aged 50-64 were unemployed in Hyndburn and Rossendale in Lancashire, 50 per cent in London's Tower Hamlets, and 51 per cent in Barrow-in-Furness.  'JOB PROSPECTS FOR YOUNG ARE IMPROVING'  Two-thirds of employers have hired a young person in the past year, according to a survey of 600 employers.  The Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) said this positive outlook is set to continue for the rest of the year, with employers focussing more on candidate's attitude rather than exam results.  Rec chief executive Kevin Green said: 'It's the best time in six years to be a young person coming into the jobs market.'  This resonates with data released by the Office for National Statistics last week suggesting that ageism in the workplace is still rife.  Unemployment as a whole fell to 6.4 per cent last quarter and the number of unemployed people aged 16-49 fell 18.8 per cent since May 2010, compared to just 5.3 per cent for those aged 50-64.  Dr Ros Altmann, the former director general of Saga, who was appointed last month as the Government's Business Champion for Older Workers, said more needed to be done to help people in this age group, such as offering apprentice schemes.  'It does seem there remains latent ageism in the labour market,' she said. 'Not enough is being done to help these people back to work and overcome ageist attitudes.'  And with retirement at the age of 65 looking increasingly unfeasible for most workers, employment equality is essential if they're to top up their dwindling pension pot.  Steve Webb added: 'Another crucial point is that a person dropping out of the workforce early can have a devastating effect on their retirement income. We owe it to people to do everything possible to ensure they can benefit from a full working life.'",1
Charge Cards vs. Debit Cards,"Charge Cards vs. Debit Cards Not all plastic cards are created equal.  When discussing the kind of credit that comes with a plastic card, the first distinction to make is between charge cards and credit cards. American Express Green Card and Gold Card and Diners Club Charge Card are charge cards that require you to pay your bill in full each billing cycle. Most credit cards (including some offered by companies that also issue charge cards) don't necessarily encourage you to pay your bill in full because they profit by charging interest -- lots of interest -- on the unpaid balance.  Charge cards. Travel and entertainment cards, such as American Express and Diners Club, are charge cards, not credit cards. You are expected to pay their bills in full within a specified time period. If you don't, you'll be penalized.  Membership fees for charge cards are higher than for bank-issued cards, and the kinds of service they offer -- an annual accounting of charges, traveler's checks, cash in an emergency -- are commonly available with credit cards, too, especially gold or platinum cards.  You may be able to get a bigger credit line with a charge card, but they're not as widely accepted as Visa or MasterCard.  Debit cards. A debit card appears to work the same way as a credit card: The merchant runs it through a little machine and off you go without any cash actually changing hands. But that's where the similarity ends. When you use a debit card, the amount of your purchase is deducted from your checking account or some other account you have designated. It's useful to think of a debit card as a paperless check that clears immediately, with no grace period, or ""float.""  If you're not paying close attention, you may find yourself carrying a debit card from your bank that you think is a credit card. That mistake usually lasts no longer than the arrival of your first bank statement showing your depleted balance.  The main use for debit cards used to be to get cash from automated teller machines, but devices known as point of sale terminals have been installed in an increasing number of retail outlets. Beginning in August (July for new accounts), your bank will ask if you want to opt-in for overdraft protection. If you don't, your transaction will be declined. This will also occur at the ATM.  Two key facts to remember about debit cards:  Although they look like credit cards, they aren't.  Safeguards against loss or theft and unauthorized use of your card aren't as strict as they are with credit cards. By law, you're liable for the same $50 as with a credit card, but only if you report an unauthorized transaction within two business days of discovering it. Miss that deadline and you're legally responsible for up to $500. But MasterCard and Visa will waive it entirely in many cases.  Copyright 2013 The Kiplinger Washington Editors",1
"Why divorce is bad for a man's health: Separation increases the risk of early death, substance abuse, suicide and depression","Health Why divorce is bad for a man's health: Separation increases the risk of early death, substance abuse, suicide and depression * The impact of divorce on men's health 'needs urgent investigation'  * Divorced men are more likely to have heart disease, high blood pressure and strokes than married ones - are also 39% more likely to commit suicide  * They are more likely to take part in risky activities which also increases their mortality rate  Divorce might leave some with a broken heart but it also causes real health problems for men, according to researchers.  Those whose marriages end have higher rates of mortality, substance abuse and depression and often lack social support, a study found.  It called for doctors to refer more male divorcees to therapists and said more work is 'urgently needed' to investigate the damaging effects of relationship break-ups on their health.  American researchers say that divorced and single menÂ have a 39 per cent higher suicide rate than their married counterparts - perhaps in part because they are more likely to engage in risky behaviour.  The study, published in the Journal of Men's Health, calls for doctors to refer more men to therapists.  A case study by Dr Daniel Felix, of the University of Nebraska, said health professionals must recognise 'divorce related health problems' in men.  His research centred on a 45-year-old white man who 'endured a difficult divorce'.  He visited his family doctor for the first time in ten years complaining of bad sleep and persistent abdominal pain.  The man revealed he drank 'about a six-pack of beer a day,' had recently begun hating his job in middle management at a local bank and had become irritated with his colleagues and boss.  He eventually reported having limited access to his children and paying a 'significant amount of child support'.  The man also said his ex-wife 'took all our friends with her after the divorce'.  The researchers reported the man's physical condition as 'unremarkable' apart from having a slightly enlarged liver and being somewhat overweight.  They instead attributed his mild physical ailments and seemingly mild depressive state to continued anxiety and stress associated with his divorce.  As a result, the researchers warn doctors about treating ailments that have a psychological basis in divorce.  Instead, they recommend nutrition, exercise and sleep education.  They also urge medical professionals to refer men to alcohol and substance abuse treatment programmes, counsellors or other mental health professionals or divorce support groups.  Professor Ridwan Shabsigh, of Cornell University in the U.S. and president of the International Society of Men's Health, said: 'Popular perception, and many cultures as well as the media, present men as tough, resilient, and less vulnerable to psychological trauma than women.  'The fact is men get affected substantially by psychological trauma and negative life events such as divorce, bankruptcy, war and bereavement.  'Research is urgently needed to investigate the prevalence and impact of such effects and to develop diagnosis and treatment guidelines for practitioners.'",1
FEAR FOR ELDERLY WITH MORTGAGE DEBT,"FEAR FOR ELDERLY WITH MORTGAGE DEBT Fears have been raised for elderly people who are still sitting on large amounts of mortgage debt and could be at risk of losing their homes.  A report by Bristol University and the International Longevity Centre (ILC-UK) found that about two-fifths (40%) of people aged 75 and over and who still have a mortgage to pay off have an interest only mortgage with no linked investment with which to pay their loan back. This figure dropped to just 6% for people aged between 50 and 54 who still have a mortgage.  Interest-only mortgages, which allow borrowers to pay off the capital only when the mortgage term ends, have become much more thin on the ground since the boom years amid concerns about people not being able to pay back their debt.  Earlier this year, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) found that home owners have been failing to put enough money aside on up to half of the 2.6 million interest-only mortgages which are due for repayment over the next 30 years.  Mortgage lenders recently agreed to alert their most at-risk customers to help them avoid ""payment shocks''. Some borrowers could end up having to sell their home to pay the loan back if they do not take stronger control of their repayment planning.  The Bristol University/ILC-UK research found that nearly one in 10 (9%) households headed by someone aged in their late 60s still had a mortgage to pay off, as did one in 50 (2%) of people aged over 80.  Among everyone aged over 50 with an outstanding mortgage, the average amount still owed was Â£62,200. Among the over 75s, the average amount outstanding was Â£30,900.  At least 14% of older mortgaged households had taken on a new home loan or extended their mortgage in the last couple of years, the report found.  The research was based on the Office for National Statistics' Wealth and Assets Survey, which looked at the economic wellbeing of households.  Peter Tutton, head of policy at StepChange Debt Charity, said: ""Today's report further highlights the potentially serious problems faced by older people with interest only mortgages.  ""It is now essential that lenders show forbearance and work with customers to establish suitable options to prevent people from losing their homes in retirement.""  Andrea Finney of Bristol University's Personal Finance Research Centre, said: ""These new findings highlight a core of households whose mortgages have persisted into older age.""  She said the report raises important questions about the financial security of these households as they approach later life.  David Sinclair, assistant director of policy and communications at ILC-UK said: ""We are seeing a worrying picture emerge of older people with unlinked interest only mortgages.  ""As the FCA and industry communicates with people with unlinked interest only mortgages, it should evaluate whether any specific targeting of information and advice is necessary for older people.""  ends",1
Don't be afraid to ask the difficult questions that come with retirement planning,"News Don't be afraid to ask the difficult questions that come with retirement planning Planning for retirement can be overwhelming. It requires thinking about long-term goals and it forces consideration of a more sensitive subject -- one's own mortality.  An RBC study reports that only 52% of Canadian boomers actually put a plan on paper despite understanding its importance. However, they worry about it. According to a recent Investors Group survey, financial concerns affect 32% of Canadian couples and 60% of them put retirement savings worries at the top of the list.  For many Canadians, a sense of futility comes from thinking ""I'll never be able to save enough money."" They might be influenced by the old rule of thumb that suggests 70% of pre-retirement income is needed to maintain a current standard of living.  However, some experts like Fred Vettese, the chief actuary of Morneau Shepell, believe that figure is far too high.  Determining the right figure starts with analysis. Cash flow models should be performed, accounting for such factors as lump sum cash needs for special events, future inflation and debt reduction.  To help with that process, the government of Canada has created an excellent Canadian Retirement Income Calculator that takes into account such things as CPP, pensions, RRSPs and other sources of income like annuities.  Once income goals have been set, an analysis should be done to determine the income sources. For most people, a substantial portion will be drawn from investment portfolios. As retirement nears, these portfolios should be prepared for the transition and structured to replace employment income. This generally translates into a more significant weighting in fixed income as well as other investments that provide a regular income stream, such as high quality dividend-paying investments.  Good retirement income plans will also make use of guaranteed income sources that guard against volatile markets and inflation erosion. These include government benefits, available pension income and annuities.  Proper retirement planning goes beyond the management of the retirement portfolio. Estate planning also enters the picture, both from the perspective of how the money will be distributed to heirs but also to more sensitive personal issues. Often there is concern over the future management of the estate by the heirs who may not be competent with finances or are simply not ready to handle a large inheritance.  Canadians want to retire with sufficient income to carry them through and, hopefully, with enough to leave something for their children. However, if they allow themselves to be overwhelmed in angst over an unattainable figure that is both too high and inaccurate, they will never be motivated to begin saving. Determining the right number takes time, but the time is well spent.  -Kim Inglis, CIM, PFP, FCSI, AIFP is an Investment Adviser and Portfolio Manager with Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, a division of Canaccord Genuity Corp., Member -Canadian Investor Protection Fund. www.reynoldsinglis.ca.

Compulsory pension for West workers,"News Compulsory pension for West workers Around 677,000 workers in the South West will automatically pay into a company pension under Government plans to avert mass hardship in retirement.  From October 1, staff working for large firms and not currently in a workplace scheme will see pay reduced by 1%, with the cash placed into savings and matched by the employer.  The move will affect people earning more than the income tax threshold, which is currently Â£8,105. Small firms will not be involved until June 2015 at the earliest.  In the greater South West, just 41% of private sector workers, or 471,000 people, make payments into a workplace pension scheme. The figure has fallen sharply since 2002, when 57% paid into a company scheme.  The number of private sector workers paying into pension schemes has plummeted to its lowest level since records began in 1953.  Around nine-in-ten public sector workers have a staterun scheme, meaning the reform will largely affect the private sector.  The automatic enrolment scheme, which has been described as the biggest pensions shake-up in more than a century, aims to tackle concerns about a growing old age poverty crisis, as people are living for longer but failing to put away enough for their later years.  Workers can choose to opt out of the scheme once they have been enrolled under ""soft compulsion"". The Government believes less than onethird will opt-out. Employers will eventually contribute 3% of earnings, individuals 4% of earnings, and there will also be 1% from the Government to make up a total contribution of 8%.  Pensions Minister Steve Webb told the Western Morning News: ""We've got millions and millions of people who don't have a pension, so when they retire they will get a pension from the state and not much else. They will be on a very low standard of living in retirement. ""If we do nothing, fewer and fewer people will have a workbased pensions and will retire into poverty. We can't really think of any other way of enabling these millions of workers to retire with a decent standard of living. We could force them to save, which reduces the freedom of choice. We could tax everybody and have a much higher state pension.  This seems to us the right balance.""  Asked whether the timing was inconvenient as Britain remains in recession and households are struggling to pay bills, he said: ""There's never a great time to do this. It's already been delayed quite significantly. It's been talked about for years and years.""  Anne Marie Morris, Conservative MP for Newton Abbot, chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Micro Businesses, said she was pleased so many South West workers would be paying into a pension.

Three Tips For Building A Lasting Retirement,"Three Tips For Building A Lasting Retirement MILWAUKEE, Sept. 18, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Retirement planning is constantly changing making it necessary to have a solid retirement strategy. In the past, many could rely on pension plans and social security benefits, but pension plans are increasingly rare(1) and Social Security benefits should not be used as a sole source of retirement.  Many Americans are at risk of running out of money in retirement. According to a recent Employee Benefit Research Institute study (EBRI), nearly 47 percent of early baby boomers (ages 56 to 62) are at risk of outliving their retirement savings. ""To develop a sustainable strategy that meets your specific needs, some important considerations would be your age at retirement, life expectancy, living expenses and the rate of return you expect from your investments,"" said Dean Urbanski, Vice President, BMO Harris Financial Advisors, Inc., a part of BMO Financial Group.  Here are a few tips from Urbanksi on planning for retirement.      -- Withdrawal Strategy: Knowing how much money should be withdrawn from your        retirement savings each year is a critical factor in building a        retirement plan. Withdraw too much and you are likely to outlive your        assets; take too little and you may unnecessarily sacrifice your standard        of living, especially in the early years of retirement.       -- Asset Allocation: As individuals seek increased income upon entering        retirement, they often shift their holdings more toward bonds and cash.        This may or may not be a good move, as there are other key investment        considerations beyond having a need for income. Confer with your        financial advisor to determine the appropriate allocation for your needs,        investment objective, risk profile and timeframe.       -- A core of guaranteed income: In retirement your focus will need to shift        to using your savings to generate income to meet your ongoing expenses.        One possible option is to allocate a portion of your savings to an        annuity. Annuities are an investment tool that can provide guaranteed        income for the rest of your life, no matter how long you live.   Said Urbanksi, ""Whatever your specific plans, it's crucial that you enter retirement with a strategy for turning your savings into a retirement 'paycheck' that will allow you to live retirement on your own terms.""

"California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform","News; News California's Brown signs pension bill, cites it as historic reform California Gov. Jerry Brown has signed a hotly contested pension reform bill whose impact on public employees may signal a new era in DB and health care coverage nationwide.  Reuters notes that Brown's new legislation will raise the minimum retirement ages for many public employees as well as reducing pension benefits for all new workers.  ""Under the new rules, employers and employees alike are going to contribute their fair share of the costs, resulting in a more sustainable system,"" Brown said, in a statement. The law, he adds, is the ""biggest rollback to public pensions in the history of California pensions.""  California's new rules come admit tremendous economic and political pressure to curtail the escalating costs of DB plans and post-retirement benefits for public employees, both in that state and across the U.S.  But California's pressures have been stronger, with several major cities claiming or teetering on the verge of bankrupcy as they find it impossible to meet their pension obligations, in part due to long-term national economic issues.  The state's two biggest pension funds, the California Public Employees' Retirement System and the California State Teachers' Retirement System, are at least $165 million underfunded.  And normally left-leaning, worker-friendly cities including San Jose and San Diego have also joined the fray, with voters supporting measures to limit pension benefits for existing workers and retirees and drastically reduce services to new hires - votes which are being contested in court by public safety employee unions.  Under Brown's new legistlation, new hires will evenly split payments to their pension accounts with their employers, and other government employers will have more leverage to ask the same of current employees, upping their required contributions. Park rangers, game wardens and firefighters will now have to pay more of their own benefits.  The legislation also launches new formulas for calculating future pension benefits for new employees.  As a spin-off to the pension legislation, Moody's Investors Service said the action will go far to increasing California's overall credit rating, currently listed as A1.  The Associated Press notes that the bill did not include a hybrid-styled system Brown had championed which would add a 401(k)-style system so public employees would bear some of the investment risk, as private-sector workers do.  As well, nothing was done to contain the health care costs promised to retiring workers, and there are still no indendent members with financial experties on the board of the state's main pension fund.  ""Yes, it's not everything. It's not perfection,"" Brown told reporters in Los Angeles. ""But in politics we don't deal with perfection. These are hard fought. These aren't that easy.""  California's public employees' system estimates the changes will save between $42 billion and $50 billion over 30 years, while the teachers' system estimated its savings at $22.7 billion over 30 years.",1
"Banking, Financial Services; Prudential reports higher rate taxpayers reject (GBP)438 million in tax relief","Banking, Financial Services; Prudential reports higher rate taxpayers reject (GBP)438 million in tax relief 2012 SEP 8 (VerticalNews) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Investment Weekly News -- One in four higher rate taxpayers do not contribute to pension schemes despite the attraction of tax relief to help boost their retirement savings, according to independent research from Prudential*. Nationally, this equates to around 216,000 employees missing out on up to (GBP)438 million a year in pension tax relief.  The nationwide study of those earning between (GBP)42,275 and (GBP)149,999 found 21 per cent claiming they cannot afford to contribute to a pension scheme. One in eight (13 per cent) say they do not see the point of saving for retirement, despite the tax benefits of pensions, while 17 per cent don't know why they fail to save into a pension scheme.  An average higher rate taxpayer contributing (GBP)425 a month into a pension fund receives basic rate tax relief of (GBP)85 a month or (GBP)1,020 a year, directly into their pension fund. Up to an additional (GBP)1,020 a year in higher rate tax relief can be claimed, which could also be used for pension saving.  Figures from HMRC show that around 58 per cent of the estimated 900,000 higher rate taxpayers in the UK contribute to defined contribution pension schemes, while another 15 per cent are members of either non-contributory or defined benefit schemes.  But despite earning average salaries of (GBP)58,541, the rest do not save into pension schemes at all. Around 43 per cent of those who don't save into a pension scheme claim to have made alternative retirement arrangements, 4 per cent have existing Self-Invested Personal Pension schemes and another 2 per cent claim they will not retire.  Matthew Stephens, Prudential's tax expert, said: ""Pension saving offers valuable tax reliefs to all workers and particularly to higher rate taxpayers. Basic rate 20 per cent tax relief is available at source plus up to an extra 20 per cent from HMRC for higher rate taxpayers. Turning down what is effectively free money simply does not make sense.  ""It is worrying that so many higher rate taxpayers say they cannot afford to save into a pension despite earning healthy salaries. The good news is that it is never too late to take action on saving for retirement and we urge all workers to seek advice on long-term retirement planning""  The Prudential research shows that recent changes limiting annual tax-free pension contributions to (GBP)50,000 a year have not significantly dented pension saving among higher earners. Just 8 per cent said the change had put them off pension saving while 25 per cent were unaware of the change.

Should I use lump sum to pay off mortgage or save for children's studies?,"Should I use lump sum to pay off mortgage or save for children's studies? Ask the experts: Should I use my inheritance to pay off my mortgage or save for my children's university years?  Q I am in my 50s, semi-retired, with Â£70,000 outstanding on my repayment mortgage which will be paid off by 2017 at the latest (I am currently overpaying). I also have two children of 15 and 13 who will be hoping to go to university.  I am in the fortunate position of being about to inherit Â£60k later this year and wondered if I should repay my mortgage with the lump sum and use what would have been mortgage repayment money to save for university fees or would it be better to simply invest Â£30k each for the children now in a trust fund for their education? Or maybe half and half? If I did pay off the mortgage, what kind of product should I invest in? All the ISAs I currently have for them have nearly halved in value and I am reluctant to use them.  My husband and I will be earning (hopefully) for the next four years at least to pay the mortgage off but after that we will go onto pensions which, while relatively generous (half salary), will not allow us to subsidise our children's university education at that time. We need to save now. AT  A Because you are likely to be paying a higher rate of interest on your mortgage than on your savings, I would be tempted to use the Â£60,000 to help clear the loan and start building up a fund for your children.  Given the time scale involved, it is probably best to stick to low-risk investments where the value of the money you save will not fluctuate. So that means some form of cash savings. If you can commit to regular saving - which you should be able to do - you can earn pretty good rates of interest with the regular savings accounts from Nottingham, Principality, Stroud & Swindon and Buckinghamshire building societies. They pay 5%, 4.5%, 4.5% and 4.12% respectively. Alternatively, you could save in a cash ISA and/or the range of cash savings from National Savings & Investments.  It is also worth bearing in mind that when your children to go to university, paying their fees up front for them may not be the best thing to do. The fact that students can get heavily subsidised loans to pay their fees can mean that it is better to take the cheap loan to pay for fees. In addition, if you and your husband will be living on a much-reduced income by that children, the means test of parental income may mean that they qualify for a non-repayable grant.

Cloud of debt lifted through financial coaching program,"Cloud of debt lifted through financial coaching program Maggie San Miguel spent years living in fear.  The 47-year-old Austin woman couldn't answer the telephone. She refused to open her mailbox. She couldn't deal with the debt collectors constantly hounding her for the tens of thousands of dollars in debt she had accumulated. So she just ignored them.  She couldn't sleep. She drank to forget everything, she said.  ""Eventually you're just frozen,"" San Miguel said. ""It gets worse and worse and worse. You're just running all the time.""  Then 18 months ago , San Miguel connected with Foundation Communities. She learned how to get her finances under control.  ""It's so freeing,"" she said. ""I've never experience such empowerment. It's amazing.""  Foundation Communities is an Austin-based nonprofit well known for renting affordable apartments and duplexes across the city. Its community tax centers, which provide tax preparation services for low-income people and facilitated $25 million in tax refunds last year, also gets the spotlight. The tax center program is available to individuals making less than $25,000 annually and families earning less than $50,000 per year. Those centers are currently open, and more information is available at www.foundcom.org .  What's less known is the nonprofit's financial coaching programs, which teach people how to set a budget, save money, reduce debt and repair credit. For some people, that coaching is the first time they've ever been taught how to manage their finances, said Katie Hazekamp , a community outreach associate for Foundation Communities.  ""We don't have any financial information incorporated into our education and then we're just supposed to know how to do it,"" she said.  San Miguel did know how to do it. She'd worked in accounting and business for years, she said. But after a five divorces and a bout with breast cancer, San Miguel, who has one son, found herself deeply in debt.  Even though she was working, she couldn't pay off her bills, she said. She didn't know that she could negotiate with creditors or that she should scour her credit report for possible mistakes.  Instead, overwhelmed, she ignored everything. She avoided her mailbox for weeks to avoid the threatening letters.  ""Sometimes, the mailman would leave notes in my mailbox saying, 'You know. . . ,' "" San Miguel said.  In 2008 , while looking for a new place to live, she stumbled across several South Austin duplexes owned by Foundation Communities. She got financial coaching and learned how to attack her debt. And she realized that fear had been her biggest barrier to financial recovery.  Now, San Miguel said, she is paying her bills on time and working with her creditors to pay off her bills. She's learning about financial programs that could allow her to eventually buy her own home.  She answers her phone. She opens her mailbox.  ""It's monumental,"" she said.

"Labor helps union, nonunion jobless","Editorial Labor helps union, nonunion jobless By Mark Gaffney  Today's unions are changing to be more relevant to working families. While workers need unions for all of the same reasons they have always needed them - family-supporting jobs, living wages, access to health care and secure retirement plans - they also need help overcoming unemployment.  The economic situation in Michigan and across our nation is crushing some struggling families. When individuals lose their jobs, not only is their usual source of income gone, but also their personal work relationships, daily structures and an important sense of self-purpose.  Unemployment can be, and often is, a shock to the whole system, leading to the same feelings and stresses experienced with other major losses. That's why the Michigan AFL-CIO has created critically needed job clubs across the state, which we call a Labor, Education, Action and Referral Network or LEARN. Labor liaisons from the United Way and representatives of Michigan State AFL-CIO Human Resources Development Inc. meet with unemployed workers, union and nonunion alike, every day somewhere in Michigan to offer support through a difficult transition.  The unemployed are finding information and referrals a necessary way of life. The job clubs provide directions and access to family counseling, credit advice and food banks. In meeting places across the state, including union halls, members are helping each other cope with the economic situation, making suggestions for job searches and sharing valuable information on good job prospects.  LEARN also connects workers, union and nonunion, with services provided by economic development and work force development partners. We link workers to high-quality training and give them the encouragement to start new careers through reschooling and other means.  According to the latest jobs report, the average weeks that individuals are unemployed rose to 29.1 weeks across America - the highest since the government started tracking. That means it takes almost seven months to find a job in America.  In Michigan it is worse. More than 800,000 workers are counted as jobless with over 100,000 unemployed for more than 105 weeks as of December. These 100,000 workers who have been unemployed for more than two years have run out of unemployment benefits.  As Michigan's hard-working people continue to lose their jobs, their benefits and sometimes use up their pensions, they are turning to unions for assistance. And we are not letting them down.

8. Pay down debt,"Guardian Money Pages 8. Pay down debt This, claims Jill Insley, is going to be the year when I practise what I invariably preach and actually do something about paying off all my unsecured debt.  I was good at keeping my bank account in the black until I had a baby - then it all went pear-shaped. Even before she was born, my daughter was good at getting me to spend money on her . . . and it's never really stopped.  Two years on, I became a single parent, and like many people who split up with their partners, I didn't cut back enough on our lifestyle-spending to fit my new budget. I gradually built up debt on a credit card, then on a second one, and my bank account has been constantly overdrawn.  Last year I paid off one credit card. But I have another to go, plus the overdraft. By the start of 2011 I want to have just one credit card that I can pay off in full every month (if I have used it), and no overdraft.  * Action plan  Switch cards to make sure you pay little or no interest on credit balances. According to the credit card tables on www.guardian.co.uk/money, the best balance transfer deal is now offered by Virgin: it charges 2.98% for transferring your balance, then 0% for 16 months. Just be aware that the card is run by MBNA and your application will be rejected if you already have a card with that company - as well as leaving a footprint on your credit record.  With interest rates so low on mortgage debt, now is a good time to use any surplus to pay down more costly unsecured debt. Overdrafts are obviously more expensive than 0% credit cards, so it makes more sense paying the minimum on the credit card until the overdraft has gone.  Close down any dormant savings accounts with odd bits of money in and pay the cash into the overdrawn current account.  Likewise, liquidate any non-performing investments. Better that they save you the interest you would otherwise be paying than sit in the hands of a hapless investment manager doing nothing.  Sell unwanted toys/books/bikes/coffee makers on eBay or at your local car boot sale.  Look for other savings by: switching broadband and landline suppliers (www.guardiandigitalcomparison.co.uk suggests a bundle provided by Orange for pounds 10 a month, with 20Mb broadband, unlimited download and free evening and weekend calls); switch gas and electricity deals (www.energyhelpline.com says Npower's Sign On-Line could take pounds 172 a year off my British Gas tariff, while Ovo New Energy, a newish utility provider, will only save pounds 144 but may be a better bet service-wise).  Leave the plastic perisher at home, ask for your credit limit to be reduced each time you pay back pounds 1,000 to eliminate the temptation of spending - and cut it up once it's paid off.",1
Don't be too late,"Don't be too late FINANCIAL security is the most common factor when it comes to deciding about when to retire, according to research released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for the current financial year.  ``But the problem is, without professional retirement planning advice, it's near impossible for most people to know if they're financially secure enough to provide for the retirement they  want,'' says John Newcomb, from RetireInvest Robina.  While their retirement lump sum is likely to be the biggest sum of money they've ever had, and may seem like a fortune, when the impact of tax and inflation is considered - and the fact the money might have to last for a retirement of up to 20 years plus - the amount might not end up stretching far at all.  ``It's important to think in advance about what sort of lifestyle you're expecting in retirement and consider the costs.''  While the government age pension may offer some support, and should be maximised through every reasonable way, it's not something to aspire to of itself.  In the quarter to September, 2007, the cost of living increased to $48,000 a year for retired couples with a lifestyle that included a broad range of leisure activities, private health insurance, a reasonable car, good clothes, and occasional international travel, according to Westpac/Association of Superannuation Funds research.  For those leading a more modest retirement lifestyle, better than the age pension but still fairly basic, the yearly cost was $26,300.  ``With life expectance increasing, it's even more important to ensure your retirement finances are well-planned so you don't outlive your money,'' says John.  When it comes to retiring, there are complex rules around tax, social security, investments and superannuation and  so many ways to structure finances.  ``If Australians only seek financial advice once in their life, planning for retirement is the time to do it and the earlier they seek advice, the more options they'll have,'' says John.  Professional financial advisers can help people identify what sort of retirement lifestyle they want and how to structure their resources to make the most of tax and social security rules and ensure they have a reliable income.  They can provide advice about how and where retirement savings should be put, how to get the most from superannuation and when to retire, as well as how to plan your estate so it's distributed to who you want in the most effective manner.  ``You only have one life so make the most of your retirement with help from a financial adviser,'' says John.  To find out more about how to retire successfully, or to attend one of this month's seminars, phone RetireInvest Robina on 5593 0000.  l John Newcomb is an authorised representative of RetireInvest Pty Limited (ABN 23 001 774 125), Australian Financial Services Licence 238429.

Consolidation loans - not the easy way out,"Consolidation loans - not the easy way out Debt consolidation can seem like an easy way out when the bills get too much. What could be simpler, after all, than rolling all those fiddly direct debits and standing orders into one handy payment each month, so you know exactly how much is going out and on what date?  Debt consolidation can help people to cope with their bills and even avoid going bankrupt. And if repayments on the loan are made promptly each month, a consolidation loan can be used to re-establish a good credit record.  However, debt consolidation loans can be a dangerous. Before you take out a consolidation loan you should understand the difference between secured and unsecured lending and the effect of compound interest  A secured loan, the type usually used for debt consolidation, is one that is linked to your house. The house is the security for the loan so, if you don't make all the repayments, the lender might be able to make you sell your home to pay them back.  This means that a secured loan is riskier for the borrower than an unsecured loan, which is not linked to anything. The worst penalty you face for defaulting on an unsecured loan is to be taken to court. But you should be aware that this might mean in the future you could have trouble getting such things as a credit card, a mortgage or other loan.  Compound interest is interest which is charged on interest that has already been added to a loan. If you do not make your monthly payments in full, you end up paying interest on interest.  How much you pay for a loan in total will be governed by the interest rate and the length of the loan. If you extend the length of your loan, even if the interest rate remains the same as on your previous loans, you will end up paying more back to your lender in the long run.  Debt consolidation loans usually work by bringing your monthly payments down to a level that you feel you can more comfortably afford. But they do this by extending the period of the loan, and making you pay more over the period.  Secured loans are usually offered on a variable rate basis so you could find your repayments soaring if interest rates rise.  So, before you take out a secured loan you should look at other options, including selling valuable items you no longer require, or moving your credit card and store card debt to a card with a lower interest rate.  If you have equity in your home, you could consider remortgaging to release capital as the interest rate on a mortgage tends to be lower than on secured loans.  Remortgaging your house in order to pay off debts does mean that you are securing those debts against your home and as such carries the same risk if you do not keep up the repayments as with a secured loan.",1
Women still lack financial self esteem,"BUSINESS Women still lack financial self esteem       A NEW report about what Australian women think about money shows a reluctance and low confidence to make investments.        The report, launched by the Financial Literacy Foundation, includes a comprehensive survey of how women describe their abilities, attitudes and behaviour on money issues, such as budgeting, saving, investing and protecting their money.        ``Women are more likely to have time outside the paid workforce and lower incomes, which in the end means less superannuation,'' foundation chairman Paul Clitheroe said.        ``Not only that, women's savings need to go further because they tend to live longer,'' Mr Clitheroe said.        Generally, many women already have good budgeting and saving habits. However, when it comes to investing, planning for the future and retirement -- all things that allow people to take long-term control of their money -- women say they're not confident.        Overall, the survey found:        * More than 70 per cent of women say they're confident with managing money, except for investing (63 per cent), understanding financial language (60 per cent) and ensuring enough money for retirement (60 per cent).        * Women and men have similar day-to-day money habits but women are more likely to regularly budget for day-to-day finances (women 53 per cent, men 44 per cent).        * Women are also more likely to invest in their own home (women 64 per cent, men 60 per cent) but less likely to have other investments.        * More men then women say they understand financial language (women 60 per cent, men 68 per cent) and more men say they can plan for their long-term future than women (women 77 per cent, men 84 per cent).        Importantly, the report found that women want to learn more about managing their money better.        ``I'm pleased to see that investing, planning for the future and retirement are all areas where women are interested in learning more,'' said Mr Clitheroe.        ``And it's not just important for women, I'd encourage everyone to take control of their long-term financial plans, as well as putting themselves in charge of their money day to day,'' he said.

BORROWERS TOLD TO ACT FAST OVER MORTGAGES,"City BORROWERS TOLD TO ACT FAST OVER MORTGAGES       Mortgage brokers were today urging homeowners to grab new loan deals now before they are scrapped.        As the flood of mortgages being pulled extended today to competitively priced products from a range of building societies, advisers said customers were having to move quickly before the most attractive deals disappear.        Brokers said they were encouraging customers to buy their products sometimes several months in advance.        Richard Morea of London & Country mortgages said: 'Until recently, the companies would tell us with plenty of notice if they were planning to withdraw a product so we could ring up the client and warn them. Now we don't even get told in advance. It's just gone.'        As many mortgages are guaranteed for up to six months, customers who think rates are going up can reserve a deal now even if their current mortgage deal does not expire until late summer.        Morea said: 'What we're saying is, if you like this offer, grab it now even if you don't need it for a few months.'        In the past two days, more than 570 mortgages have been withdrawn.        Last night saw Nottingham Building Society pull its buy-to-let two and three-year tracker, while the West Bromwich withdrew all its mainstream and buy-to-let mortgages, replacing them with more expensive options.        Darlington Building Society also withdrew its fixed products while Skipton announced plans for a Â£799 fee to its standard variable rate.        First Direct, the internet and telephone bank owned by    HSBC, this week closed its doors on new mortgages, while Nationwide has jacked up rates for many borrowers, particularly first-time buyers.        Rob Clifford, of broker Mortgage-force, cautioned: 'Can you rely upon a quote from a lender? The answer is no.        'Lenders are not obliged to honour quotes and could elect to reject all applications or offer less attractive deals.        'Consumers haven't got a cast-iron deal unless they have received a formal mortgage offer from the lender.'        The Bank of England yesterday warned that almost half of all lenders will ration mortgages over the next three months.        It recently conceded that two interest rate cuts since December, from 5.75% 5.25%, had done nothing to reduce mortgage costs as banks and building societies put up their own rates. The Bank is under growing pressure to cut rates to 5% next week.        The squeeze on credit by mortgage suppliers - and the prospect of job cuts in the City - is already hitting the housing market. The International Monetary Fund warned British house prices are overvalued by almost 30%.        Default rates on mortgages are expected to rise sharply this year.        Philip Shaw of Investec said: 'The situation has deteriorated further and that's consistent with the news over the past few days that mortgage lenders have been raising their rates and withdrawing products.        'Overall we feel there is a very strong case for rates coming down next week.'",1
Dividing the spoils,"BUSINESS Dividing the spoils       Q&A with accountant Phil Gostin        Q. How do you give your kids money without having to die first?        A. Assuming the parents have assets, and do not have any pension or concessions that could be affected in any way, it is as simple as realising the asset, paying the tax, (if applicable), and straight through to the keeper. But each situation is different.        Q. What are the consequences of giving your kids a deposit for their home or pay their kids school fees?        A. It depends. Firstly, do the parents have the ability to give? Will it impinge on their lifestyle? Will they cope in the event of failing health? The main consequences are effect on pension and tax. But if the parents have a super fund, no Centrelink issues, are retired and aged over 60 their ``drawings'' from funds are tax-free from July 1, 2007. However, if there is a Centrelink consequence, it needs to be looked at to ensure the best outcome.        Q. Is it better to withdraw lump sums from your super?        A. Because the goal posts have shifted, once you are retired and over 60 it's tax free -- whether it's taken as a lump or on the drip, is not the issue. The issue is to make it last, be able to give something to the kids if you can, or leave what remains to them.        Q. What about transferring assets into children's names?        A. The problem is the potential tax implications. Assuming assets were in the parents' name and post 1985, subject to capital gains tax, and if the parents still have significant income in their names, it might not be a good idea. But if the income is a pension from a super fund (self-managed or otherwise), then the tax may not be as significant.        Q. What are tax implications?        A. Tax is tax. Really the cashflow situation is the relevant one. For example, if we do this how much are we going to get? Again, it depends on what assessable income the parents are earning and from where -- ie. Centrelink.        Q. What are the limits or implications of gifting?        A. Gifting is only an issue if you have some aged pension benefit. You can only give $10,000 a year. It is important to note that you can give as much as you want but Centrelink will deem your asset base as dropping only by $10,000 a year. So you can give $100,000 but $90,000 is still included in the asset test when calculating the pension.        Q. Is it wiser to set up a family trust and make distributions that way?        A. The trust arrangement, first and foremost is about asset protection. It can be used for estate planning, but this ought to be done at set-up. What parents sometimes want to do is give the benefit of the investment without losing control of it.        DHS-20080331-1-030-597646",1
Money Management: Keeping it in the family.,"Money Management: Keeping it in the family.     It was uncertain how many providers would launch family pension products after Chancellor Gordon Brown's announcement in the Budget that these plans would still attract a tax charge when passing pension assets from generation to generation.      But Origen, the IFA business owned by Aegon, has clearly decided that the product still has its attractions with the launch of its first family self-invested personal pension.      The pension is established under a separate sub-trust within a SIPP and brings spouses, children, family members or friends into the SIPP prior to death as additional members.      Up to age 75, pension members use drawdown to provide an income; if they die during this time, a dependant's pension may be paid or money may be taken out of the pension to be paid to a beneficiary, less a 35% tax charge.      From age 75, an alternatively secured pension (ASP) is used to provide income; if a member dies during this time any dependant's pension would be paid with the balance of the fund going to the recipients' pension schemes, minus any IHT liabilities.      Charges vary by type of member: founder members and additional members who contribute more than AGBP3,600 pa pay an establishment fee of AGBP300, an annual fee of AGBP500 and AGBP150 pa for drawing an income.      Additional members who contribute AGBP3,600 pa or less pay a set-up charge of AGBP250 and AGBP200 pa. Non-contributing members pay a set-up fee of AGBP250 then AGBP100 pa. IFA commission is available, but must be paid out of the client's funds.      www.origenfs.co.uk   MM view - In abolishing the requirement that everyone must buy an annuity by age 75, the Chancellor opened up the possibility of passing on pension assets after death. Until he clarified their tax position in the Budget, it had been hoped that they could be passed to the next generation intact, with no IHT liability.      However, Brown stated in the Budget that assets held in an ASP would be considered part of a pensioner's estate and therefore could be subject to IHT before being passed to heirs' pension funds.      Many people prefer passing on 60% of leftover pension assets to their heirs rather than nothing. But news has emerged that a loophole in the Finance Act 2005 makes it possible for pension assets to be passed to other scheme members without paying any IHT through a small self-administered scheme (SSAS).      SSASs are no longer required to purchase a pension from an insurance company and can instead pay out directly from the scheme itself, reallocating money to other scheme members when one member dies.      This type of pension is not an option for all, but for those that can set up SSASs, (eg, small family businesses), this loophole makes it a more attractive alternative than the family SIPP proposition. Any IFAs also wishing to market this SIPP should contact Origen direct.      monica.woodley@ft.com      49045288",1
"Personal Business: OK, if I Just Pay the Card Minimum. . .Ouch","Personal Business: OK, if I Just Pay the Card Minimum. . .Ouch     You know that making only the minimum required payments on a credit card can be extremely costly over time. Several lawmakers want to make sure you see exactly how steep the tab can be -- by requiring personalized disclosures of the time and total interest payments it could take to retire your debt.      In the meantime, you can also find those scary numbers yourself, using online tools such as one at Bankrate.com.      Consider a consumer with a $7,000 balance on a card with a 12% interest rate. If the person paid the minimum due, typically 1% of the balance plus interest each month, it would take nearly 28 years -- yes, you read that correctly, 28 years -- to pay the balance down. The payment would start at $139.30 a month and get smaller as the balance fell. The total interest, $6,762.18, would nearly equal the original debt, according to Bankrate.com.      But if the consumer continued to pay a steady $139.30 every month, the debt would be paid off in less than six years and interest would amount to about $2,775, the online calculator shows. Pay $200 a month, and you'd be done in less than four years. At Bankrate.com, click on the ""Credit Cards"" tab and then, under ""Calculators,"" go to ""Paying the minimum.""      Five bills that would mandate customized disclosures are pending in Congress. Supporters hope to get some momentum from a recent study by the Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, on whether such disclosures might lead cardholders to make more-informed financial decisions. In a survey of cardholders, GAO found that people with credit-card debt wanted customized disclosures and found them very useful.      In the future, under the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, card issuers will be required to include on statements a general disclosure about the consequences of making only minimum payments, as well as a toll-free phone number for obtaining individualized information. The Federal Reserve is working on regulations to implement that law, which it expects to finish by the end of next year.      The GAO found that some lawmakers, consumer groups and educators believe that customized disclosures would be more noticeable and cause consumers to make larger payments or change how they use their cards. But card issuers told the GAO the proposed change wouldn't have much impact. They said the number of cardholders who routinely make only minimum payments is small, and that those who do pay the minimum probably can't afford to do otherwise.      The GAO study, released last month, was requested by Sens. Paul Sarbanes, (D., Md.) and Daniel K. Akaka, (D., Hawaii). Sen. Akaka introduced one of the credit-card disclosure bills and he ""hopes that the GAO report will boost support for his efforts in passing his legislation,"" says his press secretary.

Wealth: What you can learn from the big-money investors,"Wealth: What you can learn from the big-money investors     Big institutional investors are different from you and me. But that doesn't mean we can't learn from the way they handle money.      True, pension funds and other large players have more investment expertise and more access to investment talent. But here's a secret: In hiring independent investment firms to manage U.S.- and foreign-stock holdings, institutions stick to a methodical approach that anyone can follow.      How? When choosing a mutual fund or hiring any investment professional, pay attention to these criteria that institutions use in manager searches.      -- Process: Look for a Strategy      ""The first thing we look for is the business strategy: What is the firm as an organization trying to do?"" says Mary Cottrill, a senior portfolio manager for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, who oversees the pension fund's U.S. and international stock managers.      Every money manager Calpers hires must face a rigorous grilling, starting with a long questionnaire probing the firm's investment philosophy and how it aims to deliver solid long-term results. ""There's got to be some edge,"" Ms. Cottrill says. ""We always ask `What's the unique characteristic that your firm brings? What differentiates you from your competitors?'""      -- People: Incentives and Pay      A money manager's most valuable assets go home each night. So it's crucial that a firm has proper incentives to retain personnel, says Roger Fenningdorf, head of global manager research at Rocaton Investment Advisors LLC, a pension-plan consultant in Norwalk, Connecticut.      It's also important that the people overseeing the business be separate from those who oversee clients' money, and that succession plans exist so departures don't disrupt the investment process. ""We focus on firms that have a stable investment team and business team, and have a strong philosophy on [regulatory] compliance,"" Mr. Fenningdorf says.      -- Focus: Straight and Narrow      Discipline and consistency are among the qualities institutions value most. They are specific about dividing holdings across asset classes. Managers generally are hired for a certain expertise -- small stocks, foreign stocks, growth or value -- and are expected to stick to their knitting. ""We want to make sure they do what they say,"" Mr. Fenningdorf notes. Otherwise, there's a risk a slumping manager could switch to a hot sector, upsetting a carefully built portfolio. Discipline keeps managers on track until the tide turns in favor of their style.      -- Passion: What It Means      ""We're looking for talented, tenured, experienced teams that are passionate about investing,"" said Joe Brennan, head of portfolio review at Vanguard Group, the mutual-fund giant.      ""We see hundreds of potential managers a year,"" he says. Some managers gush about the number of new accounts or revenue their firms reeled in lately. Those aren't the priorities that Vanguard supports, Mr. Brennan says. ""Most great managers, you can't shut them up about stocks -- that's all they want to talk about,"" he says.",1
"Planner: Turn portfolio to more conservative path ; Without a secure job, it's important to tone down risk","MONEY Planner: Turn portfolio to more conservative path ; Without a secure job, it's important to tone down risk  Stacy Kopper has done two things very well, says Janet Briaud, a financial planner in Bryan, Texas.   ""She has developed a really nice portfolio for her age and kept her spending way down in this uncertain time,"" Briaud says.   The main thing Kopper needs to do, she says, is tone down the risk in her portfolio. ""If you don't have a secure job, then you want your portfolio to be more secure and safe.""   Given that Kopper plans to continue working into retirement age, as long as her investment assets grow a little bit, she doesn't need to take a lot of risk. Another reason to err on the side of caution is that stock valuations are high now.   ""It's just a time for Stacy especially to be pretty conservative,"" Briaud says.   To accomplish that, Briaud suggests that Kopper:   * Invest the IRA accounts in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS). ""They are very safe and secure investments that I think are underutilized,"" Briaud says. ""They are tax inefficient, so you want them in a retirement account.""   * Divide the roughly 30% of her assets now in the non-retirement portfolio among three mutual funds. Because the market is overvalued, Briaud recommends a mix of value-oriented funds and funds with a hedging strategy to help protect against volatility.   Specifically, she recommends a small-cap value fund, such as Oakmark Small Cap, and an international value fund, such as Tweedy Browne Global Value or Longleaf Partners International.   Briaud's third stock fund recommendation is Hussman Strategic Growth, which invests in U.S. stocks with the goal of preserving capital during unfavorable market conditions.   * Maintain her current cash position. ""She's got about 20% in cash, and I think that's appropriate,"" Briaud says.   * Put about 20% of her portfolio in a laddered portfolio of short- term Treasury bills or bank certificates of deposit with maturities ranging from one to three years. That money could later be used for a down payment on a home.   * Invest another 10% in an international bond fund, such as Pimco Global. ""I think eventually the dollar will come down, and another 10% in an international bond fund would help in that environment,"" she says.   Kopper should focus on getting the job she wants and making her portfolio more conservative. Once she's done those two things, she can begin to think about buying a home.   For the moment, she is lucky not to own a home, Briaud says. Home prices are high, and not owning a home gives her more flexibility in her job hunt.   The fact that Kopper's expenses are low and she has accumulated sizable savings gives her unusual freedom to make major changes. ""Her biggest asset is ability to earn,"" Briaud says.

Mail Money - MONEY BOX.,"Mail Money - MONEY BOX.     Lesley Collins, head of Independent Women Financial Advisers in Edinburgh and Glasgow, answers your queries      IAM in my early thirties and have never been good with money. My friends all have their own flats and seem to save each month. I don't have any real debt but seem to live from month to month. How can I get my finances in order?      MAKE an appointment with an IFA ask your friends to recommend someone or there are details on the internet of many in your area. Ask if they can help you complete a monthly income and expenditure plan and assess how you spend on basics each month and how much you can save, for short, medium and long term goals. MY husband and I are in the final stages of divorce. I have agreed to a lump sum of Â£40,000. As I have brought up our children, I've never paid into a pension. Is it too late to start? I don't actually need the money and I am aged 44.      IT depends on whether you are working and your income. If your total earnings are under Â£30,000, then you can pay Â£2808 net each year to your own stakeholder pension plan. As you get older, the amount you can pay may increase and you should ask your adviser to calculate the maximum each year. Until then, I would suggest you pay the Â£2808 now, also maximise your ISA allowance and with the remainder consider an investment that will allow you to withdraw Â£2808 each year to fund pension contributions. IAM due to get ill health retirement next month on a pension of Â£12,000 each year and lump sum of Â£35,000. I have an endowment mortgage of Â£12,000 with eight years to run. My policy appears to be on target to repay the loan but should I use my lump sum to pay off my mortgage? I could also overpay Â£150 to my mortgage each month. My husband earns a good salary but his pension will be lower when he retires in seven years.      I WOULD suggest you keep paying your mortgage and as your endowment is on target I see no reason to stop this now. If you can save Â£150 maybe an ISA would be better. This way, you will accrue a further lump sum which could be used once your husband stops work. You should also invest your lump sum wisely so you still have your capital to fall back on. IHAVE been with the same mortgage lender for almost 10 years. A lot of my friends seem to remortgage all the time. Can I do this without incurring a lot of extra cost? nIF you are not tied to your current lender you can remortgage without penalty. Shop around for the lender who offers the best rate and this will save you on monthly repayments. Some firms also offer to pay legal and valuation costs.",1
"Street Smart: Economy Watch -- Inflation Is Worse Than You Thought --- If the CPI does not reflect the true cost of living, your retirement...","Street Smart: Economy Watch -- Inflation Is Worse Than You Thought --- If the CPI does not reflect the true cost of living, your retirement plans could suffer     ECONOMISTS watch the consumer price index very carefully. And when it's released in the middle of each month, the response is nearly universal - they tell you it's wrong.      Foremost among the complaints: The CPI doesn't accurately measure how inflation hits the Average Joe. Many economists believe it sometimes lowballs inflation, which can reduce your comfort level in retirement.      In calculating CPI, the Bureau of Labor Statistics looks at changes in the price of consumer goods and services. The bureau tracks thousands of prices, from the cost of a doctor's visit to the price of houses and cars. But critics say the measure misses some quickly climbing costs, such as health care premiums and property taxes. That might explain why CPI was up 2.3 percent in 2003 but real life felt more expensive.      Where does the measure come off the tracks? First off, when figuring changes in housing costs, the bureau, oddly enough, doesn't use real estate prices. Instead, it calculates the value of a house based on what it would cost to rent. ""Housing has really mucked it up,"" says Dan Fuss, manager of the top-performing Loomis Sayles Bond fund. ""When you look at real estate ads, you see the housing prices going way up, but the rental costs are not. It's a distorted view.""      Another snag: The index is tweaked to account for product improvements, which offset rising prices. So while the cost of a car increases, the difference might be revised downward if the car now has airbags and a navigation system. But if you can't buy a car without airbags, it's still a rising cost. Plus, there are no revisions for deteriorating services. Have to wait hours in the doctor's office, despite rising health care costs? Too bad.      There are advantages to the government that result from keeping CPI low: Increases in Social Security benefits are linked to the index, so increases are lower (and pensioners are poorer). Additionally, it allows the Federal Reserve to keep rates low, making it easier for the government and consumers to manage debt. ""We wonder if things haven't gone overboard to keep the federal debt down and the deficit down and the cost of debt down,"" says Jim Floyd, a senior analyst with The Leuthold Group.      A lowball CPI is bad news if you own Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. TIPS have been popular in recent years as insurance against rising inflation because the yield is pegged to the CPI. But if the increases lag the real cost of living, retirees can't rely on the yield to pay for ever-more-costly staples. So what can you do about it? There's no easy answer. Save more, spend less, and when that CPI number is released, take it with a grain of salt.",1
The Life Mag - Money Matters - Dodging undue death duties.,"The Life Mag - Money Matters - Dodging undue death duties.   Q My husband died last year and I want to know if there are any ways to make sure that as much of my estate passes to my children as possible.    FD Four Oaks    A YOU are quite right to organise your affairs so that needless Inheritance Tax is not paid, and there are a variety of ways to do this. The first stage is to make sure your will is up to date, and that you have nominated who you want to benefit. At the moment, Inheritance Tax will be payable at 40 per cent on the value of your estate over #242,000. This can mean that many people who don't consider themselves at all wealthy, but have a large property, will be caught.    If you make outright gifts and survive for seven years then these will not count as part of the estate, and you can also use your annual gift allowances to give away up to #3,000pa tax free. The rules for this are quite straightforward and it is an area that many people never consider.    Assets such as cash, stocks and shares, unit trust etc, are often thought to be difficult to deal with because if you give lumps of cash to your children as 'lifetime' gifts, then you lose control of the capital, and many people don't have enough money to do this as they may require an income to live on.    There are however, methods where you can still get an income from these assets and ensure that any growth on the money will fall outside your estate. A plan that could be used might be a 'Gift and Loan' scheme which is set up under a special trust. This could be ideal in your situation. A factsheet on Inheritance Trusts can be obtained by ringing 0800 544644.    Q I am interested in putting some money into an ethical investment. Can you tell me if the charges are any different to normal funds and are they good value for money? GR Great Barr    A The charges will vary according to which company you choose and some are better than others. Having said this, as with any investments, the charging structure is only one part of the equation to be considered. The most important part is how well they are likely to perform with your money. All funds can fluctuate in their performance. However, it is not difficult to find an ethical fund with longer term performance better than the average of non-ethical funds in the same investment sector.    Certainly over the past few years we have seen a lot more investment companies launching these types of funds to meet increased demand. Many of these ethical funds are available as an Individual Savings Account (ISA), so you can benefit from tax efficient savings as well as the green issue.

Personal Finance - Drop in the ocean of with-profit policies.,"Personal Finance - Drop in the ocean of with-profit policies.   Wesleyan's actuary David Rutter has spoken out in defence of with-profit life policies after a report that the French owned colossus Axa had cut terminal bonuses on some of its policies by up to 70 per cent.    Like others, the Birmingham company, have had to cut the pay-outs on its maturing with-profit policies this year after the stock market fell by 11 per cent during 2000.    But the #9,568 paid on a ten-year Wesleyan policy costing a 29-year-old at the outset #50 a month, still represents a return of 9 per cent a year tax-free, in a decade when inflation averaged 2.5 per cent a year.    The #107,772 paid out on a similar 25-year policy represented a sharper drop - 5.4 per cent - because 1975 was one of the best years in the history of the stock exchange and it dropped out of the 25-year reckoning.    But the return of 13.5 per cent a year still handsomely outstripped inflation, averaging 4.4 per cent a year.    Mr Rutter explained that this 5.4 per cent cut in the pay-out was achieved by lowering the terminal bonus by 8 per cent.    The original sum assured under the policy and subsequent bonuses added to it each year cannot be taken away from the value. So, when a life company wishes to alter the pay-out in either direction, it can do so only by changing the terminal bonus.    'It depends how active a policy offices have got,' Mr Rutter said. 'We try to smooth it from year to year.    'Our funds had an excellent return in 2000 compared to markets as a whole because we were significantly under-weight in technology and telecoms stocks.    'In 1999, we were left out of the boom, but we were left out of the bust last year. We are buying into some selected technology companies now that we feel market values are more reasonable.'    A spokesman for Axa, which owns both Sun Alliance and Equity & Law, said the 70 per cent cut reported last week-end was an exceptional case.    It arose because a customer wanted to transfer a ten-year-old pension policy to another company when it still had more than five years to run.    At this stage, the terminal bonus accounts for only a small part of the total value of #130,000. The value of the policy had been cut by 6.5 per cent year-on-year, but this all had to come out of the terminal bonus, which was indeed reduced by 70 per cent.    'If he had kept it the proportion of the terminal bonus would have gone up,' the spokesman said.    'Terminal bonuses are calculated case by case. The issue will be how long a policy has been in force and whether it is being cashed in or transferred early.'.",1
Rate cut may remind some homeowners to refinance.,"Rate cut may remind some homeowners to refinance.   NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters) - Wednesday's surprise rate cut by the U.S. central bank likely will not bring about a spike in home loan refinancings to kick up prepayments within mortgage securities, market participants said.    In fact, the cut in borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.50 percent may only serve as a reminder for home owners to save on borrowing costs by refinancing their loans.    While the surprise cut lowered short-term U.S. Treasury rates and mortgage bond spreads narrowed in the wake of the announcement, market watchers said a one day rally in U.S. government bonds probably won't fire up a protracted wave of prepayments.    Prepayments, ""depend on the extent of the rally,"" said Art Frank, head of mortgage research at Nomura Securities International Inc.    Most observers said it was too soon to say what prepayments will do, but all agreed that they are watching the slope of the U.S. yield curve and dollar prices of mortgage debt.    Investors are watching dollar prices of mortgage securities, particularly current coupon mortgage bonds, to see if dollar prices jump above par, or $100.    When the current coupon mortgage bonds hit par, then consumers have a greater incentive to refinance their loans, resulting in a prepayment. The prepayment of a mortgage security forces bond holders to reinvest their cash in a less advantageous, lower yield environment.    At midday, current coupon Fannie Mae mortgage securities were up 15/32 at 99 16/32.    ""6-1/2s are close to being par. If they remain near par, we'll continue to be in a refinance environment,"" said David Montano, director of mortgage strategy at Credit Suisse First Boston. With 6-1/2s close to being par, ""we are back to a very negatively convex mortgage market.""    ""If they go back to the vicinity of par, then you get a pickup in refinancings,"" said Frank. ""If we get to around par, we get a fresh group of people refinancing.""    Also, the steepening in the Treasury curve this morning promises to kick up demand for mortgage bonds because a steeper curve implies there may be a pickup in demand for pass-throughs used in the creation of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs).    Meanwhile, the possibility of a prolonged period of refinancings has prompted calls for caution by at least one market player.    ""We are clearly still in a refinance environment. Mortgage performance has been overly exuberant. They (mortgage securities) are too rich given prepayment risk and you're not getting compensated for this,"" said Montano.    Wednesday's surprise move by the Fed is sure to jolt some consumers into action, said market participants.    ""Maybe a part of the Fed easing wakes people up to fact that rates are low,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Fannie Mae.    ""The rates may not go down, but this news might spur people"" to refinance, said Dr. Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo.",1
Jobs & Money - Women stand to get a better deal.,"Jobs & Money - Women stand to get a better deal.   Stakeholder pensions are good news for female workers, many of whom have been unable to join company pension schemes, says the TUC.    It has just published a free leaflet explaining why stakeholders will be ideal for millions of women.    ""For too long, women have missed out on decent pension rights in the past. And with so many in part-time work and taking career breaks, they are still losing out,"" says TUC general secretary John Monks. ""The flexibility of the new stakeholder pension scheme, due to go online next month, will be invaluable to these women. That's why we're making every effort to ensure they know all they need to about how the schemes will work.""    For several reasons, women retire with pensions worth, on average, 85% of men's, says the TUC.    To start with, women generally earn less than men, so have less cash to put aside into a pension. Women also tend to take more time out of the labour market than men, perhaps to care for children or elderly relatives, and so have less time to build up a good pension.    Only 39% of women, compared with 52% of men, belong to company pension schemes and women are more likely to work for employers that do not offer a company scheme. Many women work part-time and in the past many pension schemes refused entry to part time or temporary workers. Also, until recently, women lost out on pensions if they divorced.    The flexibility of stakeholder plans means that many women will find them a useful way of saving for a pension for the first time:    You can stop and start contributions to a stakeholder as you wish, without incurring any financial penalty, making them ideal for women who work only during school term time, for example.    You don't have to be working to contribute to a stakeholder pension. People who are not working can pay up to #3,600 a year tax free into a plan, or get someone else to pay into a scheme on their behalf - ideal for women taking a career break to bring up a family.    Starting contributions to stakeholder pensions are low - payments can be made from as little as #20 a month, putting them more within the reach of many women on low incomes.    Stakeholder pensions offer an easy way for newly divorced women to start a pension. Under new legislation, women can take a share from their ex-husband's pension to kickstart their own.    Stakeholders can be used to top up an occupational pension scheme to make up for missing years when no contributions were made.

Million-dollar Partners,"Money Million-dollar Partners ""You do need the support of a spouse that is like-minded,"" confides Leonard Barnes, the author of Property Power, who made his first million in eight years. ""Two minds are better than one. Not only do you need the judgment of two individuals, but the back-up of research.""  Mr Barnes set out to make a million dollars in 12 years by investing in property, mainly in Brisbane and Sydney. He achieved his target four years earlier than scheduled. So what's his secret?  A supportive partner comes top of his list. He also did a lot of research into property and its cycles, a medium he feels comfortable with.  ""It wasn't really that hard. You need to work, study books, scan the newspapers - if it's something you enjoy, it's not a burden.  ""You need to be a calculated risk taker - do your research and be confident it will pay off.""  Mr Barnes favors the old-fashioned value of frugality. ""I still drive a  10-year-old car worth about $10,000,"" he says. He loves his old Ford Capri convertible and thinks it is just as much fun, but a lot cheaper, than a new Saab convertible.  ""There are two sorts of affluence: income affluence and asset affluence. The income affluent burn their money on holidays, restaurants, cars etc. They're really consumers - they don't accumulate assets.""  Mr Barnes admits one of the downsides of making money through property was moving house so regularly. ""My daughter had, at the age of seven, lived in six different houses. It was tough on her.""  And now that he's a millionaire, what next? ""A million bucks is not enough to stop at,"" Mr Barnes says. ""I'd like to put another million together.""  ""At my age, I'm too young to retire,"" says the 45-year-old entrepreneur, who still holds down a part-time day job. He plans to devote more time to writing. In the current cycle, Mr Barnes believes there is nothing further to be gained from property and he has diversified into shares and bought part of a hotel.  He also admits to loosening the purse strings a little now. He, his wife and daughter took a trip around the world last year and had a stint on board the QE II. ""We are starting to reward ourselves . . . but you can spend it pretty quickly.""  He has always had a fondness for sailboats. He owns a boat that costs less than the average family car but is big enough to spend weekends on. It was during his honeymoon on the boat that he and his wife made a pact to make their fortune. They were inspired by the wealthy people they met on the high seas.  Mr Barnes says his philosophy is to achieve and have fun but not to do it at premium prices. How long will it take to make that next million?",1

At 60, she is looking at the end of a 35-year career, feeling worn out physically and burned out mentally. After years of shift work and increasing work loads brought on by cuts in provincial health budgets she feels dragged down by the work in her clinic and by incessant home visits Her patients are palliative in the process of dying people with post operative infections and others with diabetic wounds She says it is profoundly draining Her home in a mature neighbourhood with cottonwoods and hazelnut trees is a refuge but only for a few hours at a time At the end of her working day she takes care of her year old mother who lives nearby in a nursing home She is understandably exhausted I enjoy the job in that I can help people but the toll of sicker patients and the amount of paperwork has got to me she says I am thinking I could retire at and still work part time Julia explains The trouble is that there is no guarantee that I may get enough work My problem is that I didn t contribute as much to my pension plan as I now wish I had Yet she is not quite ready to quit Her problem is that her means for retirement which are her financial assets a little over plus a work pension of a month at age which reduces to at CPP and OAS will only provide about to a month before tax whether she ends full time work at which she would like or which she would accept if necessary Family Finance asked Derek Moran head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with Julia She seems solid and sensible and just needs help with compiling her figures and a boost to her confidence he explains It is true that her work pension is less than it might have been had she maxed out her contributions but we can work with that problem Building retirement income With planning Julia can retire at age She should top up her RRSPs She has of space She can take the money from her cash balance of She would get a refund of approximately or which she can add to her TFSA over two subsequent years pushing its present balance to Her RRSP would rise to Mr Moran estimates In retirement Julia can have the full Canada Pension Plan benefit of CPP will be her largest fully indexed pension She could take it at age with a reduction but that would mean giving up a lot of her CPP indexation To match the age CPP at age she could withdraw a year from her RRSP She will be able to draw Old Age Security benefits at age at the full present rate of a year The plan is simple She would add a month as she does now to her RRSP to age then take a year from her RRSP from to The balance left would be She will have preserved her CPP in full and get full indexation and spread the income from her RRSP so that she is not hit with high taxes when under RRIF rules she has to take about at rising to in her s Her monthly income from age to would therefore be from her work pension from the five year bridge to nothing from CPP or OAS and from her RRSP for total income of a month before tax At a average tax rate she would have a month to spend which would exceed her present monthly allocations net of RRSP TFSA and cash savings Monthly income from age forward would be from her work pension CPP benefits from Old Age Security and nothing from investments which could grow at after inflation plus a return from her financial assets Her total income would be a month enough to support present net spending Julia s RRSP funds will have been boosted by a tax refund to but reduced by five years of contributions and eroded by payouts to That sum plus the enhanced balance of her TFSA and cash would leave her total financial assets at These funds invested to return a year after inflation would generate income of a year or a month That would make her total income a month The process of delaying CPP benefits will have both allowed retirement at and created a rising income in retirement Budget

"Younger workers without own property will have to save much more to enjoy a basic income
The average person will have to save Ã‚Â£260,000 over their lifetime to enjoy a basic income in retirement, climbing to Ã‚Â£445,000 if they are unable to get on the property ladder, according to a report by a former government pensions minister.","Younger workers without own property will have to save much more to enjoy a basic income
The average person will have to save Ã‚Â£260,000 over their lifetime to enjoy a basic income in retirement, climbing to Ã‚Â£445,000 if they are unable to get on the property ladder, according to a report by a former government pensions minister. In a gloomy assessment of the outlook for today s millennial generation Steve Webb said most savers in the government s auto enrolment scheme were likely to accumulate only half the target amounts The report Will we ever summit the pensions mountain from the pensions investment company Royal London where Webb is director of policy assumes that the average person will need to generate an income of just over a year to top up their state pension at But to achieve that income with some protection from inflation the person will have to save Worryingly younger workers who fail to buy their own home and face a lifetime of renting will have to save far more Royal London said it expected that around one in three retirees would eventually be renting and would typically need to find a year to pay private landlords This additional costs means they will have to accumulate to fund their retirement We can no longer assume that we will be mortgage free homeowners in retirement For those unable to get on the property ladder during their working life a large private rental bill needs to be factored in to retirement planning said Webb Data on amounts saved in pension plans is incomplete with many people having different pots of money while working for different employers over their career but Webb said the average sum saved into pension pots was around to Except for a dwindling number of people enjoying final salary pensions the large majority of private sector workers now have to rely on whatever amounts are saved into their company scheme Historically low interest rates also mean the income from savings is at rock bottom lows The pension mountain has grown by about in real terms since said Webb This is partly because we are living longer and partly because interest rates are much lower so a given pension pot generates a smaller income In a pension pot of about would have delivered a private pension of a year through retirement but the target has jumped to today T Z T Z https media guim co uk bb abe f ac c dba b a jpgHistorically low interest rates mean that the income from savings is at rock bottom lows",1
"Are Wisconsin's public employees overpaid?
The question is fundamental to judging the cost effectiveness of government and the necessity of the polarizing Act 10, in which Gov. Scott Walker instituted dramatic benefit cuts for unionized public workers to help balance the budget.","Are Wisconsin's public employees overpaid?
The question is fundamental to judging the cost effectiveness of government and the necessity of the polarizing Act 10, in which Gov. Scott Walker instituted dramatic benefit cuts for unionized public workers to help balance the budget. But scholars disagree substantially on how Wisconsin s public and private workers compare in terms of wages Two recent studies show salaries and benefits for public workers are about percent more than comparable private workers but another study asserts public workers make percent less The key divide is over how to calculate retirement benefits Public employers also have a more compressed pay scale said Charlie Carlson a Middleton labor expert who has done public private compensation comparisons for municipalities across the state He told Gannett Wisconsin Media that local governments typically pay less than private employers to top managers roughly the same to mid level skilled workers and more to those in lower skilled positions But local market factors mean the comparison may vary widely among municipalities And statewide comparisons can t be done on a position by position basis since public sector jobs such as police and firefighters don t have private sector equivalents The solution for academic researchers is a human capital approach in which workers are compared on factors that affect compensation rather than on the specific occupation Some studies include dozens of variables the primary ones being education experience the skill required by a given job and the number of hours worked This doesn t yield results for specific entities that is addressed in a flurry of local studies commissioned after Act But it can show on a statewide basis how public and private workers compare in terms of pay and benefits depending on whom you believe Studies vary on compensation comparison Three recent studies examining pay and benefits use different methods and come to disparate conclusions Andrew Biggs of the American Enterprise Institute and Jason Richwine of the Heritage Foundation wrote in a May study for the conservative American Enterprise Institute that state of Wisconsin employees are paid percent more than their private sector counterparts State workers total compensation was about percent higher before Act they said The study showed salaries are roughly equivalent between the public and private sectors but benefits are a different story Even after Act state workers pensions are nearly five times as valuable as those in the private sector and health benefits are about twice as generous A November study from the MacIver Institute a conservative Madison based think tank said Wisconsin s public sector employees received pay and benefits percent above the private sector The study co authored by William Even an economics professor at Miami University in Ohio covers both state and local government employees but does not account for Act changes since it uses data from The two studies contrast sharply with a February study that Jeffrey Keefe conducted for the liberal Economic Policy Institute in Washington D C Keefe said Wisconsin s state and local public employees received pay and benefits totaling percent less than their private sector counterparts even before Act reduced the value of public benefits The MacIver Institute study differed from the others in not taking into account the size of the employer Larger companies generally pay higher wages and benefits and government entities are relatively large so the studies by Keefe and Biggs compared salaries only to private firms of employees or more Pensions key to study differences The main difference among the three studies arises from disagreement over the value of public pensions Olivia Mitchell executive director of the Pension Research Council at The Wharton School in Pennsylvania said the rate of interest used in the calculations is crucial since the pension plan s cost to taxpayers rises by nearly percent with every percent reduction in the assumed interest rate Most government agencies assume an percent rate of return in determining how much to pay into the pension fund annually to yield the promised payouts at retirement Keefe s study calculated pension value simply on the amount paid in by the employers He said the methodology used in the other two studies is extremely conservative and assumes virtually no return on the pension fund Biggs and Richwine used a rate of return of approximately percent in their calculations which Biggs said is an accurate estimate for a no risk investment and is on par with a government bond rate Public pension amounts are backed by the government and carry no risk to employees unlike a typical private sector retirement plan that has no guaranteed value at retirement Even who did the MacIver Institute study also used a return rate of about percent He said if he assumed an percent rate as Keefe did his study would have shown a percent premium for public workers in Wisconsin instead of percent No one who has a k plan would be correct in assuming they re going to earn percent on their money for the rest of their life Even said You re making a promise that is backed by the faith of the state government so the thinking is you should assume an interest rate that the state should borrow at We assumed a percent rate and if anything I think in today s world that s probably a little

If so, are there any limitations as to the amount and what are the benefits?","Q MY wife is about to turn 65 and at this stage intends to continue working 26 hours a week. Her employer, of course, makes contributions to her super fund and at the same time she makes a co-contribution, which is deducted from her pay packet fortnightly.
Can she continue to make this co-contribution after she turns 65 and continues working, and also can she make lump sum contributions from our joint savings after this date? If so, are there any limitations as to the amount and what are the benefits? A WE need to clarify some terminology regarding the super Your wife is making an undeducted contribution to super which then attracts a co contribution from the Commonwealth Government Your wife can continue to receive the Government co contribution while she is or younger She can also make lump sum contributions if she wishes Another strategy to consider is salary sacrifice If her income is more than a year then see if her employer will allow her to salary sacrifice her pre tax income to super This will then limit her overall tax to per cent rather than per cent which applies to income above Q MY husband is and earning a year I am and no longer working We own our home and have in a secured investment with the bank My husband s super is currently worth invested in a balanced fund His employer contributes with a salary sacrifice contribution of a month My super is worth Will my husband be able to retire at age or will he need to work until he is and eligible for an age pension A YOU haven t mentioned how much income you need to live on so it is difficult to give you an estimation Your total investment assets are including your super even though you cannot access it until If these investments earn per cent you could drawdown a year without touching the capital You would then both need to access Centrelink benefits probably Newstart Allowance which would provide you with income of nearly a year If your total income is a year it is not a lot less than you are receiving now after tax However you have two potential problems First if the investments don t earn per cent and second if you need to buy major items such as a motor vehicle If you do decide to work for the next three or so years it will be very important for you to accumulate more money to allow for a buffer over and above what you currently have Q I AM and currently rent a property with my fiancee We also have saved in the bank but no other investments We want to buy our own home but also want to buy an investment property Should I use it all as a deposit on our own home or split it as separate deposits on each home A I WOULD encourage you to use most of it on a deposit on the home you intend to live in The less debt you have on your home the better because the interest is not tax deductible You can use the equity in your home to borrow for the investment property which is tax deductible Direct any spare savings to reducing your home loan debt as quickly as possible Or you could buy your home and the rental property at a later stage The property market has flattened off at present so buying now may see little capital gain over the next few years Q I AM and have in super and am no longer working My husband is with an annual salary of and super of about He intends to retire at age We owe about on our mortgage paying a month Would it be more tax effective to withdraw my super at and pay off our mortgage and then have my husband increase his super contribution through salary sacrifice A YOUR strategy is very sound particularly now with the introduction of super splitting rules For you to have a month to pay off the mortgage a year your husband needs to earn about before tax If he salary sacrifices this to superannuation will end up in the fund after contributions tax of per cent He will then be able to split this and have it transferred to your name The you have withdrawn will be replaced in two years which is a much better result than gradually paying off the mortgage A variation could be to reduce mortgage payments to a month so that the loan is repaid in years retirement The balance of available money could then be salary sacrificed This would allow you to keep your superannuation in place while still accumulating a considerable amount of extra superannuation Again the super splitting should be considered to try to end up with equal amounts at retirement Glenn Todman is a director and authorised representative of Goldsborough Financial Services Ltd Australian Financial Services Licence No His professional advice should be considered as an opinion and readers should strongly consider engaging their own personal financial advisers Questions and answers may have been edited for length Question I AM years old and have been offered redundancy by my employer after eight years service so the amount is not that great My wife doesn t work and we have two children at school I am not overly confident of finding other work quickly however if I stay I will be asked to do more and harder tasks Then later I may be forced to leave with possibly less or no benefits I am faced with a lose lose situation and don t know what to do What would your advice be Answer I WOULD find it difficult to imagine that no benefits would be available later however if the company closes down it could take a long time to receive them Ansett is a similar situation that comes to mind There are some suggestions I could make initially First visit Centrelink to ascertain what benefits you would be entitled to Newstart Allowance and Family Allowance You haven t said whether you have a mortgage however these benefits will help you financially while looking for work Second seek the services of a career consultant to identify your transferable skills and help you seek other work They can also prepare a resume for you Consulting a financial planner will assist you with the financial aspects should you decide to leave Doing these things will guide you in your decision as to leaving or staying If you leave I suggest you retain access to

LOUIS Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ Three administrators of the Firemen's Retirement System of St. Louis have together received more than $40,000 in holiday bonus pay over the past four years, even as city workers have largely gone without a raise.

Every year during the first week in December, the three fire pension employees collected checks ranging from $2,400 to more than $6,000 Ã¢â‚¬â€ paid via the city's payroll system as overtime. This year Susan Degunia an administrative assistant who makes nearly a year charged the system for hours of overtime in the two week pay period or extra Marilyn Williams an administrative secretary who is paid a year and is the wife of system board member Bruce Williams filed for hours of overtime or And Vicky Grass the system s a year executive director signed for hours of her own overtime costing the system Over the past four years Grass has been paid more than in extra December cash Grass said the payments have never been for overtime They re actually vacation buyback authorized by pension board policy she said She just records the pay as overtime because it s easier she said We are not trying to hide anything in no way shape or form Grass said City officials however were outraged when city Director of Personnel Richard Frank discovered the payments this week Frank initially thought salaried employees were getting paid overtime something not allowed in city departments I ve never seen anything like it Frank told the Post Dispatch I just don t know what to say It s like a bonus I felt like I had an obligation ethically to share this with the administration I was just appalled Bonuses Frank said are often illegal in the state of Missouri for public sector employees But it turns out that the fire pension s vacation policies allow such buyback payments The policy which was approved in gives each employee six weeks of paid leave each year according to system records Employees can carry over up to six weeks each year giving them at max weeks of vacation they can use in one year under the policy And in December of each year the system will buy up to two weeks of each employee s vacation back from them without any stipulations In addition a policy gives each employee a bonus on Dec The overtime checks Grass said were simply two weeks of vacation buyback per employee plus She couldn t immediately explain any discrepancy between that calculation and the actual payments which were often a little lower and sometimes much higher and bristled at criticism I have no clear idea where this is coming from because we ve been doing it for so long Grass said We all consider ourselves to be the most fortunate people in the world By Wednesday the city s budget director had inquired about the charges the city counselor s office had been asked to investigate and Mayor Francis Slay s chief of staff Jeff Rainford declared that the payments were made at the expense of other city employees They decided to give themselves a Christmas bonus Rainford said That s galling While the pension system is partially funded by city firefighters they pay percent of their salary each year into the fund any marked dip in the fund balance is by law replenished by the city That means in slender years tax dollars have to make up for increases in pension administration This year the city paid more than million to the fund City employees Rainford noted this year got their first raise percent in several years The fire pension system s three full time employees administer a fund of more than million It is a creation of state law governed by a board of eight local appointees most of whom are current or former firefighters Board chairman Len Wiesehan could not be reached for comment Thursday The pension system has been under extra scrutiny for more than a year following a Post Dispatch investigation revealing widespread misuse of fire disability retirements and dozens of additional benefits rubber stamped over the years by city officials Early this year Slay introduced a plan to close the current system and open a new one with markedly less expensive payouts He sought to cut many of the add on perks and curb a disability pension so rich his staff felt that it encouraged firefighters to go out injured Moreover under the new system the board would be governed by city law not state law as it is now and its employees would be part of the city s civil service system which is governed by a lengthy and strict set of rules Vacation buybacks would only be allowed under civil service guidelines if the worker was urgently needed yet had to either use his vacation or lose it Frank said Frank himself would have to sign off on it He said the Fire Department asked for buybacks every year but he hadn t authorized such a move in five years Now however it is unclear whether Grass and her staff will end up in the civil service system After Slay s plan passed through the Board of Aldermen the pension board sued the city over the issue",1

Women Empowering Women - what could be bad about a scheme like that?

according to both the department of trade and industry's debt task
force, many more women are in the red. The trend won't show up in the
national bankruptcy statistics for another year or so. But there is
another barometer: the popularity of a financial scheme called Women
Empowering Women (WEW).
 A system which purports to help women help each other it is in fact a traditional pyramid selling scam and one which many women are getting into debt to join Despite months of negative publicity since the scheme collapsed on the Isle of Wight earlier this year thousands are still paying to put their their names on a heart chart as the pyramids are known There are schemes all over Britain with an estimated women involved The set up is informal there is no central organisation You go to a party have a glass of wine and a handful of crisps hand over the money and leave with your heart Once eight investors have entered below you on the pyramid chart you collect Some women claim to have collected within days The scheme runs on word of mouth most women join through a friend colleague or relative To keep it going they just recruit more friends Financially it works but only at first But sooner rather than later the scheme runs short of recruits On the Isle of Wight with a population of only the scheme faltered within months leaving an estimated of investors with nothing and no chance of compensation Even in the US with its vast population where schemes ran under names like The Ya Ya Sisterhood after Rebecca Wells s girl bonding novel WEW collapsed within a year By the end of last year as the craze reached a peak more than a dozen women were arrested for running gifting clubs and hundreds more face law suits The practice is now illegal in nine states Tracey McHale is a typical Isle of Wight victim A beautician and single mother from Shanklin she lost in May when she invested in a scheme she had heard about on the local radio station The day I went to give in my money there were five other women queueing with cash I just got given a blank piece of paper which was supposed to be my heart From day one I thought it was a fraud but all I heard was good news about it that people had bought new kitchens and had all this money She has joined another scheme the Isle of Wight s Community Investment Club with other losers and from an initial stake has had back so far I joined this one because I had no choice I had lost every penny I had she says To survive and find new recruits the scheme sugar coats a direct appeal to greed by telling women they will be helping other women and getting their own back on the male dominated capitalist system Although WEW has apparently no central structure there is literature usually badly photocopied and barely legible or downloaded from the internet It uses woolly touchy feely caring sharing phrases such as supporting other women and says WEW aims to facilitate a safe place to help eradicate the poverty and isolation that many women suffer This is the sort of language that first attracted Sharon A housewife and mother of two from Sutton Coldfield her husband is managing director of a company and they have a second home in Spain She is going through the heart chart for the second time It s about supporting each other I joined with my friend we went halves and each paid Within five weeks we collected between us I haven t seen any harm come out of it I ve seen women collect She is annoyed that the bad publicity is stopping more women from benefiting It was on GMTV and since then it s more difficult to get people to join she says Bridget from North London says she was also impressed by the so called gifting aspect of the scheme Women who have already had a pay out or can afford to be generous anyway are encouraged to help out less fortunate women by paying some or all of their share I joined this scheme to help other women make money and I can see that it works I have seen a lot of women make thousands already and give other women the chance to join But it s the caring and sharing approach that makes WEW dangerous says Robert Fitzpatrick president of Pyramid Scheme Alert a leading US authority on financial scams It purports to be a new value system support not competition giving not taking networking These are portrayed as values that women are particularly tuned into And they are values scorned in the normal business world That resonates very strongly with a lot of women WEW has nothing to do with women per se All the rhetoric used in WEW can be said of all the other pyramid schemes They always spread by personal contact you need a camouflage a story geared towards a specific group If the group is New Agey the story will be about vaguely philosophical concepts like attracting abundance into your life Similarly there are schemes in the US for African Americans which promote exactly the same ideals as Women Empowering Women about overcoming past grievances making up for previous losses getting even after discrimination Donna Bradshaw is a director at the London based financial advisers Fiona Price Partners which specialises in giving advice to women She has been approached by several professional women asking whether they should invest in WEW Women are portrayed as less financially astute and this scheme is taking advantage of that Basically it panders to people s greed although they wrap it up very nicely Some of the women seem to get so confused by the logistics of it all that it is legal to use their annual gift exemption of for example that they don t look at the mechanics Which is that sooner or later it will dry up I would really like to see it made illegal The title makes me sick You re not empowering anyone you re just weakening your financial position The women who remain in WEW however are convinced that they are right no matter what anyone says Sharon even plans to re invest to stop the cycle from ending But as Fitzpatrick points out Re investing will delay the in evitable but it can t change the maths God forbid that someone asks the horrible question Where does it all end Because that is the whole point of course it will end And more than of people who have invested money will lose it",1

--Will hurt those on fixed incomes; adjustable-rate mortgage holders will benefit Impact of credit card interest rate charges is heightened By Jennifer Waters A DOW JONES COLUMN Borrowers breathed a collective sigh of relief when the Federal Reserve said earlier this month that it would hold interest rates at rock bottom for the next two years But savers were far from happy The news was a little depressing for savers said Jim Chessen chief economist at the American Bankers Association It means low savings rates will be par for the course for the next couple of years A divided Federal Reserve conceded Aug that the economy was weak with downside risks on the rise and announced surprisingly that it would extend near zero short term interest rates another two years That s considered a target rate that banks follow closely when setting the federal funds rate the amount they charge each other for overnight loans as well as the competitive interest rates they charge consumers and businesses A Sting For Savers The Fed s move was aimed at goading consumers and businesses to look again at leverage as a means of investing in the economy either through big ticket purchases like houses cars and large appliances or for businesses in equipment new systems and even workers The Fed thinking is that if interest rates stay low enough people and businesses won t be afraid to borrow which could shake this stagnant economy back into growth mode But it stings if you re on a fixed income facing rising costs for energy and food or if you re so wary of your money disappearing in the stock market that you re sitting on a bank savings account full of cash Most bank savings rates are below Low interest rates hurt too if your retirement is dependent on interest income from certificates of deposit Interest rates on a one year CD have plunged to from just three years ago according to Bankrate com Most money market mutual fund yields are at And at those rates there s no wiggle room for inflation which rose in the last year It doesn t matter if your money is liquid or tied up in a CD the yields right now do not compensate you for inflation said Greg McBride senior financial analyst at Bankrate com But A Win For Homeowners But if you re a homeowner with say a adjustable rate mortgage that s already past the first five years of the fixed rate portion you re in pretty good shape for the next couple of years A ARM has an initial interest rate for five years and thereafter has an adjustment interval of one year Ditto on those home equity lines of credit which carry variable interest rates mostly based on the prime rate which also trends with the federal funds rate Low interest rates also have contributed to year troughs in mortgage rates which are determined by a variety of interest rate benchmarks Freddie Mac FMCC reported average fixed mortgage rates rose modestly last week to after seven straight weeks of declines A year ago the year fixed rate mortgage stood at The ARM slipped to setting a record low Low interest rates could be mixed blessings for credit card holders unless of course you don t pay your bills on time and get slapped with high penalty rates Thanks to the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act most banks reset their average percentage rates to variable terms plus margins meaning they could rise and fall along with the prime rate It doesn t look like there s going to be any cost of funds pressure on credit card issuers to increase annual percentage rates said Ben Woolsey director of consumer research at CreditCard com The cost of funds refers to the rates banks charge each other on overnight loans It appears that banks are opening up more credit to people with excellent credit A low interest environment makes it even more important that you pay off your credit card balances however Because you re earning very little return on savings accounts and CDs the amount you pay in interest rate charges has a bigger impact on your total budget and cash flow Generally interest earned on savings accounts can help offset the interest paid on credit cards Though the interest is adding only dimes and nickels to many savings accounts now and for the next two years a federally insured bank is still a good place to stash your cash Jennifer Waters is a writer for MarketWatch She can be reached at or via email at AskNewswires dowjones com END Dow Jones Newswires August ET GMT",1

Such advice is sound, and though retirement is a long way off from the start of one's career, those professionals who heed these words of wisdom and start saving early are bound to benefit down the road. But even the best advice can fall on deaf ears from time to time and many people simply don t save enough for retirement A survey from Fidelity Investments revealed just how much financial trouble the average American is likely to be in upon retirement The survey asked more than participants a range of questions on topics including their health retirement and saving habits and found that the average baby boomer which includes those born between and was on track to reach just percent of their retirement income needs Those needs include food shelter and medical care The study also found that percent of participants across all generations were saving less than percent of their salaries for retirement That s especially troubling when considering financial planners often advise men and women to save to percent of their salaries for retirement Some simple arithmetic and an examination of assets including retirement accounts and savings can shed light on how rosy or bleak a person s retirement looks Young professionals have time to make up for their indiscretions but men and women over who haven t saved enough for retirement must get to work immediately to ensure their retirement years are comfortable The following are a handful of ways men and women can catch up on retirement savings catch up on retirement savings is to start spending less Men and women over know that the sand in their earnings hourglass is running out and those behind on retirement savings need to make the most of their earnings in the years ahead That means cutting out any unnecessary expenses so that money can be used to save for retirement Examine all of your monthly and annual expenses to find ways to trim some fat You many want to downsize your vehicle to a less expensive and more fuelefficient make and model Golfers can cancel their country club memberships in favor of golfing on more affordable public courses that don t charge hefty annual membership fees Slashing spending won t be easy but doing so is the first step toward catching up on your retirement savings sponsored retirement plan If you have not been contributing the maximum amount to your employer sponsored retirement plan start doing so This is especially beneficial if your employer matches your plans should not drastically affect your take home pay now if the plan is a pre tax plan like a k women over the age of to make annual catch up contributions up to These contributions must be made to a retirement plan via elective deferrals and there are additional requirements as well Men and women over interested in making catch up contributions to their retirement accounts can learn more at www irs gov counts Though it s best to put as much money into tax advantaged accounts if you are already maxing out your contributions to such accounts it s still good to sock away money into a traditional taxable savings account It s unwise to expect your retirement accounts to fully fund your lifestyle in retirement so you will need or at least want a substantial amount of money in savings The benefit here is the money you put into traditional savings accounts has already been taxed so you won t incur any bills from the tax man once you begin to use that money down the road ideal for men and women with a target retirement date in mind postponing the day you call it quits is another way to catch up ment allows you to build a more substantial retirement portfolio while also decreasing the amount of time you will need to rely on that money This gives you more flexibility in retirement In addition Americans who work longer can increase their Social Security benefit because working longer should allow them to delay the day they start taking Social Security payments Men and women who can wait until age to accept such payments will receive larger monthly payments as a result Studies have shown that men and women are simply not saving enough to finance their retirements But there are myriad ways for those over to start catching up",1

Given an increase in administrative fees, new non-academic buildings and losses of federal and state funding for higher education, this rise in cost is expected to continue.

So how are students supposed to pay for their education, and what risks are associated with this rapidly-expanding market? For many students the answer to that question lies in some form of student loans However the amount of loans currently outstanding is daunting as of January outstanding student debt was at trillion That s billion larger than the outstanding auto loans trillion larger than the level of outstanding credit card debt and equivalent to percent of U S gross domestic product What form do these loans take Unlike with most debt products the majority of student loans are created and held by federal banks Of that trillion dollar market percent is composed of federal student loans The remaining percent comes from a mix of private banks and loan agencies When deciding how to select a student loan the biggest consideration should be given to the interest rate Many private loans have variable rates meaning the interest you pay differs depending on an economic indicator of the loan creator s choosing usually the London Interbank Offered Rate or Secured Overnight Financing Rate These indicators are used to determine most of the loan rates around the world and they usually increase with fears around inflation Now this can be highly beneficial if you want to have low interest rates as rates can drop extremely low in certain economic conditions and lead to a cheaper loan payment However the rate can also swing upward and your loan payment can end up being much higher than expected Currently possible interest rates on variable rate private loans range from percent to percent With federal loans a fixed interest rate is used This fixed rate is set by Congress and does not change over the lifetime of the loan This fixed rate is set by taking the yield on a year Treasury note and adding a management fee with the fee being lower for undergraduate borrowers and higher for graduate students and parents Currently the undergraduate rate is set to percent graduate to percent and parents to percent In suit with the private loans the year Treasury note yield also increases with inflationary fear Inflation also affects the real rates of the loans The real rate is the inflation adjusted rate for your loan For example if you had a loan with an interest rate of percent and inflation is percent over the time of repayment then the real rate of your loan is percent This may benefit borrowers with fixed rates as inflation can slowly eat away at interest paid Variable rates however adjust with inflation leading to no real rate benefit So if you re relatively risk averse and want to know how much your loans are going to cost make sure to stick with a federal loan or a private fixed loan Otherwise you could be stuck paying much more than you had expected or planned for if inflation fears rapidly increase chief goon opinion dailytarheel com",1

Since you've joined the workforce, you might be paying back your loans as best you can. But can you gradually reduce your debts while still putting money away for your long-term goals - such as retirement? Of course you might think it s premature to even think about retiring since you probably have decades to go before you say goodbye to the working world But the sooner you begin saving and investing for retirement the more time you ll have for your money to grow Plus your early start will help you avoid having to play catch up later Still it can be challenging to juggle payments for student loans and contributions to a retirement account especially if your loans are sizable How can you meet these two separate demands on your income To begin with you may have some flexibility in how you repay your student loan Although you might have selected or were assigned a repayment plan when you first begin repaying your student loan you can typically change this plan to accommodate your financial situation You ll need to contact your loan servicer for details on adjusting your repayments In any case though if you have a large student loan it s safe to say that you will be paying it back for quite some time So rather than wait for this debt to be cleared before you start saving for retirement think about how you can take action now For one thing take full advantage of your k or similar employer sponsored retirement plan This type of plan certainly offers some key benefits Your earnings can grow on a tax deferred basis and you typically contribute on a pretax basis which means the more you put in the lower your taxable income Plus you can fund your plan with a variety of investment choices But for you perhaps the biggest benefit is that your employer simply takes the money from your paycheck before you get it and puts it into your account You don t have to pay all your bills first and then hope you still have something left to invest it s already been done for you Ultimately contributing to your k can be a painless way of investing and it may make it easier psychologically at least for you to pursue the two goals of paying your college debts and saving for the future If you don t have a k or similar plan you can still follow the same principle of essentially freeing yourself from initiating investment moves simply by setting up a bank authorization to automatically transfer money from your checking or savings account into an IRA which offers some of the same features as a k You can start with relatively small amounts perhaps as little as per month and increase your contributions as your income rises As you well remember college wasn t cheap And you don t want to make it even more costly by having your student loan payments interfere with progress you can make toward your retirement funding goals So think about automating the contributions to your retirement accounts The effort or rather the effortlessness on your part can be well worth it This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor",1

The next step in the process is to understand your retirement plan These plans can vary and yours may be different from your neighbor s Does your employer plan offer a matching contribution Is there a profit sharing contribution Do you have to wait a period of time until your employer contributions are yours to keep known as a vesting schedule In a pinch can you borrow from your employer plan This is not recommended but it is good to know just in case there are no alternatives Instead of borrowing do you have the ability to take hardship withdrawals Can you take in service withdrawals at any point Does the plan have a Roth k option The answers to these questions may be found in a document called the Summary Plan Description Review your retirement savings plan contribution rate at work Are you contributing enough to get the maximum match available Can you increase the percentage by You might consider saving any salary increases you receive during the year into the plan It is the consistency of savings over time that will built your retirement nest egg You probably have your retirement assets invested in a certain way such as according to a target asset allocation Given the market turbulence your portfolio may have drifted away from your target But before you rebalance ask yourself this Does your current asset allocation meet your goals Regardless of whether or not you keep your existing allocation or adopt a new one you need to make sure your asset mix is appropriate for your situation If it is then you can proceed with selling assets in overweight classes and buying assets in the underweight classes This can be done all at once or over time Before making changes be sure to review the tax consequences Keep in mind that rebalancing is a risk control measure and not a guarantee that you will make money It also makes sense to review your savings in light of your current tax picture Some plans such as a traditional IRA or k give you a current tax deduction for contributions that you make The caveat here is that the money is then taxed when you withdraw the funds Other plans such as a Roth IRA or Roth k don t give you any current tax benefit but enable you to withdraw the funds tax free if certain conditions are met Which should you choose If you feel you might be in a higher tax bracket during retirement you might want to choose a Roth type of plan Alternatively if you feel your tax bracket will be lower in retirement you might choose a traditional IRA or k If you are young and just starting out the tax deduction may not mean that much to you In this case you might want to choose a Roth IRA for years of tax free earnings and the potential for tax free withdrawals during retirement Another strategy is to hedge your bets and contribute to both types of plans In any event given the choices you face you may want to discuss the specifics of your individual situation with a certified financial planner",1

Tracked by the Federal Reserve, this metric plots workersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ accumulated assets over their incomeÃ¢â‚¬â€the higher the ratio, the bigger their financial cushion. Researchers found that workers wealth to income trajectory has held steady over the years ending in when various factors including the drop in workers covered by pensions meant it needed to increase in order for workers not to lose ground They should have more wealth to compensate and they don t said Anthony Webb senior research economist at the Center for Retirement Research In the average to year old had accumulated wealth equal to about three times his income slightly below the level of Wealth includes all financial assets such as k balances and home equity income includes wages plus earnings and returns on financial assets This metric excludes the future value of employer pensions and Social Security There s no magic ratio to guarantee that people will meet their retirement goals Webb said Wealth to income adequacy depends on a number of factors including lifetime earnings health status and willingness to economize The Center for Retirement Research simply highlights a disturbing trend today s workers should be accumulating more than prior generations yet they aren t Today s workers should be socking away more for retirement because the decks are stacked against them in ways that they weren t years ago In percent of all private sector workers had pensions as their sole retirement plan benefit by that number had dropped to percent according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute Back in the early s double digit interest rates meant that it was possible for many retirees top live comfortably off of bond income Social Security Changes to Social Security mean that boomers will receive a lower replacement rate that is the percentage of pre retirement income that the benefits replace than current retirees And yet people are living longer than ever before so future retirees will need to stretch their nest eggs longer than prior generations What s more out of pocket health care costs are eating up an increasing share of retirees incomes at a time when fewer workers have employer sponsored retiree health care benefits to make up the difference between what Medicare covers and what they owe A recent analysis by HealthView Services a Danvers Mass based provider of health care cost data and planning tools projected that for a year old couple retiring in years at age health care costs will gobble up approximately of their lifetime Social Security benefits This sobering state of affairs won t be immediately obvious to the couple who at will likely still be in relatively good health But health care costs typically rise at around to a year and most people consume more of these increasingly pricey services as they age Meanwhile Social Security s annual inflation raise based on a broad basket of goods and services known as CPI W won t keep pace The gap grows over time to the detriment of older Americans Between and the CPI W lagged the inflation experienced by households aged and older by on a cumulative basis according to the J P Morgan Guide to Retirement s analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data Standard of living to fall The Center for Retirement Research uses Federal Reserve data as the basis for its National Retirement Risk Index This index measures the likelihood of households to achieve the same standard of living in retirement as they had while working Their analysis found that about half of American households will be unable maintain their standard of living in retirement This will mean a series of trade offs at best and sacrifices at worst It s one thing to accept a slightly reduced standard of living say to be forced to downsize to an apartment when you d rather remain in the family home It s quite another to have to choose between keeping the lights on and buying medicine or food To be sure rosier predictions exist on Americans retirement readiness But these typically rest on rosy assumptions Studies projecting that Americans are saving enough for retirement typically assume that people will reduce their spending after their children leave home according to the Center for Retirement Research brief Under these projections parents do not spend more on themselves when their children become financially independent Instead they sensibly plow the money they used to spend on their offspring into their retirement fund Then when they retire they continue to spend less than they did when their children were at home Some retirees will surely follow this prudent pattern but plenty won t Nitty gritty By contrast the wealth to income ratio is a neutral gauge that doesn t assume a specific behavior And what it shows is troubling according to the Center for Retirement Research Harold Evensky a financial planner and professor of practice at Texas Tech University said he gets into nitty gritty retirement planning once clients get within five years of that milestone Before clients reach that stage his standard advice is to save as much as they can Evensky who is

The City Council should simply reject the mayor s proposal as illegal under the provision of the Florida Statutes that any collective bargaining agreement shall not provide for a term of existence of more than three years Then a court would decide on the legality of the negotiations In the meantime the City Council should create a plan for the Police and Fire Pension Fund with the following provisions to be effective on Oct Drop the DROP Plan This is not in the public interest Make the early retirement service requirement years and offer percent of the pension at that milestone The pension benefit should reach percent at year and then would increase only as a percentage of the pay level increases after that point The city would require employees who expect to retire before Oct to contribute percent to the retirement fund and the city to match this amount The city would require employees who expect to retire on or after Oct to contribute percent to Social Security and percent to the retirement fund with the city matching these contributions Require a return of only percent on the fund The additional years of required service and a pension deferral should make up for the lower performance requirement Defer pension payments on all able bodied early retirees to age This will again decrease the required amount needed for the fund and help to keep the return on investment requirement lower The requirements for the five members of the Police and Fire Pension Fund Board should be changed to require one member from the police one member from the firefighters two citizens who do not receive and will not receive any civil service benefits as well as the City Council Auditor The city would win any litigation and the unions would lose from a standpoint of being unable to maintain their current contract through the period of litigation Let the unions sue the city if they really want to waste millions of their own dollars Bruce A Fouraker Jacksonville",1

All I had to do was keep my job. The investment is my pension and retirement plan at work And the company I work for pays for everything What an easy way to save Although savings are made up of many different components retirement programs represent a large part says a September study by the Employment Benefit Research Institute in Washington D C No kidding In employer pensions paid U S retirees more than billion in benefits almost percent more than the billion they received from Social Security Thousands in benefits As a rule the longer you work at a place the higher your pension benefits Job hoppers may be losing thousands of dollars in pension benefits It is something that should be taken into account when moving around said Richard Hinz of the U S Department of Labor s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration There are two main types of pension plans defined benefit and defined contribution Defined benefit plans pay you a set amount usually based on years of service and average salary in my case my average salary during the last five years In a defined contribution plan the company employee or both contribute so much the payout depends on how well the money is invested At my company I have the best of both worlds a defined benefit plan that lets me accumulate years of service through and a defined contribution plan that began three years ago in which the company kicks in about percent of my salary each year to a tax deferred account That s in addition to a k plan in which the company matches part of the money I put in If I had quit three years ago my defined benefit plan would have entitled me to receive a month at age If I left today I would receive a month based on three more years of service and a higher average salary Assuming I could make percent on my money I would have needed about three years ago and today to get that kind of income at age And even if I never get another raise my benefit would go up to a month if I work until I am the equivalent of having in cash and making percent a year Meanwhile the defined contribution account is already worth close to I could take the money if I left today Growing benefits But why leave The incentive to stay is big The defined contribution account based on just a percent annual rate of return will grow to more than if I hang on until I am It is very important to take a look at the entire compensation package rather than only the salary Hinz said The value of many parts of the compensation package may not be readily apparent nor is the potential loss of accumulated benefits But there is a loss U S Department of Labor figures show the average worker who switches jobs loses more than percent of his defined benefit pension Generally there is no loss in benefits in a defined contribution plan If the employee is fully vested he can take the money in a lump sum and roll it over to a tax deferred plan But only about percent of workers who receive unplanned lump sum distributions roll over the entire amount and just an additional percent roll over part of it Most people just spend the money Hinz said It is a loss in the sense that it is no longer available for retirement And in most cases there is a percent tax penalty if you are under years of age Of course employees are becoming a lot more aware of retirement health and other benefits now that downsizing has cut an estimated million people from corporate payrolls since I know tons of people who through no fault of their own are leaving their jobs I don t know anyone who is leaving voluntarily said Cindy Hounsell staff attorney for the Pension Rights Center in Washington D C a non profit advocacy group The bottom line Workers should be aware of what their pension benefits are and consider them before switching jobs People that have jobs should appreciate them and know what they have Hounsell said Humberto Cruz welcomes questions and comments from readers Although he cannot respond to each one individually he will answer those of general interest in his column Write to Savings Game c o Press Telegram Pine Ave Long Beach Calif",1

""With interest rates so low, I will lose money owning bonds after tax and inflation."" Preferred Shares have not performed very well over the past few years so I don t want those What often comes next is a question similar to If I don t want to put money into those do you have anything else you might recommend As it turns out we do have a lot that we would recommend and it generally comes under the category of alternative investments which are not publicly traded on markets Most of the investments that we have in this area have been providing steady returns in the six percent to per cent range annually over the past several years Before you think that these are some strange and extreme types of investments it is worth noting that according to Benefits Canada almost per cent of Canadian pension plans are now invested in alternative investments The plan managers are doing this for all of the reasons raised in the opening three quotes They are worried about volatility and risk adjusted returns from stocks They are especially concerned that in a low interest rate world the plans can t generate the required returns with only traditional conservative government or high quality corporate bonds While alternative investments include infrastructure commodities and private equity much of our investment focus is in the areas of private debt and real estate In a nutshell private debt is lending that is not done by traditional banks and does not include bonds traded on public markets Ever since the banking landscape has changed and their lending strategy narrowed This left many companies and individuals who required debt to look for alternative sources of funds Over the past decade private debt has grown over four fold and is now close to US trillion in assets globally according to the alternative credit council Our real estate investments meanwhile tend to be focused on managers that lend to developers and building owners and who have a global reach To help understand the increase in interest in alternative investments and why the returns are higher than most publicly traded bonds here are some examples of how private debt works In some cases the borrowers can be higher risk than traditional banks are comfortable with but often the borrowers fall into a variety of buckets that banks can t or won t service for other reasons Examples include a business that requires a loan to close an acquisition The business may be a perfect candidate for a loan but requires the funds in three weeks while a traditional bank may take three to six months to approve it Eventually the company may shift its borrowing to a bank at lower rates but in the short term the company is fine paying a high interest rate for the benefit of having the financing completed quickly In other cases a company may be in an industry that a bank may not lend to for reputational reasons but which might otherwise be a great candidate for lending For personal borrowers sometimes they are business owners with a lot of assets and good credit but low personal taxable income A bank may not give them a mortgage but a mortgage investment corporation may think they are a great loan candidate especially if they are only lending them per cent of the value of their house and the house is the first collateral on the loan In all of these cases the borrowing rates would be higher and often could be anywhere from six per cent to per cent depending on the situation It is these borrowing rates along with strong risk management practices and full collateral that can provide steady returns at rates much higher than public bonds These represent just a few examples of the many situations where someone is willing to borrow at high rates for the ability to get the lending that they require The benefits to the investor are significant First they provide investment diversification and very low connection or correlation to the stock market Second over the past five years many funds were not around prior to this returns have been quite steady with very low downside volatility Having said that a full investment cycle of to years would probably provide a little better test And third returns are often relatively high with many funds providing returns in the six per cent to percent range The main negative to private debt investments is that they are not very liquid While publicly traded securities are often easily sold daily many private debt investments might require anywhere from days to a full year to redeem This is one of the main reasons why private debt might only be one component of an overall portfolio Because the risks on lending are often only as strong as the operational skill of the manager and the security against the loan it is important to be able to assess whether any particular manager has top level skills to minimize the risk of losses While every person is different in the investing world we often have per cent to per cent of a clients overall portfolio invested in a diversified mix of private debt and other alternative investments If your portfolio is per cent invested in publicly traded investments it is worth noting that many wealthy individuals and most pension plans believe that you are making a mistake Now may be the time to consider looking beyond traditional investments to meet your longterm goals Financial Post Ted Rechtshaffen MBA CFP CIM is president and wealth adviser at TriDelta Financial He is hosting a webinar

With many facing wage cuts and added pressure on family finances due to the coronavirus crisis, some may be thinking about opting out of workplace pension saving. But ex pensions minister Sir Steve Webb now a partner at pension consultants LCP said people should check whether opting out will leave their family with less protection if they die He said death benefits vary according to the type of pension but in some cases particularly in the public sector opting out of the scheme can leave a worker with a much smaller lump sum payout for their family if they were to die Webb said that according to the latest Occupational Pension Schemes Survey there are about million public sector workers building up defined benefit pension rights and most of these would see reduced death benefits if they were to opt out There are million private sector workers building up similar rights He said Before making a decision to opt out of any type of workplace pension it is important to find out what death benefits you would be giving up",1

SAVING for children is more important than ever to parents and grandparents. They worry that, without solid savings, their offspring will end up in debt, burdened by top-up fees at university.    It is small consolation but part of what the Government takes away with one hand it will give back with the other through the Child Trust Fund Under this scheme to start in April next year all babies born since September will get an initial payment of at least Pounds to be invested for them until they reach the age of But this is not the complete answer to a child s needs and those born before September will not benefit anyway Here are ten things that every parent should know Children can get higher savings interest than you If a child will need savings in five to seven years cash deposits are the only safe option Look for the top interest rates Many banks and building societies offer better rates on smaller amounts to under s than they do to adults The best for instant access savings include Norwich Peterborough s Headstart II account per cent and Alliance Leicester First Save at per cent Isas for the young Equity Isas are for the over s only but at and they can have cash mini

commitments Friendly societies promote taxexempt plans as ideal for a child Low premiums are their most attractive feature the maximum that can be saved is Pounds a month or Pounds a year But they are usually invested in with profits funds so performance depends on bonus rates Another disadvantage is inflexibility Savings have to be for terms of at least ten years To cash in early risks getting back less than invested Children can invest in the stock market via a unit and investment trust plan Unit or investment trust regular savings plans are attractive Shares have produced better returns in the longer term than cash deposits Savings start from about Pounds a month and plans are very flexible they can be stopped and restarted sums added or withdrawn at any time without penalty Several

About two-thirds of the uninsured are under age 40. They use fewer health services, and their premiums are needed to help keep insurance costs down for everyone else. Yet the incentive structures in the law work at cross purposes with this goal and could well undermine its success It will all come down to costs Four out of five people under age will face higher premiums than without the Affordable Care Act even with the subsidies many can receive The law requires young people to pay more for their health coverage so older people can pay less A study published this year by the American Academy of Actuaries Contingencies magazine found that because of this provision premiums for younger healthier individuals could increase by more than percent Young men will pay even more than young women A former director of the Congressional Budget Office Douglas Holtz Eakin conducted a survey that showed fewer than half of young people will sign up for insurance if premiums rise by percent Young people also face a daunting approval process in applying for coverage Applicants must divulge their income family status and information about their employers details on any insurance offered at work and their health habits just to find out if they are eligible for subsidies Ezekiel Emanuel a key architect of the president s health plan says he is worried that young people will be bewildered and they may forgo purchasing health insurance and opt to pay a penalty instead That certainly will be an attractive option for many since the penalty starts at just the first year And there is yet another disincentive for young people to enroll in coverage they can wait to sign up for coverage until after they get sick or injured The law requires health insurance companies to sell insurance to anyone who applies But if young people don t sign up the insurance pools are likely to be composed primarily of people who have high health costs This could cause a death spiral where many more older and sicker people are enrolled causing health insurance premiums to rise to cover their medical costs thereby driving even more young people out of the market The White House believes that it will be able to persuade young people who overwhelmingly supported the president to enroll out of loyalty The president connects with young people too so he needs to use that bond and get out there to convince them to sign up for health insurance to help this central part of his legacy according to Emanuel a health care expert at the University of Pennsylvania But when it comes down to paying thousands of dollars for health insurance that they may not want or need that zeal may be severely tested Consider for example a year old person earning about a year He currently could buy health insurance for about a month However the new rules and more generous benefits required under the health law mean he would have to pay about a month instead He could get a subsidy of about a month but even with that he still would be paying nearly a year more for health insurance than without the law The White House is expected to mount a massive advertising campaign this summer to encourage people to enroll This will severely test his young supporters who are having the hardest time finding jobs in our economy Forcing them to also purchase health insurance and pay more for it may cool their enthusiasm to help the president fulfill his legacy Grace Marie Turner is president and founder of the Galen Institute which is funded in part by the pharmaceutical and medical industries McClatchy Tribune News Service",1
"You may have heard that timing is everything. And in many walks of life, that may be true - but not necessarily when it comes to investing.

To understand why this is so, let's look at three common mistakes investors make:","You may have heard that timing is everything. And in many walks of life, that may be true - but not necessarily when it comes to investing.

To understand why this is so, let's look at three common mistakes investors make: Selling investments and moving to cash when stocks are predicted to drop If you follow the financial news on cable TV or the internet you re eventually bound to discover some experts who are predicting imminent huge drops in the stock market And on rare occasions they may be right but often they re not And if you were to sell some of your stocks or stock based investments based on a prediction and move the money to cash or a cash equivalent you could miss out on possible future growth opportunities if the predictor was wrong And the investments you sold still could have played a valuable part in your portfolio balance Selling underperforming assets in favor of strong performers As an investor it can be tempting to unload an investment for one of those hot ones you read about that may have topped one list or another Yet there s no guarantee that investment will stay on top the next year or even perform particularly well Conversely your own underperformers of today could be next year s leaders Waiting for today s risk or uncertainty to disappear before investing Investing always involves risk and uncertainty Instead of waiting for the perfect time to invest you re better off building a portfolio based on your goals risk tolerance and time horizon All these mistakes are examples of a risky investment strategy trying to time the market If you try to be a market timer not only will you end up questioning your buy sell decisions but you also might lose sight of why you bought certain investments in the first place Specifically you might own stocks or mutual funds because they are appropriate for your portfolio and your risk tolerance and they can help you make progress toward your long term financial goals And these attributes don t automatically disappear when the value of these stocks or funds has dropped so you could end up selling investments that could still be doing you some good many years into the future While trying to time the market is a difficult investment strategy even for the professionals it doesn t mean you can never take advantage of falling prices In fact you can use periodic dips in the market to buy quality assets at more attractive prices Suppose for example that you invested the same amount of money every month into the same investments One month your money could buy more shares when the price of the investment is down meaning you re automatically a savvy enough investor to take advantage of price drops While your money will buy fewer shares when the price of the investment is up your overall investment holdings will benefit from the increase in price Buying low and selling high sounds like a thrilling way to invest But in the long run you re better off by following a consistent investment strategy and taking a long term perspective It s time in the market rather than timing the market that helps keep portfolio returns moving in the right direction over time This article was written by Edward Jones for use by your local Edward Jones Financial Advisor",1

I am interested in buying a flat above a shop but have been told it would
have to be a cash purchase because the property is on a floating freehold.
What does this mean? Jane Harrison at mortgage broker London & Country says:
Floating freehold probably refers just to the flat. Normally, a flat like
this would be leasehold and covered by insurance and maintenance agreements
that included the rest of the building. Agents sometimes refer to flying
freeholds. This means part of the property is built above land that is not
part of the freehold, such as a bedroom built above a shared passageway.



Either way, lenders are not keen to provide mortgages because of the risk
from actions by the downstairs freeholder. To find a mortgage, your best bet
is to shop around, particularly among local lenders who may be more willing
to help. Remember, mortgage problems may make it difficult to resell the
property later.

of the world What s important is to not get routinely ripped off and discover that you ve spent or more year after year on repairs that may not be essential AAA reports the average driver pays per year on maintenance and repairs which of course can vary based on the age of the car But if you are spending more than that ask yourself why And remember the nice service manager at your repair shop is in the sales business If your oil changes routinely end up costing you may want to consider breaking up with the shop The Medium Bills Are What Will Get You Transmissions fail and engines give up the ghost It happens Major repair bills often have as much to do with bad luck as anything else so I m not going to dwell on them This repair tech at Edmunds com revealed that shops often don t make that much money on big expensive and complex jobs Where the real financial win comes into play for them are on the medium sized jobs that are easy and can be done quickly They make money on brake jobs engine flushes and so on Keep that in mind for your next visit to the mechanic and you ll likely have more confidence as a consumer giving you an advantage Service advisors are wary of customers who look like they know what they re doing the shop worker told Edmonds com Just Say No Repair shops may tell you your bill is about to balloon and get your permission usually with some friendly language like You should really get this taken care of now But do you really need that transmission flush There s a big difference between dealer recommended service and manufacturer recommended service A good rule of thumb is to follow the later which you can find in service manuals and on carmaker websites Diagnostic Fees One of the most popular and lucrative gotchas at repair shops is the dreaded diagnostic fee a service charge for establishing the problem with your vehicle Sometimes it genuinely takes an hour or two to diagnose a repair problem But Kristin Brocoff of CarMD com said that it is also possible for techs to plug into the car s computer and get a diagnosis in seconds It takes less than two minutes for the service writer or tech to use a scan tool on your car Brocoff said If the problem ends up being something simple like a loose gas cap most shops waive or discount the diagnostic fee but some charge upwards of Ask a lot of questions and know what tests they re running on your car If you want to run a test yourself and compare your results to what a service tech is telling you you can purchase a OBD reader that can read the car s computer diagnostic codes It s important to note that the codes they generate don t always tell the whole story and they can be misinterpreted Brake for Second Opinions Car brake repairs range from simple and cheap brake pad replacement to the really expensive rotor and even caliper replacement It s easy for shops to say you need the expensive work when you could get away with the cheaper job They might even show you what looks like a terribly dirty worn rotor But rotors can be repaired turned instead of replaced for example If a shop tells you that you need a full brake replacement go to another shop and get a second opinion The variety of quotes you ll receive for repairs like this can be eye opening Last time I replaced my tires I was told I needed worth of repairs on my front brakes A month later they were fixed elsewhere for Smell Listen Look Feel This leads to perhaps the most important piece of gotcha fighting advice You have a relationship with your car Treat it like a friend and it ll do the same for you Listen to it look at it smell it feel it Listen to the sounds it makes Hear a sound like an airplane landing when you press on the brakes Take it in before a cheap repair becomes and expensive repair See a puddle stain in your parking spot Get help Smell something unusual when you turn it off Open the hood and look around Feel a drop in performance when you accelerate on a highway Notice a drop in gas mileage Take it in The most important way to avoid overpaying is to avoid the captive consumer situation A good rule of thumb You want to drive to a repair shop not get towed there Avoid letting things go until the situation is dire and it s not really possible to get second opinion quotes Question Line Items When Popular Mechanics interviewed an anonymous repair tech a few years ago he shared that many shops add annoying tack on fees like shop supplies That means you might be getting charged for a shop rag Feel free to ask and challenge the shop on these charges Doing so is fair and can put the shop on notice that you aren t a pushover Use Online Tools for a Reality Check Finally there are plenty of clever tools now that can give you a rough idea of what repairs should cost in your area Consumer Reports has one So does RepairPal com They won t be exact but you ll have a good idea if the quote you are getting is fair Also keep in mind that if the quote is too low ask questions to help make sure your shop isn t planning a bait and switch Even if you do avoid a car repair gotcha it s important to have an emergency fund so a pricey repair doesn t turn into unwanted debt Having outstanding or large debts can hurt your credit score and you ll want a strong score in the event that your car is damaged beyond repair and you need to get a new one Having a good credit

People were in danger of exhausting their savings and running out of money in old age, the Association of British Insurers said, as it called for new safeguards. In pension pots were completely emptied of money raising questions about whether savers were living beyond their means and exposing themselves to hardship later If the current rate at which many people are typically withdrawing cash from their pension pots continues then future pensioners will be at risk of running out of money in retirement the ABI said The coalition government delighted savers and stunned the pensions industry when it announced that from April people would be allowed to take their entire pension pots in cash from the age of Ministers said at the time that people should be allowed to do what they liked with their money including buying a Lamborghini if that is what they wanted The rule changes also made it easier for people to keep their pots invested in the share market even after retiring Previously strict rules meant that most people at retirement used their pots to buy an annuity a guaranteed income for the rest of their lives The ABI said that five years on it was clear that the reforms had placed much greater responsibility on the shoulders of savers to ensure they made the right choices Further reforms and safeguards were needed it said as too many people were making complex and vital retirement decisions without help According to data from the Financial Conduct Authority per cent of people who accessed their pension pots in did so without regulated advice or guidance Full withdrawals from pension pots had risen to their highest level since the freedoms were introduced the ABI said Some per cent of withdrawals were at an annual rate of per cent of the pot which was not sustainable and could leave some people with nothing in older age The freedoms only apply to so called defined contribution pensions which are now the norm in the private sector Public sector workers in more generous defined benefit schemes were not directly affected Baroness Altmann a former Conservative pensions minister cautioned that the ABI might be exaggerating the danger She said Most people have several pension funds and if they are withdrawing one but still have others they will not be at risk in the way suggested We just don t know and proper analysis is urgently needed to see the full picture People on average have different employers over a lifetime so couples in future could conceivably accumulate pots plus two state pensions The ABI called for the government backed Money and Pensions Service to offer later life reviews to help people prepare for retirement It also called for a retirement commission to devise policy to produce better retirement outcomes The report came as the Department for Work Pensions issued a report hailing the success of a parallel pensions reform of the last decade the nudging of millions of people into pension saving for the first time through automatic pay packet deductions Since it began in million people have been automatically enrolled in workplace pension schemes The government backed National Employment Savings Trust the default scheme now had million members The April rise in minimum employee deductions from per cent of annual pay above to per cent had had only a modest impact it said with opt out rates only showing a small increase as a result",1

In Maryland, where homeowners must apply for assistance by Friday, figuring out who qualifies for help has become an urgent, all-consuming enterprise. The state's housing agency has hired temps, conscripted division heads to do data entry, and asked employees to stay late and work weekends to attack piles of paperwork that have grown exponentially as the deadline loomed. About Marylanders struggling to hold on to their homes have applied including hundreds who turned out for a mortgage assistance workshop in Prince George s County which has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the state An additional sought help in Virginia where the deadline to apply for the program passed Thursday and eligibility is being determined by the federal government rather than the state District homeowners participate in a separate program that does not have an immediate deadline Many of those seeking help from the Emergency Mortgage Assistance Program as it is known in Maryland will not qualify because they do not meet its long list of requirements Their frantic scramble comes amid signs that the number of foreclosures which had slowed dramatically after problems surfaced with how lenders were processing the paperwork could begin rising again The number of U S homes with an initial default notice the first step in the foreclosure process rose percent in August from July foreclosure listing firm Realty Trac said Roseanna Vogt is desperate to avoid losing her Calvert County home She was among scores of homeowners who made the trek to the state Department of Housing and Community Development in Crownsville on Thursday to hand deliver her mortgage assistance application She said she has been looking for work since she was laid off by a nonprofit group more than a year ago She recently divorced and as part of the settlement took possession of her house in Chesapeake Beach But without a job she cannot afford the mortgage payments Her ex husband had been covering them but recently told her that he was going to stop She has lived in the house for years and has left to pay off Things have gotten so bad for me I don t have a vehicle anymore she said It is sitting in the driveway I don t have the money to fix it She came to drop off her application with a friend Susan Prentice of Huntingtown a widow with cerebral palsy who is trying to stay in her home even though her lender Fannie Mae has foreclosed on it The mortgage assistance program part of last year s financial regulatory legislation offers bridge loans to homeowners who have fallen behind on their mortgages and have lost income because of the recession The loans are to help cover mortgage payments for up to two years or a maximum of The U S Department of Housing and Urban Development distributed the money based on state unemployment rates It gave million to Maryland and almost million to Virginia The District through a separate federal program received almost million to help jobless homeowners facing foreclosure The money must be committed by the end of the fiscal year Sept leaving state and federal officials little time to review the applications The process can take minutes or several weeks depending on whether there are gaps in the paperwork One HUD official likened the scene at the federal agency which is handling the Virginia applications to April in an accountant s office The underwriters must not only crunch numbers but also read hardship letters which the applicants are required to submit The letters offer a glimpse of the recession s toll on people s lives Sometimes they go into a lot of stuff that has nothing to do with the loan They just want to get stuff off their chest anger at a lender an ex spouse said Bill Milko a senior underwriter They want to tell you their life story said Donna Mitchel another senior underwriter Sometimes being candid can backfire One purpose of the letters is to help underwriters verify that mortgage payment problems are rooted in the economic downturn and not some other reason Underwriter Brian Woodley recalled one letter that began Our story begins in well before the recent recession The underwriters say they feel sympathy for the applicants Milko was unemployed for more than a year before he came to work for the state Like a couple of his colleagues he is a casualty of the mortgage industry meltdown Woodley went through a layoff and a divorce a few years ago Sensitivity matters because in a small number of cases deciding who gets a loan involves judgment calls The criteria are strict The applicants income must have fallen by at least percent And they must be able to show that once the loan is gone they can resume payments That means the underwriters have to turn down many people who need help such as an elderly person on a fixed income You can see where they need the help but they won t be able to increase their income Woodley said Milko added In the real world we know that s a hardship but to HUD it s not Downstairs Juanita Cage Lewis a customer service manager and ombudsman for the state housing agency wrapped up a phone call with an Annapolis woman who was not able to print the application Lewis promised the woman who was driving over that she would print her a copy and hand it to her The phone at Lewis s desk has been ringing continuously for the past few days with calls about the assistance program including from people who had already been rejected The underwriters have gotten so busy reviewing applications they can no longer take calls from applicants So Lewis has become the buffer She s learned to just listen They tell me about their mother and father They re living with a disabled child she said Then her phone rang That s

The revised estimate to the shortfall, now $1 billion over the next 18 years, will be issued only days before city voters decide whether to opt out of a state law that locks in certain pension benefits. We re not saying it s going to be pretty Michael Carter of Gabriel Roeder Smith Co told the board He declined to be more specific In February the board and its old actuarial firm predicted Houston could make generous improvements to its nonpolice nonfirefighter pension benefits and not pay more than percent of its payroll each year to keep the pension fully funded The estimate has steadily risen to percent of payroll or about million extra next year from taxpayers rising later to million extra per year That s partly because thousands of city workers have switched from a less lucrative noncontributory pension plan to a contributory plan that provides significantly higher benefits When the pension improvements were pending before the Legislature in the percent prediction assumed that no workers would switch plans In a subsequent estimate the actuary duly noted that many employees had switched plans in the previous year helping drive up the shortfall but never predicted that employees would continue to switch The workers have switched by the thousands And District Attorney Chuck Rosenthal has confirmed that he is investigating whether the lack of the forward looking assumption was purposeful and possibly criminal since it helped cause the city to agree to benefit changes that enriched some members of the pension board and their executive director along with other city employees The subject is complex but so is the May election Voters are being asked by Mayor Bill White to approve Proposition which excuses Houston from a new state law that bars cities from reducing pension benefits already earned by employees The law would still allow cities to reduce pension benefits not yet earned That has prompted employee groups to charge that White by wanting to excuse Houston from the law must want to reduce benefits for those who are nearing retirement or have already retired White counters that he must have flexibility to negotiate changes to the plan that might not be possible because of a poorly worded state law City workers are not comforted by his trust me assertions said Fred Holmes board chairman of the Houston Municipal Employees Pension System The city s main pension fund has two major plans one in which employees contribute nothing and one in which they contribute percent of their paychecks Before the changes a year employee in the noncontributory plan would have gotten a percent pension After the changes it rose only slightly to percent In contrast before the changes in the contributory plan a year employee would have gotten percent of salary reflecting the value of his own contribution After the changes the percentage rose to percent Employees are allowed to switch from the noncontributory plan to the contributory one which costs taxpayers more money They can retroactively buy previous years by paying percent of the salary they earned in that year plus percent interest Before the changes few employees switched to the contributory plan But afterward percent of all noncontributory employees switched in the first year and another percent switched in the second Nearly half who switched purchased credit for previous years an average of years each and the rest can still purchase back years anytime before they retire Since the pension shortfall became news this year the number of employees switching to the more lucrative plan and buying back years has actually increased The pension s new consultant said that it would be safe to assume that percent of employees in the noncontributory plan will be switching to the contributory plan in the next several years Virtually all of them will purchase some previous service years before they retire he said He requested that the board ratify the changed assumptions before he used them since they are the board s responsibility he said Since pension board members oppose White s effort to get out from under the new state law it would not help their cause to release any new more negative shortfall numbers just before the vote But they have little choice White and the city hired their own actuarial firm to make a new estimate and that number will be released before the election The pension board now will have a number to compare to the city s by May or May We re ready to get this show rolling and help out Holmes said acknowledging that something must be done to stem the funding crisis White cannot change the pension on his own He must negotiate an agreement with the pension board or get changes approved by the Legislature Holmes said he was optimistic and sounded conciliatory There are a lot of ways once we get to the table to solve these problems he said",1
"Despite the stock market's all-too-recent dive, middle-class families managed to accumulate more wealth in recent years, largely because home values soared and those homes' owners apparently resisted the temptation to borrow out all their increased equity, according to a new study of Federal Reserve data.  

Households with incomes between $20,000 and $80,000 in 2001 dollars saw their net wealth rise 23 percent from 1995 to 2001, and the share of those families spending less than their income and saving regularly rose, according to the study, sponsored by the Consumer Federation of America and Providian Financial, a credit card and financial services firm.  ","Despite the stock market's all-too-recent dive, middle-class families managed to accumulate more wealth in recent years, largely because home values soared and those homes' owners apparently resisted the temptation to borrow out all their increased equity, according to a new study of Federal Reserve data.  

Households with incomes between $20,000 and $80,000 in 2001 dollars saw their net wealth rise 23 percent from 1995 to 2001, and the share of those families spending less than their income and saving regularly rose, according to the study, sponsored by the Consumer Federation of America and Providian Financial, a credit card and financial services firm.   Despite the apparent increase in prudent financial behavior however these families on average have net wealth of only including their home equity not enough to meet major emergencies and certainly not enough to provide a comfortable retirement Half the families say they are worried about their financial situation and they are right to be said CFA Executive Director Stephen Brobeck Women the middle aged and those living in the northeastern and north central states are the most worried Brobeck noted These are areas where manufacturing jobs provide much of the employment and often the best jobs available for blue collar workers and the manufacturing sector has been hit hard by foreign competition Last week for example Carrier Corp the big refrigeration equipment division of United Technologies Corp said it would close all its manufacturing operations in Syracuse N Y and lay off workers Jobs like these typically are ones that offer blue collar workers defined benefit pensions Those are the traditional pensions that are taken care of entirely by the employer without requiring the worker to make investment decisions and that provide a lifetime stream of income in retirement Not only are such pensions less available to younger workers today but layoffs that truncate an older worker s career generally result in a lower pension as well It is not clear where families in the middle class are headed Highly skilled workers or those in growth fields such as health care continue to work for good wages but others struggle The CFA and Providian are pushing a nationwide savings program to encourage financial services firms to embed savings services in their offerings and to encourage individuals and families to save Pilot programs in Cleveland and a number of other cities have yielded positive results but it remains to be seen if the initial enthusiasm they have generated will be sustained The program is offering free enrollment online at www americasaves org It will ask you to set a goal and work out a plan to achieve it The program also provides free information about saving and saving options It is clear that the middle class needs to save and invest more The Fed data indicate that outside of rising home equity not a whole lot of that is going on It is equally clear that saving at these income levels particularly the lower end of the range isn t easy While inflation has remained under control in recent years family incomes haven t done much either other than at the high end And despite the attention given to the recent federal income tax cuts the overall tax burden on families especially property and sales taxes remains high In fact while assets per se are rarely taxed in the United States property taxes in most states are structured so that if your housing wealth rises through appreciation your taxes go up with it Primary residences get very favorable tax treatment when sold for a married couple up to in gains can escape tax entirely but if you don t sell you may have to pay a percentage point or more of that additional value every year in property tax Investors who own stocks on the other hand can hold unrealized capital gains for many years without paying any tax on them Only when such winnings are cashed in are taxes imposed The study found that only about half of middle class families own stock at all and the median value of those holdings was just in This means as the CFA pointed out that three quarters of middle class households held less than combined in individual stocks stock mutual funds and stock retirement funds This did spare them much of the pain of the recent market plunge but it raises serious doubts about their retirement prospects The bottom line for families is a simple but not easy choice Hold spending below income save and invest or figure on working well into old age Oh and one other thing if you do scrimp and save and do the right thing there s still no guarantee that you ll have enough More than percent of U S households owned individual retirement accounts as of June according to the Investment Company Institute a mutual fund trade group That brought the total to million households with IRAs up million from a year earlier About million of these were Roth IRAs which are not deductible but are tax free in retirement an increase of percent In addition to the rise in Roth IRA ownership the number of U S households that owned traditional IRAs rose to an estimated million from million a year earlier It is possible for a household to hold both types Nearly two thirds of IRA households included mutual funds in their IRAs typically stock funds Thirty eight percent of IRA households held individual stocks in their IRAs The median age of heads of households owning IRAs was The median annual income of such households was with median financial assets of of which was the IRA the ICI said For holders of traditional IRAs income was about the same but median financial assets which don t include home equity totaled with in the IRA The median is the midpoint of a group so half the IRA holders had more and half less At the end of last year assets in IRAs totaled trillion

There is a widespread belief that a government bribe to join the scheme announced in the Budget and designed to make New Zealanders save money may make people sign up but won t make them save The horror scenario for fund managers such as AMP is of people signing up then taking a perpetual contributions holiday until they can claim the government money when they retire Similarly young people might join to get a first home subsidy and once they have what they want leave the minimum in their account That would go nowhere towards creating a savings culture but would leave fund managers managing hundreds of thousands of accounts containing very little says Roger Perry general manager for savings and investments at AMP Financial Services For that to be economic Perry says the government would have to let fund managers drop service levels for small accounts for example not sending out annual statements But he was adamant KiwiSaver could be made to work Others are less optimistic Financial planner Jeff Matthews of Spicers doubts that KiwiSaver will have any effect on New Zealand savings habits And worse there is the threat of substitution people switching out of other savings plans into the KiwiSaver scheme without taking account of which offered a better investment option The funds offered to KiwiSavers are likely to be low quality and cheap and savers who took the might be ignoring better investment options elsewhere he said In of Kiwis saved in a super fund In that had fallen to Plans to let parents save for their children s tertiary education through KiwiSaver have been shelved Instead the government is finalising details of a subsidised stand alone scheme to be unveiled this year",1

"Proof that advisers play a critical role in boosting balances

Having an actual plan makes a big difference for achieving retirement goals, and having an actual adviser makes a big difference in having that plan, research indicates.","Proof that advisers play a critical role in boosting balances

Having an actual plan makes a big difference for achieving retirement goals, and having an actual adviser makes a big difference in having that plan, research indicates. Nearly a quarter of Baby Boomers report having no savings for retirement according to the IRI Fact Book from the Insured Retirement Institute IRI Among those Boomers who have retirement savings have balances below Citing a study by The Hartford Age of Opportunity Americans Transitioning Into Retirement the book notes that of retirees say if they could change just one aspect of their retirement it would be to save more money and be better prepared financially While automatic enrollment and auto escalation features in employer sponsored retirement plans have indeed boosted retirement savings the IRI contends that may still not be enough to ensure adequate reserves Individuals need to be more engaged in retirement planning the book argues and seeking help from a financial adviser is one of the most effective ways for workplace savers to become more proactive A number of factors e g the increased responsibility placed on individuals for structuring their own retirement income coupled with the recent headwinds from the financial crisis the subsequent recession and a slow economic recovery have created a set of economic conditions that have negatively affected the retirement savings behaviors of Baby Boomers the book says In a section titled Barriers to Saving the IRI examines some inhibitors to saving for retirement and how potential changes to tax policy can exacerbate them IRI researchers also explore how working with an adviser can help achieve desired levels of savings as well as how annuities can help as sustainable retirement income vehicles in the defined contribution DC plan context Key Findings The fact book s Barriers to Savings section reported the following regarding Boomers today have had difficulty paying their mortgage or rent in the past months have stopped contributing to a retirement plan said they would be less likely to save if capital gains taxes increased and stated they would be less likely to save if federal income taxes increased There are ways to overcome the barriers the book points out Those who work with an adviser and set up a plan tend to fare better Among Boomers who work with a financial adviser had determined a savings goal The IRI found that having a plan for retirement increases confidence levels Roughly half of the Baby Boomers with a plan prepared by an adviser said they were extremely or very confident they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement Nearly of Boomers who have consulted an adviser reported that they are very or extremely confident they will have enough money to live comfortably throughout retirement compared with who have not consulted a financial adviser In sum confidence levels rise when people have an adviser and soar even higher when the adviser designs a financial plan The IRI found that of the Boomers working with a financial adviser said that adviser prepared a retirement plan Middle Incomers Need Advice Vast majority have had no training on financial security in retirement Eighty three percent of middle income Baby Boomers have not had any type of formal training or education about topics related to retirement financial security a study finds According to a recent survey from the Bankers Life Center for a Secure Retirement of middle income Boomers receive no professional financial guidance of any kind whether formal or informal At the same time a majority somewhat doubt they will have enough savings to last throughout retirement The lack of education services and confidence may be attributed to a disconnect between the Boomers and financial professionals Bankers Life researchers suggest The survey shows that approximately four in Boomers with between and in annual income think they do not need advice because they prefer to make their own financial decisions The survey also finds that many middle income Boomers could have inadequate retirement plans due to the tendency of the financial services industry to cater to wealthy Americans Of Boomers without a financial professional have received no solicitations in the past year Bankers Life says and another have never been contacted by one Among Boomers having an active relationship with a financial professional sought out the relationships themselves while a mere say the relationship was initiated by the advice provider Still good relationships between middle income Boomers and financial professionals can have positive results Those who do turn to a professional generally have more saved for retirement More than one quarter who work with a financial adviser have investable assets of more than compared with only of those who do not work with one Middle income Boomers should realize that not all of those working with a financial professional start with high levels of assets according to Bankers Life The study shows that while nearly half of individuals who have worked with a professional for less than two years have under in investable assets of those who worked with one for years or more have over in investable assets PA Adult Children Undermine Retirement Six in American parents support their adult children financially according to a study from the LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute SRI Parents with Millennial children most often help to pay for cell phones and mobile service college expenses and loans rent or mortgage payments and even entertainment costs such as movies or sporting events The majority of Americans with adult children have at least one of them living at home the study found and nearly three quarters of parents whose children are to years old have at least one living with them While Millennials are the most educated generation in history nearly four in are unemployed and many more are underemployed says Deb Dupont associate managing director LIMRA Secure Retirement Institute Parents of Millennials even those over the age of are providing considerable support to their children at a time in their lives when saving for retirement should be a priority she adds Nearly half of parents who have supported their adult children financially in the past year report that this has negatively affected their retirement saving The study findings are based on a nationally representative survey fielded last July of Americans PA Retirement and Health Care The American Benefits Council advocates a long term outlook on both A new strategy outline issued by the American Benefits Council ABC suggests that the advocacy group will work to achieve public policy reform that more closely unifies health care and retirement concerns According to its new strategy manifesto the ABC expects recent trends in personal health and financial well being to gain steam in the medium and long term Over that time it anticipates individuals and employers will embrace a broader view of lifetime income protection which includes not only health coverage and retirement savings but also life insurance disability and long term care coverage in a much more integrated way The main driver behind focusing attention on the need to protect lifetime income through a total financial wellness approach the ABC says is that people s lives are getting longer while the U S pension system is covering a dwindling number of people Indeed according to data the council pulled from a recent U S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC report the average time spent in retirement has lengthened from years in to years today for men and from years to years for women over that same time period Meanwhile individuals retiring today can expect the cost of health care to grow annually through the end of their lifetime In developing a new strategic plan the ABC concludes that in the future the three main stakeholders in the benefits system will continue to be individuals employers and the government although the roles of each will evolve Additionally the council says the principle objective of employee benefits policy will remain helping individuals achieve personal financial security although that concept is perhaps now more accurately described as personal health and financial well being The council s new strategy outline also takes into account the growing importance of global competitiveness in retirement and health coverage offerings The spreading global footprint of the largest employers and the increasing globalization of markets and economies means global competition will dictate much of the design and perceived successes of employee benefit programs by the end of the next decade the ABC says Another major consideration for the council s strategic vision is that technological advances should be expected to keep accelerating Technologies available today make possible what was unimaginable just years ago when the ABC s last strategic vision document was issued the group says John Manganaro Need to Address Health Care Pre retirees lack an action plan The third annual Nationwide Retirement Institute survey found that the majority of respondents with at least in household assets say one of their top fears in retirement is of health care costs going out of control More than half believe the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA will increase those costs Fear is doing little to inspire these pre retirees to take action however More than two in five say they would delay their retirement if they had to buy their own health insurance Roughly one quarter of employed affluent Baby Boomers say they believe they will never retire Just two years ago most affluent Boomers surveyed expressed little concern over health care costs in retirement Last year that number rose and it jumped a bit higher this year with saying they believe it will be the biggest expense throughout retirement Still these worries can lead to a positive outcome says John Carter president of Nationwide s retirement plans business in Columbus Ohio They increase the conversations around paying for health care in retirement and can be a great starting point for advisers to help retirement plan participants assess and plan for those costs We believe there is a lack of clear understanding around the Affordable Care Act Carter says noting that four in consumers report believing the ACA will increase their retirement health care costs People are unaware of how much they will need for meeting expenses in retirement he feels and do not fully understand the entire benefits landscape a picture that includes Medicare Social Security benefits and long term care Their underestimation of what health care costs in retirement can lead to these fears Carter says and in the wake of such fear and confusion many participants fail to plan According to the survey just of Baby Boomers have discussed health care costs with a financial adviser It s not just about the assets you accumulate Carter says As the ACA has gotten more ink over the last year Nationwide s survey found that the percentage of pre retirees who feel confident to very confident that they know their personal benefits and who grasp the consequences of the ACA has increased from to However confusion still abounds Over three in five affluent pre retirees say they wish they had a better understanding of Medicare coverage Nearly two thirds of affluent pre retirees enrolled in Medicare did not know that the program does not cover long term care costs There is room for us to educate more Carter says The survey results yielded few surprises he says but it did highlight that insufficient knowledge around planning for health care expenses in retirement continues to challenge pre retirees The good news is that the ACA has pulled health care into the dialogue he says Advisers need to be ready to have this conversation and be proactive He recommends using all available expense planning tools and calculators such as Nationwide s Personal Health Care Assessment Further he stresses that advisers need to gain a thorough understanding of Medicare Social Security and the ACA and know the benefits Jill Cornfield Advisers Rely On Numerous Enrollment Strategies Mail received at home Video CD ROM or DVD Social media networking internal Social media networking external Targeted mailings Mobile devices Source Prudential Study of Employee Benefits The Financial Wellness Cachet Incorporating holistic financial planning is a competitive advantage Financial wellness programs can be a value add for advisers especially when they help drive retirement readiness and address the roots of participant inactivity Financial stress is widespread says Matt Iverson founder of Retiremap in San Francisco citing a recent survey by New York Life Retirement Plan Services that indicates three quarters of the population describe themselves as stressed or extremely stressed The cause More than half point to possible financial difficulties and worry about potentially unaffordable medical expenses We all say everyone should save more but if you can t afford to save more because of credit card debt so you can t retire at these things have an effect on the employee as well as the employer Iverson says In the face of this significant stress which does not seem to be going away Iverson notes the adviser is the main point of contact to address the problem with retirement plan participants either with phone support or by working with the plan sponsor to implement a program to help them identify and set goals Contributing to the problem of financial stress Iverson says is that we live in an age of relentless marketing People are constantly exposed to commercial messaging It s hard to extract yourself from the things that provide short term gratification he says adding that part of the adviser s job is to frame things so people can make the right decisions A financial wellness program can help create that environment and raise awareness around getting people to meet their goals Iverson says While plan design features definitely play a part in preparing participants to retire advisers can bring maximum benefit to the plan by offering programs that help participants recognize the financial behaviors that make them stand in their own way so to speak We can advocate for the participants to help get them where they need to be he says Some of people s top concerns are skyrocketing medical expenses probably the No expense Iverson says and among other macroeconomic trends stagnant wages People have to do more with less he observes and within a retirement plan an adviser might have to broaden the scope of topics to cover more than just investment options Moving from financial planning to workplace financial wellness programs is not a huge leap and the impetus is partly being driven by the employer It is increasingly common for human resources HR and benefits people to see the impact on work performance of their employees financial stress Iverson says They would like aging retirees to retire but sometimes they cannot afford to and many participants continue to work at a time when their benefits and salary are more expensive on average an additional to a year for people who cannot retire Education must be relevant to employees goals Advisers should use the communication strategies that will resonate with specific targeted populations Much of the communication should help them see if they are on track to meet financial goals broadly Iverson argues not just for retirement which is generally more of a concern for people close to that milestone Jill Cornfield Overlooked Factors Retirement planners may be missing several key dynamics There is a pretty long list of variables people commonly forget to consider in their retirement savings effort says David Blanchett head of retirement research for Morningstar in Chicago First I think a serious misunderstanding of life expectancy still exists today especially how life expectancy will change in the next or years as that will impact even the older generations of people in the k system right now he says As Blanchett observes most people are aware that modern medicine continues to improve the average length of peoples lives but few understand how truly significant this is from a financial planning perspective For a year old even a five year boost in life expectancy dramatically increases his lifetime income needs It s really important for people to ask themselves not just Will I be able to retire but also Can my nest egg last years Blanchett says It s not an exact statistic but the other thing is that people who have saved in a k plan successfully are not average Americans he says When you look at the data consistent retirement plan participants tend to be somewhat healthier and wealthier than people on average which has a positive impact on longevity Further complicating the problem Blanchett says many people back load their savings effort and plan to make up for lost ground late in their career when they expect to earn their highest wages But what happens to this outlook if you learn at that you can t work anymore he says or that you have to shift to a part time position Another piece of the retirement planning picture that often gets overlooked is the sequence of return risk associated with retirement portfolios Put simply the sequence of return risk arises from the fact that an individual has to leave the work force at some specific point and begin drawing on accumulated assets This can be a major problem if the anticipated retirement date comes during a deep market trough as it did for many during the Great Recession when they saw more than or of their portfolios evaporate over a short time Some people think converting to a cash portfolio might be the answer here but cash isn t exactly safe either he says An all cash portfolio right now is essentially posting a negative rate of return after you factor in inflation And if you re earning a negative rate of return after inflation for the first years of retirement you re never going to make it over the year retirements we ve been talking about You re inevitably going to have to take on some amount of risk Blanchett adds that there is also a tendency to overlook the fact that bond holdings are subject to sequence risk as well and these may not always be a safe investment The point he says is that getting too focused on one piece of the retirement picture be it health care or housing may be problematic John Manganaro Next Level Readiness Sponsors need to enhance auto enrollment features More than three quarters of large and midsize U S employers that sponsor k and b defined contribution DC plans say retirement readiness has become a major issue for their employees A survey by Towers Watson shows that a vast majority of plan sponsors have taken steps to boost employee retirement readiness through improved plan design and communications However not all plan sponsors are optimizing these strategies For example more than two thirds of companies offer automatic enrollment to at least some of their workers but far fewer automatically re enroll noncontributors or participants deferring less than the default amount Towers Watson claims employers have the opportunity to engage both slow and stagnant savers by using re enrollment Similarly of companies provide automatic escalation but only mandate it Among sponsors that automatically enroll some or all workers approximately two thirds offer automatic escalation of contributions with making it truly automatic Aside from auto enrollment and escalation the appeal of an employer match continues to be one of the single largest influencers of the amount and level of employee savings according to Towers Watson The company s North American Defined Contribution Plan Sponsor Survey found of plan sponsors offer a matching contribution to some or all of their workers One third of employees save at the match threshold and another third save more Knowing that many employees tend to save at the match level provides the opportunity for employers to reshape the match to encourage increased participant savings and improved retirement readiness Towers Watson states Fifty four percent of companies offer Roth features in their plans up from in the survey found Additionally of respondents are considering or planning to add Roth features by Of those that currently have a Roth provision also allow other after tax contribution options While post tax offerings have increased utilization of the strategy still remains low with only of highly compensated employees and of non highly compensated employees using Roth accounts to save Towers Watson suggests that organizations wanting to be proactive about driving up the use of their Roth provisions should target messages to employees not currently making such contributions The Towers Watson North American Defined Contribution Plan Sponsor Survey was conducted in June and July of last year among large and midsize U S companies that sponsor a defined contribution plan These companies sponsor k plans or b plans represent a range of industry sectors

Darcea Hiltz of Mississauga Ont wants my opinion of Asset Architect version The deadline for taxation year retirement saving plan contributions is just over a month away You should have received a notice from Revenue Canada last year advising you of your contribution limit But how do you know how much to invest in your plan today unless you figure out the nest egg you ll need when you retire The Asset Architect program from Mississauga s Speakman Todd Publishing Inc is designed to answer this question This specialized financial planning program for MS DOS computers can calculate the estimated future value of your financial assets and show you how much income your investments should bring you in today s dollars Suppose you believe you could retire today with an annual income of But you re and won t retire for another years Inflation means that you ll need a higher income when you retire By plugging in your inflation estimate Asset Architect will tell you your retirement income needs Enter your estimated rate of return and the program will calculate the amount you should invest every year to build up your investments The program makes it easy to change your inflation and investment return assumptions You can see how a seemingly minor change in the inflation rate can dramatically change your annual investment requirements For example in one scenario I changed the estimated inflation rate from per cent to per cent annually Yearly savings of were required with per cent jumping to with per cent inflation If you re planning your retirement income Asset Architect is a marvellous aid to calculate your needs The program comes with a day money back guarantee Ralph Sketchley of Hamilton writes I need to know where I might find used equipment Surely there must be some previously owned or type equipment around somewhere You can save a lot of money buying good used computer hardware The fast pace of technological change makes personal computers technically obsolete in five years or less However with proper maintenance they can operate for years or more Problems with electronics such as memory chips or microprocessors tend to occur early in their usage So most of the things that do go wrong when you buy a new computer happen in the first six months Apart from disk drives computers contain few of the moving parts that tend to break down with age So used computers are relatively reliable However I would not recommend buying a used printer Printers are chock full of gears and pulleys that get a lot of wear and tear LCC Computers Inc in Mississauga runs an active computer brokerage business in used IBM PC and PS computers They don t provide a catalogue because pricing in the used computer market fluctuates almost daily However they will provide quotations on any used IBM computer you want Dell Computer Corp recently opened a factory outlet store at their Canadian head office in Richmond Hill Ont The store offers reconditioned Dell computers and peripherals Used computers come with a day warranty Finally many computer dealers accept trade ins on the purchase of new equipment They usually don t display former trade ins on the sales floor but you can ask a sales rep to see what is available Richard Morochove C A is a Toronto based computer consultant Write to Computer Watch The Toronto Star Yonge St Toronto M E E",1

A physician trained abroad, Elizabeth, 42, pulls down $120,000 a year. Phil, 45, works in a related field and makes $90,000 a year.   

They would appear to have succeeded in adapting to their new country. They have a house with an estimated value of $730,000 and are keeping $135,000 in cash and guaranteed investment certificates. But there are problems with their financial life.    They took risks in leaving their country and now they are risk averters in the extreme They keep their registered retirement savings plans in GICs earning per cent a year and their taxable investments in bank accounts at per cent a year They have no registered education savings plan for their two children ages and We have been in Canada for only six years Phil explains But we want to send our kids to university and plan retirement Will we be able to afford to do that What our expert says Facelift asked Derek Moran a registered financial planner who heads Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with Phil and Elizabeth There are challenges Mr Moran explains Phil simply will not take risks with investments He has suffered equity losses and doesn t want to repeat them The most conservative investment strategy would be for the couple to pay off their mortgage balance as fast as possible with their monthly savings Once the mortgage is discharged they will be able to save a month In the next three years Elizabeth s income should rise to a year For now assuming that Elizabeth puts a year into her RRSP and that Phil puts into his RRSP that the couple expands their portfolio to include assets that can generate returns of per cent a year and that inflation runs at per cent a year then at Phil s age they will have in dollars in their RRSP At his age they would have However if they stick with their GICs earning per cent a year they would have at age Mr Moran estimates After their mortgage is paid off they will be able to save a month in the RRSPs and to put into cash investments If these taxable funds were to generate per cent a year after taxes and inflation the portfolio would rise to at Phil s age and at his age If the couple sticks with GICs and makes a zero return after taxes and inflation they will have a total portfolio equal to their initial savings plus inflation in dollars The after tax result could actually be negative depending on interest rates tax rates and inflation the planner notes Not only do Phil and Elizabeth have high tax exposure on their earned incomes they also fail to take full advantage of RRSP contribution room Their situation is made worse by their preference for GICs which are very safe but have low returns In the end they add to their tax problems by adding fully taxed interest income to their fully taxed professional incomes Given the couple s preference for staying in cash the course of least resistance is to pay down their mortgage The per cent they earn on GICs leaves per cent after tax and is actually a negative return once Alberta s brisk rate of inflation is taken in account Mr Moran says If they pay down their mortgage balance they will earn the per cent they pay in interest For Phil and Elizabeth this is a relatively attractive way to use their cash he adds The rest of their savings can be used to fill the couple s RRSP space Phil has of available contribution room Elizabeth has of space The contributions even if left in cash within the accounts would produce tax deductions of and respectively The next move should be to incorporate their separate professional incomes They each generate high cash savings after they pay their living expenses They could each have a company that would earn income then pay out salaries The salaries would be set to maximize their RRSP contributions Money retained in the company would be taxed at just per cent in Alberta They would have per cent of original undistributed corporate income to invest It is a better deal than investing the money after they have paid personal tax that leaves them with only to per cent of their pretax income Mr Moran says When retained earnings are eventually paid out they will be taxed as Canadian source dividends subject to lower taxes than ordinary earned income Deferral of personal taxes for many years effectively makes it possible to earn money on what can be regarded as the government s money Mr Moran notes It s rather late to start a registered education savings plan for the kids but Phil and Elizabeth could set up a family trust and pay out earnings from the corporations to be taxed in the hands of the children This plan requires that the children be years old They are likely to be in a zero tax bracket The family trust makes use of postponed contributions from existing savings There are no annual contribution limits either though the downside of the plan is that there is no Canada Education Savings Grant boost each year to parental contributions However tax savings more than offset the grant Mr Moran notes If Phil works to age he can expect per cent of the maximum Canada Pension Plan payment of a year and if he works to age Elizabeth would receive the same ratio and get at age and at age They will receive Old Age Security at age based on being in Canada for years out of the needed to qualify for full OAS benefits Under revised rules that would give Phil of the maximum of a year and Elizabeth of a year That works out to and respectively If the couple sticks with GICs for all of their investments their retirement income would be about at age If they expand their portfolio to half bonds and half stocks and generate a per cent annual return and retire at age they can expect retirement income of If they retire at age their income would be if they remain fully invested in GICs and if they use the half bond half stock portfolio the planner calculates This couple has the discipline to save and to build significant retirement savings Mr Moran says Their problem is to overcome their fear of loss in capital markets They may have some losses if they buy stocks and fixed income assets but they are certain to have losses of purchasing power if they

""Student loans may feel so burdensome to some borrowers that it's hard not to see them as a bad thing,"" said Tom Knickerbocker, executive vice president of Ameritech Financial. ""But successful repayment can help to not hinder financial success."" Debt is not necessarily bad though it may feel like nothing more than a burden Debt can sometimes help build wealth For example borrowing to buy a house may be a form of wealth building because of the combination of interest deductions and the fact that houses often increase in value over time to at least keep up with inflation so borrowers who sell the house later or rent it out will likely make a profit if they have owned the property for a long stretch Similarly student debt is often seen as good debt because it was used to boost earning potential as long as borrowers completed their degree program However debt needs to be handled correctly in order to work in borrowers favor Financial success with debt requires borrowers to stay current on those debt payments and not fall behind Falling behind can negatively impact credit which can make it difficult to take out new lines of credit or refinance current lines for better terms Therefore it s important to make debt payments on time and in full However default rates for student loan borrowers have shown that many have trouble making payments Borrowers whose student loans seem to be barriers to financial success may consider looking into federal repayment plan options Income driven repayment plans in particular may be valuable resources for borrowers who can t afford their loan payments Such plans calculate payments relative to income and family size which can potentially reduce payments to as little as zero dollars for certain borrowers and can end in forgiveness after to years in the program Whether or not student debt is considered good debt it s important to keep up with repayment said Knickerbocker IDRs help a lot of people do that especially when income levels are low At Ameritech Financial we help borrowers who may be struggling with their student loan payments apply for IDRs We hope any financial freedom they experience from reduced payments allows them to build wealth or at least improve their whole financial situation About Ameritech Financial Ameritech Financial is a private company located in Rohnert Park California Ameritech Financial has already helped thousands of consumers with financial analysis and student loan document preparation to apply for federal student loan repayment programs offered through the Department of Education Ameritech Financial is a member of the Association for Student Loan Relief AFSLR and each representative on the phone has received the Certified Student Loan Professional certification through the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators IAPDA Ameritech Financial prides itself on its exceptional customer service Contact To learn more about Ameritech Financial please contact Ameritech Financial State Farm Drive Rohnert Park CA customer service ameritechfinancial com Related Links Ameritech Financial home page View original content with multimedia http www prnewswire com news releases ameritech financial encourages financial success suggests idrs for successful student loan repayment html SOURCE Ameritech Financial END",1

A key element of any attempt to ""fix"" the budget is tax reform and, in that regard, the Bowles-Simpson proposal, which raises revenues by lowering rates but expanding the tax base and eliminating tax preferences, has a lot of appeal. Why does this matter to us in the retirement benefits profession Because one of the first tax preferences that will be put on the table in any budget discussion is the one for retirement savings According to EBRI the tax benefit for employment based retirement plans accounts for billion of the total budget for Even nowadays that s real money Just what is this tax benefit The big benefit is this Employers when they set money aside for a tax qualified pension plan e g a k plan or a DB plan get an immediate deduction the money grows tax free in a tax exempt trust and it is not taxed until it is distributed to the employee Why should retirement savings get this special treatment A lot of people think they shouldn t On the left there are those who assert that this tax benefit goes mainly to high margin high paid employees who don t need the favorable treatment and whose savings behavior would not change if it were eliminated On the right there are those who assert that this favorable tax treatment should be provided for all savings not just retirement savings These voices are sure to be heard in any budget based debate about the continuing utility of favorable tax treatment of retirement savings At this point when we re talking about the elimination of favorable tax treatment I think the critique from the left is the more significant one The standard counterargument has been that the current system encourages employers in order to get favorable tax treatment to provide retirement benefits to a broad cross section of employees not just the high paid That argument needs to be made again However those on the left have a point With the decline in DB plans and the prevalence of k plans it s unclear that the low paid really are receiving adequate retirement benefits under the current system Whether automatic enrollment will solve this problem remains to be seen Certainly defenders of the current system will need to produce data showing that the retirement benefits tax expenditure does benefit all employees There s a mildly subtle point here This tax expenditure like any deduction based tax expenditure generally goes to higher margin taxpayers That s a given However if the result is that retirement savings go up for everybody that the tax benefit provides employers an incentive to get everybody in a plan then it s worth it There s another point It has long been recognized that any income tax system is biased against savings Interest is just compensation for the deferral of spending If you tax interest as income which ours and other income tax systems do taxpayers will have an artificial incentive to spend rather than save The retirement savings tax benefit mitigates this effect In the current neo neo Keynesian moment saving versus spending is not favored but in the long run and in real life you need savings As all the ads keep telling us you particularly need retirement savings Of course Keynes famously said In the long run we re all dead What exactly did he know in that in we do not Michael Barry is President of the Plan Advisory Services Group a consulting group that helps financial services corpor ations with the regulatory issues facing their plan sponsor clients He has had years experience in the benefits field in law and consulting firms",1

Post-wedding financial hangovers can last longer than the champagne buzz. They can put home-buying plans on hold, strain relations with in-laws and even torpedo new marriages.    People come to their wedding thinking they have to present their station in life to the world even if they cannot afford it says Lauren Rutten a wedding photographer in South Orange N J Big cars big presents such extravagance is in our mentality now That makes it hard to put things into perspective The cost of the average American wedding and honeymoon is now pegged at to according to various surveys Even industry experts are saying Basta It really is pretty exorbitant when you see how much all the different elements of a wedding can cost says Diane Forden editor in chief of Bridal Guide You have to realize less is more Who needs the limo with the fully stocked bar and the TV Three rules help with the hard work of keeping costs in check Hold down the size of the wedding Rein in its extravagance And rethink traditional expectations That could mean excluding some cousins saying no to the five course meal and ditching extras such as favors You might consider marrying on a day other than Saturday limiting liquor options and calling upon the skills of friends and relatives To start focus on the biggest bills the ones for the party Seriously the cost of the reception site was just overwhelming says Megan Fitzpatrick a year old bride to be from Jersey City N J I really had no idea Many places she checked had a person minimum to book a Saturday reception To compensate she and her fiance kept their bridal party to six people and are having an informal family barbecue for their rehearsal dinner The rehearsal tends to get blown out of proportion and can end up becoming a mini wedding Fitzpatrick says Even with all the rented silverware and linen tent weddings are still usually less expensive than restaurants or banquet halls especially if you can plunk those poles down in a park on a beach or on a relative s well manicured lawn Whether the walls are fabric or sheetrock you will need to decorate And many couples end up shocked by their flower bill You don t need huge elaborate centerpieces on every table says Forden She suggests buying local flowers in season using hand tied bouquets and substituting candles for some centerpieces Brides can also reuse church flowers at the reception but someone has to move them or check out fruit and dried flower arrangements If your guests are artists or gardeners put their talents to use As their gift they could design decorations grow flowers for centerpieces or create banners or invitations Such personal touches make a wedding unique and can deepen your friendship in a way that just receiving a toaster can t As for food look into buffets with servers they reduce the amount of food wasted Offer a wide variety of breads and salads Or ditch the heavy meal altogether If hors d oeuvres reportedly were good enough for Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher they could be good enough for you You can have a wonderful cocktail party great music and dancing serve hors d oeuvres and cake says Forden Keep the cake to two layers and garnish it with real flowers she adds The higher the cake the more expensive and elaborate sugar flowers involve a lot of labor Eileen Monaghan vice president of the nearly member Association of Bridal Consultants says liquor bills can run hundreds of dollars past expectations unless couples are careful Instead of an open bar she suggests a select menu of wine beer and one signature drink Try to avoid those half opened bottles you will pay for every one Brides agonize over their dresses but it s never been easier to save on wedding gowns thanks to the Internet That doesn t mean you have to buy a dress online even though eBay does have a bridal section It means brides today can find out more about prices choices and designers than their mothers ever could So read the bridal magazines check out the Web sites then go to a store After you have tried on gowns and settled on a look you can hunt down and compare discounts from manufacturers stores and Web sites Bridal gowns don t have a season and don t go out of fashion so they don t get marked down on a set schedule says Samantha Critchell fashion writer for The Associated Press Those who want a high end dress should seek out designer trunk sales she says To find them contact a designer for a schedule or call large regional bridal shops We host up to trunk shows a year said Jean Rosamilia manager of Park Ave Bridal in Verona N J Prices range from to and a manufacturer s discount really helps Retailers like J Crew and Ann Taylor also have begun offering summer dresses in the range that are perfect for less formal weddings For elaborate nuptials many brides hire wedding consultants but are they worth their percent to percent fee A bride goes to a florist once a consultant goes to them to times a year Who is going to get the best price asks Monaghan a consultant for over years Our main job is to be rational and stay on budget Brides with less involved weddings could designate a friend instead

Christmas week people are usually off When budgeting don t overestimate the cash gifts you are likely to receive Wedding invoices are actual bills that need to be paid while gifts may or may not arrive And while you get some consumer protection by using credit cards for specific bills interest charges for a whole wedding could eat you alive long after the cake is gone Finally ditch the

Putting off action that will boost your financial well being is not about a shortage of money or having too much debt It s more about a lack of confidence in money matters and not having the right mind set the study found Seven in Americans postpone making financial decisions at least some of the time the study found Perhaps more startling is that more than half of the adults surveyed had not made a big money related decision such as making a large purchase a home opening an investment account or moving money around in a k account in the past three years But what s behind the inaction the I ll get to it another day mentality may surprise you The only thing holding you back is you said Jerry Patterson senior vice president of retirement and income solutions at Principal Financial Group More specifically how your brain is wired or miswired when it comes to money is a major obstacle What makes Principal s research different from other surveys that address retirement savings readiness is that it views investors decision making through the prism of behavioral finance In other words it takes into consideration how emotions psychology and behavioral biases can impede or advance a person s savings goals The study asked respondents questions that explored behavioral finance concepts such as recency effect a bias in which people tend to extrapolate recent events such as a big upward move in stock prices into the future indefinitely It also posed queries related to loss aversion or the idea that losses generally have a much larger psychological impact than gains of the same size People have their reasons for postponing saving for retirement Patterson said Unfortunately some of those reasons are not as valid as they think Some of the circumstances people think are barriers are actually just challenges that can be overcome with the right mind set For example while of the respondents said their current income is the biggest reason they don t pull the trigger on financial decisions Principal s research showed that current finances or lack of money do not play a significant role in procrastination If it s true that lack of income or debt is getting in the way of making decisions then debt levels and income levels should explain who is and who isn t postponing decisions but those factors didn t explain the behavior said Goldstein an expert in decision making and former professor at London Business School who now works as principal researcher at Microsoft Research Indeed even one in four high income households those earning more than per year were part of the group that postponed financial decisions And only about half said they would feel confident planning for their retirement What s more the research noted that it only takes a modest income say for people to begin to feel comfortable enough to make decisions that will affect their long term savings So what then exactly is to blame for the inaction A lack of knowledge and confidence related to investing Patterson said Those who do not feel confident about their finances are two times more likely to postpone making major decisions than those who are confident regardless of income the research found New features such as k s with automatic enrollment or robots that build low cost diversified portfolios for people online have helped investors Boosting your confidence and getting over the intimidation of investing isn t as hard as it sounds Seek help from a financial adviser Seek knowledge on the Internet You can get answers to your questions with one or two clicks of a mouse Patterson said",1

"James Charles explains how to nail down the best deals as lenders keep revising and repricing their mortgages.

BORROWERS are being warned that they can no longer rely on a mortgage broker to provide them with the cheapest home loans.","James Charles explains how to nail down the best deals as lenders keep revising and repricing their mortgages.

BORROWERS are being warned that they can no longer rely on a mortgage broker to provide them with the cheapest home loans. For years homeowners have relied on brokers to find the most affordable mortgages but the dramatic freeze on lending means that many of the best deals are now available only if you approach a bank or building society direct First time buyers and homeowners coming to the end of their existing deals are therefore being urged to explore every possibility in the pursuit of a cheap loan It could still be worth contacting a good mortgage broker especially if your circumstances are out of the ordinary but it also means checking whether you can find a better deal by approaching a lender direct As the mortgage freeze has escalated an increasing number of lenders have decided that they no longer want to deal through brokers Last week Scarborough Building Society axed all of the mortgage products that it sold through intermediaries Other high street names such as Cheltenham Gloucester still deal through brokers but they do not offer them their best rates First Direct Woolwich and the Post Office all offer competitive mortgages that are only available direct HSBC meanwhile made the headlines last week by introducing its Rate Matcher mortgage This allows borrowers coming to the end of a fixed rate deal with another lender to match their old rate for a further two years There are restrictions however Homeowners cannot borrow more than per cent of a property s value and the maximum loan is Pounds The minimum rate that the bank will match is per cent and all deals will be fixed for two years The deal is also available only to borrowers who apply direct to HSBC Analysts say that lenders have been cutting the number of deals available through brokers in an attempt to discourage borrowers In the current climate lenders who offer even vaguely competitive deals are being inundated with applications Dealing directly with the public means that banks and building societies also make more money for themselves Most brokers are paid commission for every deal that they recommend Cut out the broker and the lender keeps that cash There are a number of ways that borrowers can keep on top of what is on offer James Thorpe of HSBC says Customers can find out about the direct only deals on the market by checking newspapers websites and advertisements on television It definitely pays for customers to shop around Some price comparison websites such as Moneysupermarket com and Moneyfacts co uk allow borrowers to check out the whole market before choosing specific deals Most sites will include the criteria for the deals listed which is increasingly important as lenders reserve their best deals for customers who are considered very low risk Louise Cuming of Moneysupermarket says Lenders are cherrypicking borrowers and the best deals that you see advertised are generally only for borrowers who have squeaky clean credit records By using the search engines on price comparison websites borrowers can search for deals available to new customers with similar credit histories incomes or sizes of deposit The result is a list of the deals that are likely to be available to you The best three year fix on Moneysupermarket is per cent with Abbey The arrangement fee is Pounds and the loan is available to those borrowing up to per cent of a property s value Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds The most competitive three year fixed rate deal through London and Country the broker is from Halifax with a rate of per cent and an arrangement fee of Pounds The maximum loan to value LTV ratio is per cent Monthly repayments on a Pounds loan would be Pounds HSBC has a direct only deal with a discounted rate of per cent for two years The monthly repayments would be Pounds The fee is Pounds and the maximum LTV is per cent The best discounted deal from a broker is with Dunfermline Building Society which is offering a rate of per cent with a Pounds fee The maximum LTV is per cent and monthly repayments on the same Pounds loan would be Pounds Despite most of the best deals being those direct from the lenders it may still be worth asking a broker what it can offer Many of the biggest companies do not charge a fee for advice because they are paid commission if you agree a deal so you lose nothing if you walk away Melanie Bien of Savills Private Finance the broker says The cheapest deals might be direct only but there will be strict criteria Brokers can give borrowers tailored advice on the best deals available to them For example increasingly we are getting people who have been turned down by their original lender or who have a missed payment on their credit report which has adversely affected their credit ratings Whether borrowers find deals that suit their requirements through an intermediary or online the message is the same don t hang around John Postlethwaite of Punter Southall an independent financial adviser says Deals that are there one day may not be the next When you find a good deal call the lender straight away and check it is available If it is book an appointment SIMON J POPE CASE STUDY DAN PIRONTI left and his partner Karen Davies have bought a six bedroom house in Clapham South London at auction for Pounds They needed to find a mortgage quickly or risk losing the property so they turned to a broker for help Savills Private Finance found them a Bank of Scotland tracker mortgage with an interest rate of per cent Mr Pironti and Ms Davies will collect the keys less than a month after they first viewed the property Mr Pironti who works as a procurement consultant says We went straight to a broker because in my experience when you need something done quickly it pays to speak to the experts High street lenders do not always advertise all their deals so you need to speak to someone who knows the market The couple had been watching the housing market for the past six months keeping an eye on property and mortgage websites before finding their new home on an auction website It needs a fair bit of work but we are really excited about picking up the keys Mr Pironti says c Times Newspapers Ltd",1

The bigger tax bills will come even if the Chancellor holds off on tax rises in his anticipated Budget which many have said are inevitable to cover the huge levels of public debt created by the state s coronavirus bill Sarah Coles of investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown said most people would end up paying more next year We know the Government will eventually raise taxes in order to claw back some of the money it spent during the pandemic Some of these tax hikes could be announced as early as the Budget in March but even if it holds fire for longer we will pay more tax next year Chancellor Rishi Sunak doesn t need to hike taxes to increase what we pay inflation will do that for him Rising wages will result in larger income tax and National Insurance bills Salaries will rise pc in according to the official forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility Despite this the amount anyone can earn tax free will only rise by a fraction of this just pc to It means someone earning will pay more in income taxes in assuming their wages go up in line with the national average On top of this council taxes will go up Councils can increase levies by up to pc to help fund social care plus an extra for local policing The bill for an average home band D could increase from to next year a jump Those in the highest band band H could end up paying more Going back to the shops following months of lockdowns and restrictions will mean bigger VAT bills too A combination of a fall in spending this year and emergency tax holidays for some sectors hit particularly hard by the crisis means the Treasury s VAT take is expected to fall pc to bn But as the economy starts to recover consumer confidence is expected to shoot up by pc to more than bn The average taxpayer s VAT bill will therefore rise from to a year on year increase according to analysis of OBR figures by Hargreaves All in a earner could end up paying more in even before including other potential tax rises yet to be announced",1
"Households are borrowing more and putting less money into savings, according to Bank of England figures.

This was lower than the amount of money typically deposited pre pandemic which averaged billion per month in the year to February Thomas Pugh an economist at RSM UK said The latest Money and Credit figures suggest that consumers are borrowing more and saving less as they try to maintain their lifestyles in the face of surging inflation Normally a rise in consumer credit is a good indication that consumption is growing strongly because it tends to expand when the economy is good People feel confident enough to borrow and splurge on big ticket items such as cars However this time may be different A rise in consumer borrowing over the next year may suggest that consumers are dealing with high inflation and attempting to maintain their lifestyles by borrowing Indeed we know that retail sales volumes slumped in December so it seems unlikely that the billion increase in consumer credit in December was due to consumers buying more goods Households had been putting larger amounts of cash away earlier on in the pandemic In the year to November the average amount being deposited per month stood at billion",1

"A testamentary trust is a trust established under a Will. The trust does not come into effect until after the death of the person making the Will. One of the advantages of a testamentary trust is that it may protect the assets in the testamentary trust from claims by spouses or partners if the intended beneficiary is involved in a matrimonial property dispute.

However, a testamentary trust is not guaranteed to exclude inherited assets from being included in the matrimonial pool of assets divided between spouses. The decision of Bernard Bernard FamCA provides a reminder of the importance of structuring a testamentary trust in the estate planning phase and sets out the factors that the Family Court will consider when deciding whether the assets of a testamentary trust will form part of the matrimonial pool The facts The husband and his sister both had testamentary trusts established under the Will of their father Both were the trustee of the other s trust Neither was a beneficiary of the other s testamentary trust The wife argued that the assets of the husband s testamentary trust should be included in the matrimonial pool The decision or indirectThe Court decided that the assets of the testamentary trust should not be included in the matrimonial pool because the husband did not have any direct control of the trust The trustee and appointor roles are not the only factors In this case it was fairly clear that the husband did not have any direct control of the trust he was neither a trustee nor the appointor The case also demonstrates that these are not the only relevant factors for a court to consider in determining whether the assets of the trust can be included in the matrimonial pool of assets The court will also look at any evidence that suggests that the beneficiary indirectly controls the trust including requirements for the beneficiary to provide consent before the trustee can make certain decisions the dealings of the trustee and whether they have acted as a mere puppet of the beneficiary i e acting in accordance with the wishes or at the direction of the beneficiary In this case the Court reviewed the conduct of the sister as trustee of the husband s trust including her resolutions relating to distribution of the trust assets and decisions to accumulate income along with the trust s tax returns Having concluded that the husband did not have any direct or indirect control of the trust the Court considered that the husband only had an entitlement to the testamentary trust as a mere discretionary beneficiary On this basis the assets of the trust were not included in the matrimonial pool but the husband s interest as a beneficiary was considered a financial resource although the Court noted that it is difficult to value this resource in circumstances where the husband has no present entitlement Conclusion Testamentary trusts can assist in protecting inherited assets from a matrimonial dispute It is imperative that the testamentary trust is properly drafted in the estate planning phase to ensure that the control of the trust is structured properly balancing the need for protection and the practical circumstances of the client Advisors also need to be aware that the asset protection benefits of a testamentary trust are not achieved simply through the structure of the trustee and appointor the ongoing administration of the trust the way the trustee carries out their role and the records maintained by the trustee are all relevant factors Cooper Grace Ward Lawyers Cooper Grace Ward is a leading Australian law firm based in Brisbane This publication is for information only and is not legal advice You should obtain advice that is specific to your circumstances and not rely on this publication as legal advice If there are any issues you would like us to advise you on arising from this publication please contact Cooper Grace Ward Lawyers Mr Scott Bartlem Cooper Grace Ward Level George Street Brisbane QLD AUSTRALIA Tel Fax E mail communication cgw com au URL www cgw com au Click Here for related articles c Mondaq Ltd Tel http www mondaq com",1

Health Secretary ThÃƒÂ©rÃƒÂ¨se Coffey set a range of measures that the government hopes will address key NHS challenges including patient backlogs. The waiting list for planned care currently stands at mn patients a figure that Coffey claimed had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic The government is proposing changes to the NHS pension scheme in order to boost the health service s capacity We know that people are leaving the workforce for a variety of reasons she said For instance currently pension rules can be a disincentive for clinicians who want to stay in the profession she admitted or to return from retirement and help our national endeavour We will correct those pension rules relating to inflation Coffey continued We will expect NHS trusts to offer pension recycling and we will extend until measures that will allow people to stay or to return to the NHS Former health secretary and current health and social care select committee chair Jeremy Hunt welcomed the government s planned pension rule changes from the backbenches In August Hunt called for an immediate exemption for doctors to public sector pension rules which are currently forcing them to retire in their fifties in alarming numbers Correcting inflation woes The standard pensions annual allowance is However a taper lowers the annual tax free allowance for pension contributions from to as low as for those NHS Pension Scheme members earning an adjusted income of more than and a threshold income of more than Those that surpass the limit however are slapped with tax bills while members also face a lifetime allowance of mn The NHS Business Services Authority has struggled to cope with a surge in retirements which in the three months to April were per cent higher than in the same period over the previous five years according to the Health Service Journal NHS Digital statistics showed that there were retirements in the three months to April The spike in retirements has caused a delay in pension payments In a statement the Department for Health and Social Care announced the introduction of new retirement flexibilities which will include a partial retirement option for staff to draw on their pension and continue building it while working more flexibly allowing retired staff to build more pension if returning to service The government also committed to fix the unintended impacts of inflation so senior clinicians aren t taxed more than is necessary To achieve this it will amend the revaluation date in the NHS Pension Scheme to reduce the risk that NHS staff face annual allowance tax charges as a result of high inflation In August the Policy Exchange think tank called for a reassessment of the link between consumer price inflation and the annual allowance for public sector pensions Previously legislation ensured that only pensions growth above inflation was assessed as the rate of CPI used to revalue benefits in the career average revalued earnings section of the NHS Pension Scheme was the same rate of CPI applied to uplift annual allowance calculations This changed in April however when pension input periods were changed to align annually from April to April These are the periods over which the amount of pension saving under an arrangement is measured The Policy Exchange report argued that the design of the legislation has created two unintended consequences It noted that when CPI rises members are now assessed for their growth in benefits including inflation When CPI falls the annual allowance growth may be negative Negative growth is zeroed and cannot be carried across to other pension schemes within the same tax year or carried back to previous tax years to offset historic tax charges the report stated Pensions recycling carries legal risks In June members of the British Medical Association demanded support for employers to offer the recycling of pension contributions Pension recycling in this setting entails the passing on of unused employers pension contributions to an opted out member of the pension scheme as part of their total reward The government has now responded to this request announcing that by all trusts will be required to offer pensions recycling meaning employer pension contributions can be offered in cash instead of as an addition to pension funds helping retain senior staff who have reached the lifetime allowance for tax free pension saving The NHS Employers website guided in March that pensions recycling may be considered necessary to recognise the fact that staff who have opted out of the scheme due to pension tax issues will not get the full value of benefits from their employer s pension contribution in comparison to other colleagues It warned however of legal risks associated with recycling Employers should weigh up the impact of recycling on pay equality and the gender pay gap it warned especially where recycling is offered to one group of staff and not others Employers could also be accused of using recycling as an incentive for employees to leave the NHS Pension Scheme the guidance added Under the automatic enrolment regulations NHS Employers cautioned employers should not take any action for the sole or main purpose of inducing a worker to give up membership of a relevant scheme without becoming an active member of another relevant scheme The Department for Health and Social Care policy paper on NHS also revealed the government will be implementing permanent retirement flexibilities and extending existing temporary measures to allow our most experienced staff to return to service or stay in service longer In August the government announced new proposals in a consultation which extended an existing suspension on the application of rules around retire and return The rules which ordinarily require suspension and abatement of pensions for returning workers who exceed certain thresholds were originally suspended in March in a bid to make up a potential staff shortage resulting from the Covid pandemic The suspension was due to be lifted in October this year but the government has now proposed an extension meaning the rules would not be reapplied until March In reaction to the government s announcement Hymans Robertson partner Chris Noon said Interventions like this continue to highlight the inappropriateness of the pension taxation system The complications of the annual and lifetime allowances make it difficult for many individuals to save for retirement and ultimately have political consequences like we have seen with NHS staff in recent years he noted adding that Treasury should dust off the review of pension taxation that it came close to implementing in Alex Janiaud

It's a tough question because there are so many unknowable factors: What medical problems will you face? How much will Medicare insurance programs pay? How long will you live? What about long-term care? The bad news is that several recent studies warn that Americans on average should plan on spending well over just in out of pocket medical costs during retirement But the good news or at least better news is that the challenge isn t so overwhelming if you break down the projected expenses into a smaller annual figure In a report released in June the Vanguard Group with help from Mercer Health Benefits projected a typical woman could easily face in out of pocket medical costs starting at age and extending over her remaining estimated lifespan of years The costs are roughly percent less for men partly because they tend not to live as long That projection doesn t include food housing and other routine expenses just medical outlays But the report instead encouraged people to focus on these costs as an annual expense not as a lump sum It estimated that the same hypothetical woman would spend about in annual health expenses in the first year at age rising gradually after that with inflation That s a more reasonable number a lower figure that might encourage more people to view the challenge as achievable That annual figure encompasses most medical expenses retirees would face including Medicare insurance premiums drug costs and other out of pocket outlays But it doesn t include long term care which could run tens of thousands of dollars for some retirees or nothing at all for others At any rate or so sounds a lot better than a couple hundred thousand dollars Multiyear lump sum projections are fairly unusual anyway as people tend to think more in annual costs when making decisions In a similar vein the Vanguard Mercer report explained that single person households in retirement spend about a year on average for food clothing and shelter excluding medical expenses citing numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Yet that same estimate projected over a year retirement stretch and without factoring in inflation would jump to more than Larger lump sum numbers could become behaviorally distracting the report stated meaning people could become so discouraged about saving that much money that they throw in the towel before trying Nevertheless lump sums are the way many studies estimate out of pocket costs for retirees For example the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College recently estimated a typical year old couple would need roughly for health care spending in retirement The Employee Benefit Research Institute assumed a year old couple would need while a Fidelity Investments study projected that a couple starting at age would need around None of those estimates included potential costs for long term care The point of the Vanguard Mercer approach wasn t to minimize the amount of money retireesmight need for medical expenses Rather it was to portray the challenge in smaller more manageable annual chunks Most studies point to a daunting out of pocket healthcare expense over the lifetime of a retiree said Jean Young one of the authors of the study and a senior research associate at Vanguard These large dollar values can be demotivating It s important to recognize that the various cost estimates are broad While the Vanguard Mercer report projected a baseline annual cost for a year old woman likely yearly expenses could vary from as little as to more than Personal health and other factors can push the numbers higher or lower So can factors like changing prices for prescription drugs It s also worth remembering thatfor people who retire early big medical outlays could begin prior to age when Medicare eligibility begins Some early retirees could have access to subsidized medical insurance through work that covers most health costs Alternatively nonworking individuals can obtain private insurance on their own Regardless people who retire before need to have a strategy to bridge their health care coverage between retirement and Medicare according to the study Then there s long term care Planning for these expenses are particularly difficult because while about half of seniors will require paid care others might not need to spend much if anything The Vanguard Mercer report recommends that people consider a range of resources to pay for long term care including personal savings and the equity in their homes Long term care insurance while expensive and difficult to qualify for might be another option So too for certain annuities that feature larger payments for people who need care Medicaid not Medicare is the government program that pays for long term care as a last resort after people have depleted most of their other assets or didn t have much to begin with The Vanguard Mercer study included several other tips for people seeking to grapple with out of pocket medical costs in retirement These include the following Consider Medicare choices carefully as the type of coverage you choose matters a lot Retirees may enroll just in original Medicare or pay extra for additional coverage The report recommended Medicare Advantage a popular private insurance addition as a cost effective option Start using health savings accounts if you re still working These accounts which require enrollment in high deductible health insurance plans allow people currently employed to accumulate money to meet medical costs in retirement In other words workers can pay current medical expenses from regular income while letting money in the accounts grow Contributions are tax deductible the money builds tax deferred and withdrawals come out tax free if used for medical expenses Stay healthy if you can Exercising eating well taking required medications as prescribed and following other smart behaviors also can reduce out of pocket health costs Even factors like marital status and employment can make a difference married people who keep working into retirement age tend to report better health the study said Reach Wiles at russ wiles arizonarepublic com or Russ Wiles Columnist

If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the answers, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not alone. That may go a long way toward explaining why about 19 million young Americans who should qualify for a mortgage donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have one. From racial diversity to stringent lending standards there are myriad factors keeping Millennials from becoming homeowners at the same rate that older generations did Many of these factors are outside their control Experts believe however that a lack of knowledge can be as detrimental to first time homeownership rates as a lack of resources In a recent survey of renters said they believed they would need to put down more than to secure a mortgage In reality the median down payment on a mortgage in was just California Colorado Hawaii Oregon Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Vermont tied for the highest median down payments in the country at People don t consider themselves homeownership candidates when in fact they are says Laurie Goodman co director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute Even in areas of the country where it is much cheaper to buy than to rent people think I can t afford to buy because they don t have the necessary down payment Whereas in fact given where down payments actually are they do It s a huge deterrent What accounts for this misunderstanding For one low down payments are a relatively new phenomenon In just before the housing bubble burst the median down payment was Additionally a home buyer who put down less than often needs to buy private mortgage insurance which protects the lender not the homeowner in the event of default and costs between and of the loan amount each year To be clear all else being equal a higher down payment is better When interest rates are low as they are now it may pencil out to pay for mortgage insurance But the math gets harder to justify if you are taking out a mortgage when rates are high You may be charged a higher interest rate if you put down less than since some lenders view lower equity loans as riskier Starting with more equity gives both you and your lender some security if home values fall But building equity is also a key argument for why it pays to get into homeownership early even if you haven t saved of the median sale price of a home sold in April According to the Federal Reserve s Survey of Consumer Finances the average homeowner s net worth is times the average renter s The earlier you buy the more equity you can build over time You can tap into that equity for in an emergency or in your retirement My parents advice to me was real estate is basically an elevator all you have to do is get on says Justine Boucher a year old homeowner who realized she could buy a home after learning was not a requirement Here are four ways to become a homeowner without a down payment Government backed loans Borrowers with credit scores of or above can put down as little as on a Federal Housing Administration insured loan The upside is that is typically easier to qualify for an FHA loan than a conventional loan with a private lender The downside is that FHA borrowers who put down less than are on the hook for private mortgage insurance typically at a rate of until they refinance or pay off the mortgage With a private loan PMI is automatically cancelled after equity reaches of the purchases price Low down payment conventional loans With home prices climbing since lenders eventually caught on to the fact that high down payment requirements were making it difficult to attract new mortgage customers So around they began offering low down payment loans to borrowers with high credit and earning potential Like the special mortgages that have long been offered to new doctors who typically have substantial student debt and earn relatively modest salaries during residency these loans often don t require private mortgage insurance Credit score and payment size requirements vary and some programs require education for first time buyers You can start your search by reading Low Down Payment Mortgages Including Some With Low Or No Mortgage Insurance or Low Down Payment Mortgages By State Including States With An Option For No Mortgage Insurance Down payment assistance programs Down payment assistance programs which provide grants or loans are more available than ever before There now are more than down payment assistance programs across the country Many help home buyers regardless of their income though requirements vary While there are some national programs most are offered in individual states Urban

Inc., a Mississauga, Ont.-based metals wholesaler, he started an RRSP when he got his first job at age 20 by tucking away $100 a month in mutual funds. He has steadily upped those monthly contributions ever since Nine years ago he decided a spousal RRSP for his wife Joanne now would be a good idea In those days tax law said spouses could not split pension income to reduce the family s income tax bill To him it just made good financial sense for her to have her own income on retirement and to reduce the tax bite at the same time In however the rules on attribution changed Now spouses can indeed split pension income from any source including Registered Investment Funds up to a basis after age That suddenly meant Joanne s RRSP did not provide the couple any tax advantage after normal retirement age But is Hutton upset or disappointed in his decision Not a bit he says It is all about having options says Hutton And Joanne s RRSP gives us an option we had never thought about until this year early retirement Spousal RRSPs are a wise move for anyone considering retiring before age says David Phipps a financial adviser with Assante Wealth Management in Ottawa Before I would recommend spousal RRSPs to all my clients he says The reason was tax savings Now that couples can split income from pensions and RRIFs after age that reason no longer exists But since the only people who can income split before age are those with defined benefit pension plans like teachers for example then anyone who contemplates retiring before age can gain tax advantages through RRSPs Tax savings can be significant when spouses taking early retirement split income says Allison Marshall a financial advisory consultant with RBC Wealth Management Services in Toronto She offers the example of a couple each of whom is younger than where one spouse has a retirement income of a year and the other has none The working spouse s total tax bill would be If each was drawing a year from the proceeds of an RRSP however the total family tax bill would be a tax savings of a year for the couple Despite the change in tax law we still see many couples creating spousal RRSPs she says Early retirement is only one of five reasons couples should consider spousal RRSPs says David Ablett a financial adviser with Investors Group in Winnipeg He says the other four are Windfalls or inheritances Invest inheritances in non registered accounts and the income produced are fully taxable Put some or all in a spousal RRSP and that income and capital appreciation is tax free until converted to a RIF at age Self employed after While the spouse who has reached that age cannot contribute to an RRSP any more if the other partner has yet to hit the working spouse can still contribute to the younger spouse s RRSP and claim the tax credit Double the down payment Rules now allow an individual to take up to tax free from an RRSP to buy a first home as long as the money is paid back within years If both spouses have an RRSP each can withdraw doubling the money available for a down payment to a more reasonable Avoiding income taxes when you die The rules allow an individual to continue making RRSP contributions even if he or she is dead as long as that contribution is within the maximum limit for that year and the RRSP contribution is made within days of the end of the year in which the individual died says Ablett I have seen that done he says When a person dies their executor must file a tax return reporting the income earned between Jan and the date of death If there is money in that individual s bank account and if that person still had room to make an RRSP contribution in the year of death and if they had not yet reached then the executor can make an RRSP contribution in the deceased s name The taxes saved then become part of the estate and can be significant The decision to start a spousal RRSP depends on individual circumstances says RBC s Marshall What you always want to do with any form of investment is adopt the best tax strategies she says You also want to leave options open for the future Hutton says he had never thought of early retirement until this past year But I look around at the economy I look at what my friends are doing and my wife and I started thinking maybe if my boss came to me when I was or so and offered me a package to take early retirement we should seriously consider it Now that she has a topped up spousal RRSP that is a real option for us and will save us a lot of money in taxes every year if we do decide to retire early By The Numbers per cent of men and per cent of women conceal debts from their spouses Capital One per cent of Canadians feel they have enough money to fulfil their retirement dreams RBC dollars is the maximum annual contribution allowed to a tax free savings account which came into effect Jan dollars is the maximum amount Canadian parents can shelter in registered education savings plans RESP",1

PLANNING TO QUIT Family Finance asked Derek Moran head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with George to assess his readiness George has annual take home income composed of salary and dividends from his taxable investments of Mr Moran notes His expenses net of savings are just a year He actually seems addicted to saving but there is tax planning that we can do On retirement George will have a company pension of about a year That s the result of the common retirement plan which multiplies of final income about now by years of service George could split income when he retires with his new wife to take advantage of the new family tax credit though the tax savings for these parents of children under will be modest Her earned income of about a year will exceed his income but not by much He would pay more tax she would pay less When both are retired the children will be over and the tax break will vanish Entering into a union with his spouse to be who is years younger offers a significant tax advantage because he can set the minimum distributions from his RRIF on her age rather than his If he had no spouse his distribution rate would be of RRIF assets Using her age it is about He is effectively cutting the initial payout by about half keeping what is not paid out in the RRIF still growing paying tax on about half the money he would have had to take without the spouse and extending the life of his RRIF Mr Moran notes The minimum distribution rate will climb but her age will provide a discount for decades COSTS AND BENEFITS If George does buy a house with his fianc e he needs to put his name on the title He will then be entitled to share provincial homeowner tax refunds Manitoba currently provides persons over a cash refund of a year on top of as much as a year in property tax credits already available to seniors By marrying he is taking on family obligations She will pay most of the costs of raising her two young children and paying for their educations but she might outlive him and collect his pension benefits for decades George has to weigh the cost of giving up of his pension taking to of that amount instead to provide for his

insurance companies Swapping energy stocks for bonds in low fee mutual funds or ETFs would be worth considering Mr Moran says A allocation to bonds and to equities would be a sensible balance However given that George s income from defined benefit and government pensions is secure he could lower the allocation to bonds When retired George will have his pension and of income from non registered assets generating a year after inflation for total income of a year After average tax he would have a year to spend He will likely continue to add to his TFSA but keep it intact as a rainy day fund which at age would have a balance of with the after inflation growth assumption CPP benefits of at rates at age would push his total annual income to After tax at about he would have a year to spend A year later at he could add annual OAS in dollars but probably lose all of it to the clawback the exact loss dependent on dividends from non registered stocks At his RRSP having grown at a year for years from at retirement to in dollars packaged in a RRIF could begin payments based on his wife s age at about a year making final pre tax income about a year After application of age based tax credits and pension income credits and average tax of he would have about a year to spend Were he to draw a year from his TFSA it could add a year in untaxed income for total disposable income of a year Estimating his future wife s retirement income at age is speculative If she continues to work for years she might add of pre tax job pension income plus full CPP and OAS benefits to family income This case shows what being frugal can do for a retirement Mr Moran says George s spending never rose to match his income As a result he will have a reserve for a long and probably pleasant retirement

Their Middletown home targeted for foreclosure, Bill and Odalys DeBlasio were on the telephone for the umpteenth time with their mortgage company, when they were asked to send over documents that they could have sworn they had already sent. Time was running out All of their efforts to convince the mortgage company to rework their loan visits to nonprofit agencies offers for short sales and mediation had been rejected So you had to wonder Why not simply give up I want to save my home Odalys DeBlasio said We have nowhere else to go her husband Bill said Homeowners who face foreclosure are finding that the lifelines touted by the government and industry are providing little help leaving them in a perpetual state of uncertainty It prompted the Obama administration last week to once again prod mortgage companies to work with distressed homeowners But for now the foreclosure problem remains a weight on the economy And it s causing homeowners to throw up their hands in frustration This large wave of foreclosures is like shoveling sand against the tide Rutgers University economist Joseph J Seneca said People are having difficulty making mortgage payments At the same time prices decline At the same time job losses continue It just feeds on itself The problem stems from homeowners who earlier in the decade were approved for loans that they couldn t afford The loans were so pervasive that once homeowners defaulted it set off a chain of events that eventually sparked a global recession The government intervened It spent billions of taxpayer dollars to prevent banks from failing And it launched several programs that encouraged lenders to modify the mortgages and keep borrowers in their homes The modification programs have made little more than a dent Only percent of seriously delinquent loans nationwide have been modified according to a report released earlier this month by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston And New Jersey has had even less luck The state in January introduced the Mortgage Stabilization Program offering lenders up to to help them modify mortgages as long as the lenders wrote down the loan to the current value So far not a single mortgage has been modified No lender has stated to the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency why they aren t using the program and we would rather not speculate about their reasons said Lisa Ryan a spokeswoman for the agency The answer might be as simple as money Banks need to make a profit in order to stay in business and when they start writing down the value or amount of the mortgage they are taking a hit to the bottom line said James Silkensen co president and co chief executive officer of the New Jersey Bankers Association a trade group The result Millions of homeowners nationwide know how the DeBlasios feel The DeBlasios moved from Florida to Middletown and bought a home in March in a wooded enclave where all of the streets are named after birds Nine months later with their home appraised for they refinanced took cash out and planned to buy a gasoline station in Lakewood It left them with a loan The interest rate started at percent They sent payments of to America s Servicing Co a mortgage servicer owned by Wells Fargo They don t know who owns the loan And the interest rate has since jumped to percent Mortgage servicers collect monthly payments and keep track of homeowner accounts The loans can be bought and sold many times over And as in the case of the DeBlasios it s not always clear where the loan ends up It wasn t long before the DeBlasios financial security was thrown into disarray The gasoline station s owner backed out they said And Bill DeBlasio got sick and eventually was diagnosed with an enlarged heart Quickly they found themselves without enough income to keep up with the always growing mortgage payments They put their home up for sale in late but by then the housing market was beginning to topple And the DeBlasios were stuck A buyer offered to purchase their home for a so called short sale that would require the lender to take less than it is owed They went to loan counselors for as many as five nonprofit agencies that had been tabbed to help homeowners modify their loans They went to a mediator at the Monmouth County Hall of Records Each time they said America s Servicing Co rejected their bid Meanwhile they read about new programs introduced by the Obama administration that were designed to give mortgage companies more incentive to modify their loans Certain they qualified the DeBlasios called and e mailed America s Servicing Co They ve been asked to send and re send documents Still their home is scheduled to be sold at a sheriff s sale for foreclosed properties on Aug We qualify for a modification Bill DeBlasio said Why do I get turned down for that Why are you turning me down for these programs A spokesman for Wells Fargo said in an e mail When working with homeowners who have loans originated by other lenders we must follow the guidelines established by the loan s investors Our goal is to help every struggling homeowner find a monthly payment that is manageable and we have been successful in doing so with more than such modifications this year alone Regrettably we are not able to help everyone The slow pace of mortgage modifications has left some industry officials frustrated Joel Greenberg chief executive officer of Novadebt a Freehold Township credit counselor hosted President George W Bush in March to introduce Hope Now the first government endorsed program that encouraged lenders to work with borrowers Greenberg said the program hasn t been very effective alleviating foreclosures And the number of homeowners in distress has only risen as layoffs have increased and home values have dropped he said Obama s plan came down to the same equation Greenberg said The servicers pretty much voluntarily provide modifications There have not been any programs that force them to do something under certain conditions The outcome even with a voluntary program could come as a surprise Many observers thought lenders would jump at the chance to modify loans instead of wade through the costly foreclosure process But David Petrovich executive director of the Society for the Preservation of Continued Homeownership a nonprofit group in Ocean Township said many mortgage holders have been stalling as long as they can unwilling to settle for a loss And there is little incentive for them to make a concession particularly if they have insurance on their investment The lender will only do what is in its best financial self interest Petrovich said Even though it doesn t make sense to us they know what they are doing The slow pace of mortgage modifications hasn t escaped the Obama administration s notice Officials said they are working with servicers to ramp up their staff improve training and make decisions more efficiently And at a U S Senate Banking hearing last week Assistant Treasury Secretary Herbert M Allison said the government will begin publicly reporting results of the servicing companies modifications on Aug A sheriff s sale has been scheduled for the DeBlasios home six days later For now Odalys DeBlasio works in the bakery department at Whole Foods Bill DeBlasio bought a cleaning franchise and wonders where he can find the money to invest in his fledgling company And they have looked at homes to rent They recently found two When they asked their year old son which one they should choose he said Which one will allow us to stay the longest Odalys DeBlasio said Michael L Diamond or

Many people invest heavily in the latest anti-aging lotions, potions and procedures to ensure they feel and look great as the decades roll by.    But starting in your s this same emphasis should be applied to finances so that by the time the wrinkles of life start appearing job loss health issues college expenses a disaster or early retirement your nest egg won t show wear and tear Donna Jordan Pensacola Certified Financial Planner who is recognized nationally by financial publications offers some suggestions to protect your and your nest egg Although no two people have identical circumstances most of us are able to recognize certain financial stages in our lives she said At each stage there are different financial needs and different strategies to meet those needs IN YOUR S Generally your education and job training will be your primary investments during these years You will be establishing a career and possibly a family But this is also the time to establish the foundation of your financial future You should start with a basic financial plan and a budget by balancing your spending and savings within the boundaries of your income level Expensive debt such as credit cards should be reduced or eliminated Establish reasonable savings goals These should include establishing an emergency reserve equal to three to six months living expenses as well as starting to save for retirement While retirement may seem far in the distance it is important to start saving early Each dollar saved in your s can be worth ten times as much as a dollar saved in your s Make sure to take advantage of company sponsored retirement plans Save a little bit with every paycheck Your goal should be to contribute enough to capture all of the available employer s matching contributions Beyond that if you have additional dollars that can be saved for retirement you should contribute to a Roth per year so long as you meet the income eligibility requirements Be sure to utilize any other employee benefits available to you Health life and disability insurance are generally more affordable when purchased as a part of your employment group Be sure to have at least a basic estate plan to include a will and written medical directives The investments you select for your retirement plan or IRA should be growth oriented and include both domestic and non domestic stocks and bonds All investments carry a risk of one type or another so you must think through your own tolerance for various types of risk Educate yourself Learn the basics but seek professional help as needed with your investments taxes and accounting IN YOUR S S These are generally the prime spending years Mortgage payments child care expenses and other living expenses may seem overwhelming By now you should begin to identify a specific retirement goal that is when you hope to retire how much you will need to live on in retirement and what amount of savings and rate of return on your investments will be necessary for you to achieve your goal You should continue to increase your short term and long term savings Each time you receive a raise a portion of it should be allocated to savings When changing jobs you should never cash out your k It should be rolled over into your new company s plan or into an IRA When saving for college you may wish to consider Section plans for extra tax advantages It is also important to be sure that you have in place a secure risk management safety net in the form of proper insurance that will protect you and your family from loss of life loss of income due to illness or injury property loss due to catastrophe or liability and expenses for healthcare Your estate plan must be kept current For example make sure that beneficiary designations on retirement plans IRAs annuities and life insurance policies are kept current and that any family changes such as divorce death or births are reflected in your plans Investments should continue to be growth oriented and as your investment portfolio grows you will be able to add additional diversification to your holdings IN YOUR S S With middle age comes a shift in your financial focus from spending to saving As you approach retirement each financial decision you make grows in importance Generally by this time children are grown and supporting themselves Most people find themselves in their highest earning years This allows budgets and financial plans to be modified to allocate maximum flow to retirement savings Now is also the time to determine if you are on course to achieving your retirement goal or if you will fall short This is also the time to review your estate plan for tax efficiency and for potential gifting or charitable intent You should also consider the purchase of long term care insurance when appropriate Although growth is still important investment allocations should be modified to reflect a more conservative allocation as you start to acquire investments that will provide income in retirement YOUR RETIREMENT Retirement brings its own set of financial decisions Securing a stable income will become your main objective Primary sources of income are now Social Security employer sponsored retirement plans income from personal savings distributions from IRAs and wages from part time employment Your plan will now focus on how to structure your distributions from retirement plans and other investments to maximize returns and minimize taxes Your budget should be modified to reflect any lifestyle changes including increased travel a relocation to down size or move closer to family and elimination of mortgage debt etc Your investment portfolio should now be structured to maximize income This can be done through the careful selection of income producing securities such as annuities bonds certificates of deposit investment trusts and dividend paying stocks All insurance policies and estate planning vehicles should be reviewed and modified as needed It is never too late or too early to start to plan your financial future",1

A: Internal Revenue Service spokesman Jesse Weller says that wages, commissions, self-employment income and taxable alimony all would qualify you for a Roth contribution. But you definitely cannot count pensions or Social Security. Usually unemployment compensation doesn t count either But it would if it is reported on IRS Form W under the category of taxable wages tips and other compensation This would be the case for example if the unemployment payments were paid by your employer or through your employer s private insurance plan Q Can capital gains from the sale of property be amortized over a period of several years A For most people income is reported and taxed in the year it is received This applies to capital gains says IRS spokesman Weller If you sell property and receive the payments on a multiyear installment plan then yes you can usually spread the capital gains taxes over multiple years On your return for any given year report only the amount of profit you receive in that year For example if you sell property worth and it cost you percent of each payment you receive will be considered a capital gain For more information on the taxation of installment sales see IRS Publication Q I had shares of Kmart common stock that were deemed worthless due to the company s bankruptcy Now I see that Kmart is merging with Sears Does that make my shares worth anything A No The old common stock of Kmart was canceled when the company emerged from bankruptcy protection in May The shares that trade publicly now on Nasdaq were issued by a new entity called Kmart Holding Corp which took over ownership of the Kmart retail operations Unless you bought shares in the new holding corporation you no longer have any stake in Kmart s fortunes If you did buy shares in the holding corporation you have reason to rejoice The stock price has risen from as low as in the early days to more than recently Q I am years old and hope to retire in years I have money invested in a k plan and an individual retirement account and I have enough to cover routine expenses and emergencies I do not own my home I live in a San Francisco apartment with my year old son and have already set up a college savings plan for him I have in spare funds and would be interested in suggestions about how to invest the money A I hate to see you wasting money on rent so I would suggest that you buy a home if you can afford it You can deduct mortgage interest and property taxes on your income tax form and if Bay Area real estate continues to appreciate as it has for many decades you should make a nice profit if you decide to sell However if is all you can spare you might find it impossible to cover the down payment on a decent Bay Area home If homeownership is out of the question then I suggest that you fall back on mutual funds or exchange traded funds that track the Standard Poor s index This is the most sensible stock market investment for someone who doesn t know much about picking stocks The S P has regularly outperformed most professional money managers who think they do know how to pick stocks If history is any guide your investment would have a strong chance of doubling or even tripling by the time you retire",1

The Department for Education said interest rate rises will not bump up the monthly bill meaning it will instead take students longer to fully repay their debt Rates on loans taken out in England and Wales since are calculated using the retail prices index RPI for March The inflation measure published yesterday was up from in March last year For students still at university and graduates now earning or more interest on top of their loan is set at the RPI plus while those earning or less add This means from the new academic year a maximum of in interest will be added to the amount to be repaid Last year the maximum paid back in interest was of that owed The rise will hit students at the same time as the cap on university tuition fees is lifted to a year A Department for Education spokeswoman said Our student funding system is sustainable and fair with affordable loan rates based on income This means no individual will see their repayments rise as a result of interest rates increasing Rates are set each year in September and are not confirmed before then Students at university prior to will have the same rate of the RPI plus But they are instead faced with having their loans sold off by the Government as it seeks to privatise its vast debt pile Under the proposals loans issued before will be sold believed to be worth around billion to the public purse in total ends",1
"When it comes to saving for retirement, many Americans are playing catch-up. If you-or a relative-are among them, here is some good news: The belt-tightening required may not be as painful as you might think, provided you are willing to delay retirement for a few years.

According to a new study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, a 45-year-old with no savings who earns $43,000 a year- the nation's average wage- would have to set aside about 18% of pay annually to maintain his or her current standard of living in retirement. (The math assumes a 4% return on savings.) Such a target isn't much higher than the 12% to 15% annual savings rate many financial advisers recommend for clients in their 20s.","When it comes to saving for retirement, many Americans are playing catch-up.

There is a catch though In order to maintain his or her standard of living in retirement the year old must continue to work until age In contrast a year old who consistently saves per year is likely to be able to afford to retire by age Part of the explanation has to do with Social Security By putting off retirement until age an individual would receive a benefit that is higher than what he or she could claim at age the earliest date of eligibility Postponing retirement also gives k s and other retirement savings accounts additional years to grow And it shortens the amount of time a nest egg must last To make it easier to meet your target savings rate take advantage of any matching contributions your employer offers in a k or other workplace retirement plan And beware of shortcuts In a bid to boost retirement savings some may be inclined to ramp up exposure to equities in the hope of earning a higher return over time But such a move will expose them to greater downside risk without delivering much additional retirement security should stocks fare well According to Boston College a year old who sets aside of his or her pay and earns a rate of return will be able to retire at age a rate of return lowers the age to approximately Email next wsj com",1

Rising debt, lower earnings and a lack of confidence when it comes to dealing with financial matters are putting young women at greater risk of an old age in poverty, a report has claimed. On the week of International Womens Day a study by the Chartered Institute Insurance has highlighted the knock on effects of unfair pay on today s generation which it said could pave way for a significantly worse off later life Across the UK men earned more than women in April according to the Office for National Statistics ONS In October Britain s employers had a gender pay gap in favour of men a gap that s not likely to close until at least Combined this is having an impact on everything from university to debt and even saving for a rainy day I m earning less than my male colleagues for the exact same job Your rights and what you can do about it In the UK student debt almost doubled between and While these figures stand for everyone women are now less likely to repay their debts within the year timeframe due to lower earnings throughout their careers Chartered Institute Insurance said Its report found female teachers social workers and nurses are expected to have between and of debt remaining after years Making pay fairer In some employment sectors it takes women years longer than their male counterparts to repay student debt leaving them less able to save for the future And that s before you factor in loans credit cards and overdraftdebt Total debts across year olds grew by over between and times faster than average debts of the wider population Worryingly the average women aged currently has on plastic through credit and store cards compared to for men To make matters worse three in five professional women who take a career break to have children return to lower skilled or lower paid jobs Your maternity rights More than a million credit card customers to be handed average of compensation who qualifies for cash In turn this means they re significantly less likely to have any disposable income for a savings fund which is vital for their financial security Ironically million more women than men have an ISA account in the UK But the fact is they re saving less The average ISA market value for this group of women is compared to for men How would you cope if you lost your income tomorrow ways to protect yourself for a financial emergency And the same goes for retirement When looking at pension savings men typically amass five times more than women by the age of at versus These figures are particularly concerning given that women have a longer life expectancy than men by almost three years according to ONS figures With all these challenges it is not surprising that women avoid the subject of money Just said they felt confident about managing their assets compared with of males Understanding pensions Jane Portas of the Chartered Institute Insurance said Women continue to have a fundamental lack of financial resilience to the risks they face in life Many of the issues leading to women s exposure to risk are deep rooted in society and will only get worse for the next generation unless we act now We need to find new ways of educating and engaging young women and put policies in place that support them throughout their life As a society we need to improve women s risk protection economic independence and financial resilience improving the financial future for us all",1

have a lot of balls in the air such as a mortgage credit cards childcare and then their retirement There s social pressure on parents to put kids in so many activities spending as much as a year per child but your retirement plan has to come first You need to set up a discipline and a specific amount of money that goes into it regularly Mr Himmelman observes that while there are a lot of digital banking products available there s very little planning to go with them He warns that without a plan the to years it takes to build a retirement can disappear through procrastination or because people are dealing with one crisis after another so they re always playing catch up There s a behavioural psychology to money to investing to discipline Mr Himmelman says Not everyone needs coaching but the majority do need that check in with a professional to affirm that what they re doing is correct Your retirement plan shouldn t just be on a new app that took five seconds to download As much as you can go to Google it can just create more confusion and complications for people It doesn t take long going down the wrong road to set you back years A retirement plan will show what percentage of income must be saved and what duration of time is needed to hit a specific goal explains Mr Himmelman Once a plan is in place parents shouldn t feel guilty about saving for their own future first Everybody always wants to say Oh my kids come first says Mr Himmelman But if you were on a plane they d say be sure you put your oxygen mask on first You re no good to your kids if you re up to your ears in debt by the time they reach university age You ve got to look after yourself first so you can help them later Cherise Berman principal at Bespoke Financial Consulting Inc a fee only planning firm in Toronto points out that it can be cheaper per child once you have more than one Parents will also find their spending shifts with new responsibilities Once you start a family you re going to have competing goals for your money so it really becomes a balancing act Ms Berman says Keep an eye on retirement and start planning even if you re young and can t allocate much at that stage Keep contributing to it Her advice is to take stock of all the resources you have available your income plus the Canada Child Benefit then decide how much to allocate to each goal It s important to focus on all goals and not just the immediate ones Don t leave retirement goals for later She suggests using pre authorized contributions to put the act of saving on autopilot Then you can set it and forget it We see a lot of parents who are providing everything for their children through the various stages and potentially jeopardizing their own retirement says Ms Berman It really is about finding that right balance Saving opportunities along the way include using RESPs to save for your child s postsecondary education Not only are contributions tax deferred explains Ms Berman but you also receive government grants for up to per cent of your contributions up to Always take the free money Ms Berman advises That goes for your retirement savings too Plus if your employer offers a retirement or savings plan where they contribute or will match your contributions take advantage of it Don t leave those dollars on the table Another key is to adjust your own discretionary spending limit vacations and dining out during crunch times when there are extra expenses for children And set limits for the children too Parents need to have a conversation with children about their expectations so they understand how and to what extent you can support them says Ms Berman Don t necessarily provide everything I see a lot of parents covering all the costs for their children education cellphones car insurance Because of that they may not be saving enough for retirement Kids need to know there are limits to what parents can provide and that parents have their own savings goals Older kids should have some skin in the game too whether it s contributing to their education or household expenses She suggests that teens can start earning through summer employment or part time work if they can as well as applying to the hundreds of scholarships available starting with ScholarshipsCanada com Parents can set goals with the children help them to find ways to contribute and to develop a plan to get there Teach the kids to budget too says Ms Berman Sometimes we encourage parents to include their children in reviewing the parents target plan so they see what the expenses really are It s good

   By Kelly Greene 

Reverse mortgages aren't just for people struggling to keep their homes anymore. The loans also can work for well heeled retirees looking for a buffer to keep them from selling investments at the wrong time according to academic researchers And Congress last month gave a boost to the type of reverse mortgage that works best for that purpose Reverse mortgages let homeowners who are at least years old borrow against their home equity The loans don t have to be used for a specific purpose but typically are used for home modifications repairs medical expenses or home care that elderly people might not otherwise be able to afford The loan is due with interest when homeowners move out sell the home die or fail to pay property taxes or homeowner s insurance premiums The homeowner s heirs typically sell the house pay the balance and keep what is left At least households have an outstanding reverse mortgage loan according to the National Reverse Mortgage Lenders Association a Washington industry group In the past many financial planners recommended reverse mortgages for their clients only as a last resort because fees were relatively high as much as of the loan amount That changed a few years ago when a new product was developed by the industry and insured by the Federal Housing Administration called the HECM Saver which typically has lower upfront borrowing costs than earlier types of reverse mortgages HECM stands for home equity conversion mortgage With lower borrowing costs some planners are finding new ways to use reverse mortgages to avoid selling depressed investments or to lower tax bills Retirement is really about cash flow says Martin James a certified public accountant in Mooresville Ind Even for a person who s got their mortgage paid off it s nice to have a line of credit sitting there Earlier this year the HECM program was eyed by federal lawmakers as a financial risk to the FHA and lawmakers considered curtailing the program The bill passed by Congress is intended to give the Department of Housing and Urban Development the leeway to make changes to keep the program going probably after Oct says Peter Bell chief executive of the lenders group Interested in tapping your home as a security blanket A few things to consider Your house could be a reliable credit line If your home equity line of credit gets canceled a reverse mortgage might be a good substitute Three certified financial planners at Texas Tech University in Lubbock and Edinboro University of Pennsylvania published a paper last year in the Journal of Financial Planning that recommends using a reverse mortgage line of credit to meet retirement income needs during a big market drop rather than selling investments A few years ago we were starting to get calls from clients saying Hey my line of credit s been canceled They have plenty of resources but that was an emergency pot of money says John Salter the paper s lead author The researchers used what they called a standby reverse mortgage strategy meaning the reverse mortgage line of credit served as a source of readily available cash when retirees portfolio values dropped below the level where they could meet their goals Using a portfolio worth and a home value of among other assumptions the researchers found that using a reverse mortgage s line of credit significantly improved the chances the portfolio would last through the retiree s lifetime because it reduced the risk of having to sell investments when they had fallen in value Tapping home equity could lower tax bills Some retirees pay off their mortgages with taxable withdrawals from their k or other accounts Yet they might be able to lower their income taxes by using reverse mortgages to pay off their traditional mortgages Mr James says if they have substantial equity That means they wouldn t need to withdraw as much tax deferred retirement savings which are subject to income tax and can bump retirees into higher tax brackets Plus without investment distributions needed to make mortgage payments they might be able to keep their overall incomes under the income threshold at which Social Security retirement benefits are taxed Mr James says Consult an expert Before you start talking to lenders consider getting advice from a reverse mortgage counselor certified by HUD to learn more about the options and mechanics The National Council on Aging and other nonprofit groups sometimes offer such counseling Keep the kids in the loop When Mr James broaches the idea of a reverse mortgage with clients the first thing they do is wrinkle their nose he says One big reason Many parents want to leave their home often their biggest asset to their children as their inheritance Still he contends that many adult children don t really want the house and that they are eager for their parents to use their assets to have a better rest of their life Using a reverse mortgage allows for a little more diversification meaning retirees could leave other investments with potential for better returns to their families Mr James says Email familyvalue wsj com END Dow Jones Newswires August ET GMT",1

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The entire faculty at Episcopal Divinity School has been laid off this summer. The remaining students are transferring to other seminaries. After years the school is putting its campus with its th Century stone chapel up for sale and closing its doors We re going to see a bunch of seminaries close in the next years said Gary Hall the chair of EDS s board of trustees The church is shrinking The need for clergy is shrinking And the institutional support is shrinking Mainline Protestant seminaries are facing an existential crisis after a decade of mounting red ink Enrollment has fallen by nearly over the past decade according to the Association of Theological Schools an accrediting agency Mainline churches where membership has been falling for decades can support fewer full time pastors than in the past Denominations are pulling back their financial support for seminaries while the cost of educating students is still going up As a result some of the oldest and most celebrated seminaries in the country institutions that helped shape both Christianity and higher education in the U S are on the brink of financial collapse Andover Newton Theological School the nation s first graduate school of any kind founded in outside of Boston sold its campus in July and is moving to the Yale Divinity School campus in Connecticut Claremont School of Theology recently said it is hoping to sell its campus and relocate from Southern California to a less expensive area Episcopal Divinity School which pushed the Episcopal church to ordain women and accept gay and lesbian members will affiliate with Union Theological Seminary in New York But the school s faculty and students aren t invited to join Daniel O Aleshire the former executive director of the Association of Theological Schools said seminaries were facing a mergers and acquisitions environment Many smaller schools are joining with larger ones on university campuses which have remained more financially stable Still Mr Aleshire didn t see this as the end times for theological higher education but as an evolution of its mission Theological education is starting to look more like an executive M B A not a degree required for initial practice in ministry he said Until recent years seminaries largely focused on training young college graduates to become full time church pastors Schools like EDS and Andover Newton helped establish a template for what being a church pastor in the U S meant Students spent three years on a seminary campus studying for a master s of divinity the degree many denominations have long required for pastors They studied Greek and Hebrew so they could read some of the earliest Bible texts Such academic rigor gave rise to a class of clergy who were often among the most educated and respected people in their communities But as the nation has grown more secular the role of clergy and seminaries has shifted With dropping church attendance there are fewer full time pastor jobs available In the past years the average age of all pastors in the U S has risen to from according to a study by the Barna Group a research firm specializing in the study of religious beliefs Seminaries have taken steps to attract more students effectively redefining theological graduate education in the process A shrinking portion of students are pursuing the traditional three year master s of divinity Schools are attracting older students who may not plan on a career in church ministry A growing portion of seminary students are taking most classes online Claremont School of Theology which traces its roots to has more than doubled its enrollment since to more than students in large part because most of the school s students now take most of their classes online The school has also embraced an interreligious curriculum and only a quarter of the students are members of the United Methodist Church with which the school is affiliated We take seriously our role in training religious leaders But we also take seriously our role in training leaders for nonprofit organizations and other institutions said the Rev Kah Jin Jeffrey Kuan president of Claremont School of Theology Lisa Devine who graduated from EDS in May is typical of many mainline seminary students these days At she lived in California most of the time she attended EDS She said she doesn t feel called to parish ministry Instead her family plans to start a therapeutic farm I think theological education needs to change and in many ways it already is Ms Devine said No one can take three years out of their life Other Christian denominations are confronting similar challenges For Roman Catholics there is now one priest for every Catholics in the country compared to one priest for every Catholics in More than parishes in the country now lack a full time priest At evangelical Christian seminaries enrollment is down slightly over the past decade though it has rebounded over the past two years Many of the churches that are growing fastest like nondenominational Pentecostal churches don t require a seminary degree for pastors Skye Jethani an evangelical Christian pastor and author said falling seminary attendance is a symptom of a growing consumerism in American Christianity Fewer churches have the expectation that pastors have gone to seminary Mr Jethani said In popular evangelicalism they don t really care about your theology What they care about is are you an entertaining speaker or can you run a complicated business like a megachurch Still some seminaries are growing Albert Mohler president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary a theologically conservative school in Louisville Ky said the school s enrollment had hit record highs in recent years A growing number are taking classes online and a record number are studying to be church pastors In an era when Christianity is becoming less dominant Mr Mohler said young people heading to seminary wanted an unquestionably orthodox theological education A theological seminary that isn t training pastors is just negotiating its way out of business Mr Mohler said There s nothing other

A quarter of a century later nearly million individuals continue to make regular contributions into these contracts which are now worth bn But much has changed in the intervening period How to take care of your personal pension Tom McPhail head of pensions research at Hargreaves Lansdown said In the early days it was all a bit Wild West We had mis selling scandals charges were high and investment performance was too often poor But today the landscape is very different Charges have come right down contracts are now more flexible and investors can choose between a very wide range of investment funds Billy Burrows of Better Retirement agreed If you look back over the past years the truth is there hasn t been much good news on the pensions front But I am much more optimistic about the future he said So as we pass this key milestone there has rarely been a better time to take a look at your pension and make sure you are exploiting this tax shelter to the full Twenty five years ago almost half the workforce almost million employees were in generous workplace pensions paying up to two thirds of their final salary in retirement Today this kind of security has all but disappeared for those working in private industry although it still exists in the public sector Company pensions today are similar to personal pensions your retirement income depends on the amount paid in investment performance and annuity rates in retirement When employers changed the type of pension offered to employees they usually also halved the contributions made into these plans As a result most employees are on target for a pension worth around a third of their salary The responsibility for improving that outlook now rests squarely with the individual who must now save more during his working life or work longer But this has become harder than ever thanks to tumbling annuity rates In they hovered around pc In those days you only had to accumulate a pension of over a working life to buy an income of a year in retirement Building that pot was also slightly easier as tax relief was higher and investment markets more robust Today the same pensioner would need to save nearly three times that amount a total of to fund the same pension Mr Burrows said Some people have done incredibly well from personal pensions But these have largely been the top fifth of the population mainly higher rate taxpayers who have benefited from significant amounts of tax relief and built up very sizeable pots If I have any regrets about personal pensions it is that we failed to make them work for the ordinary consumer paying basic rate tax The scandals caused a breakdown of trust I hope we will have more success in the future That failure has led to two thirds of private sector workers currently saving nothing for their retirement But Mr Burrows pointed out that company and state pensions were not without their own problems The state too has reneged on former promises by not paying women a pension at as previously promised They have also cut back on the state top up pension He said some higher earners may now get less a week than they previously expected A personal pension policyholder who saved a month into an average balanced managed pension fund from to today would have built up a pension pot of which would buy a income for life at given today s annuity rates according to Hargreaves Lansdown Had annuity rates stayed at pc his pension would have been closer to However Legal General s Adrian Boulding warned against judging lower interest and annuity rates in wholly negative terms When we had higher annuity rates we also suffered much higher inflation You got more pension at the point of retirement but its value was quickly eroded by inflation The best investment sector over the past quarter of a century has been Asia Pacific excluding Japan That same monthly premium would today be worth providing an pension Japan has been the worst investment A monthly pension contribution would have grown to just buying a pension of just Want to know more Watch out for the updates in our weekly newsletter Sign up for free Order your Free copy of the Telegraph Guide to Retirement written by Emma Simon order your hardcopy or download it today",1
"As retirement savings have taken a serious hit in the last few years, the cost of long-term care services has continued to rise, causing many Americans to doubt their ability to pay for the services they may need in the future.

Yet, 63 percent do not have confidence in their ability to pay for this care. There s no question that as Baby Boomers age and approach retirement one critical component to their financial plan sometimes overlooked with dire consequences is how to protect retirement savings income choice and independence from the impact of a long term illness or disability according to Malcolm Cheung vice president Prudential Long Term Care Insurance Dealing with the potential for long term care needs requires preparation including proper retirement planning understanding the costs of both long term care services and insurance and the willingness to discuss the available planning options Prudential s study points to a disturbing lack of knowledge regarding the cost and funding sources for long term care services On average respondents estimated the average daily rate for a semi private room in a nursing home at more than double the actual average of And more than one third believe that a combination of private health insurance Medicare and Medicaid will cover any future extended care costs while in reality consumers can expect minimal coverage from all but Medicaid The cost of insurance to cover long term care needs is equally misunderstood While the cost of an individual policy varies significantly by age at time of purchase percent of those surveyed well overestimated the annual cost even for the oldest of individuals The remaining percent were so unsure they couldn t venture a guess Cheung believes these misperceptions about both the role of private insurance and government programs and the actual cost of care and insurance may contribute to a failure to act Despite years of publicly and privately funded efforts to raise consumer awareness about the importance of planning for long term care needs Americans seem to understand almost all forms of insurance better than they do long term care insurance As a result greater education is needed about the actual costs of long term care and realistic funding options The good news is that percent of those surveyed in our study acknowledge they should know more Given that many Americans already feel challenged about saving enough money for retirement the unexpected costs associated with future extended care needs can add to that concern as the cost of care could erode one s nest egg Prudential s research shows that those who currently have long term care insurance are twice as likely to be highly confident about their ability to pay for future extended care services without depleting their personal assets or retirement savings This finding points to the peace of mind achieved by incorporating long term care insurance into a comprehensive retirement plan For more details concerning consumer attitudes knowledge and experience relative to long term care services and insurance see Long Term Care Insurance A Piece of the Retirement Estate Planning Puzzle In addition Prudential offers an interactive consumer cost of care mapping tool on its website designed to provide in depth state specific costs of care to help consumers with their planning needs Comments on this story may be sent to health closeupmedia com",1

The plans, named after a section of the Internal Revenue Code, are attractive because they allow participants to make contributions that both grow and are paid out for educational expenses on a tax-free basis. In his proposal offered during his State of the Union Obama wanted to tax earnings resulting from all new contributions under these plans This would have meant that at the very point when funds are finally being used to pay educational expenses the Tax Man would show up with his hand out So for now the plans will remain intact That s the good news This episode illustrates however the ill informed advice the president received from his staff on this issue The administration s talking points on the attempted tax grab claimed that these plans disproportionately benefit high income households Obama s advisers were apparently relying on the criticisms of plans provided by a Government Accountability Office GAO study completed in using data The Concluding Observations of that report are As currently designed college savings plans benefit a small percentage of U S families In general these families tend to be wealthier than others The president seems to have been advised that the plans benefitted a small group of wealthy families and since the rich are easy political targets why not tax their college savings plans Let s first consider the GAO claim that plans had become a tax dodge for the wealthy The report maintained that a large percentage of families percent who used plans had total annual incomes above in other words the wealthy Using the GAO s own statistics that still leaves over half of the families under solidly middle class a point the GAO seemed to ignore Obama advisors failed to discover recent figures that paint a significantly different picture Strategic Insight a research organization that provides data to the mutual funds industry found that in percent of households with accounts had incomes below many more than the roughly half set out in the GAO report If one uses President Obama s cutoff for the middle class at then nearly three of four families saving for college by using plans are in the middle income category The Obama proposal generated responses from those who really know who benefits from s Betty Lochner who runs the state of Washington s programs says If you re really wealthy you ve got complicated trusts for your kids or you re paying as you go These plans are not plans that are designed for the wealthy they re designed for the middle class President Obama s advisors uncritically embraced the GAO report s impression that s are scantily used In truth by any measure the plans have been extremely popular Even the rather negative GAO points out that assets invested in which totaled billion had risen to billion by an almost nine fold increase in years Today the asset totals are an astonishing billion and the number of families with s has grown from around two million in to seven million Mary Morris chairwoman of the College Savings Foundation sums up the frustration with Obama s now abandoned taxing proposal college savings plans are now helping millions to attend college and reducing the amount of student loan debt students must incur The last thing that students struggling to meet the rising costs of attending college need is higher taxes By making the plans less attractive to Americans investing their own funds in their children s educational futures the Obama proposal would have driven parents into other governmental plans and loan programs This coupled with Obama s advocacy of free community college education would have turned the financing of post secondary education into a largely governmental undertaking Finally an influential member of the president s own party minority House leader Nancy Pelosi reportedly urged the White House to drop the taxing plan One can only wonder how Obama s advisers had failed to consult key Democrats on a change that would affect millions of American families I give President Obama credit for withdrawing his proposal What he eventually learned from the public s reaction is that the plans are popular are beneficial to the middle class and that leaders of his own political party favor their continuation Penalizing middle income families while claiming he wants to help them during his State of the Union would have been the worst demagoguery especially since Obama himself contributed liberally to his own s for his daughters President Obama got the message EDITOR S NOTE Dr John A Sparks is the retired dean of the Calderwood School of Arts Letters Grove City College Grove City Pa and teaches constitutional history and business Law on a part time basis",1

If it wins voter approval next fall, the constitutional amendment would make annual payments for government workers' pensions mandatory and remove it from the annual budget appropriations process.

Donald spent 11 years in university and medical school, financing his education with student loans. Ellen, a management specialist, put in seven years in university.

Owen's real estate agent warned the 28-year-old that she would face stiff competition in the market for entry-level homes - and he wasn't kidding. Owen had to offer for a property listed at to fend off at least nine other bidders for the square foot home in the sought after neighborhood of Wells Branch I definitely spent a lot more than I thought I was going to spend Owen said Similar scenarios are playing out across the United States Low interest rates and an improving job market have created a wave of prospective first time home buyers but they re being stymied by a dearth of available starter homes Nationwide the inventory of homes costing or less fell more than percent between June and June according to the National Association of Realtors The shortage stems from higher labor land and building permit costs that have caused construction companies to focus on higher end homes that bring more profit In addition institutional investors are snapping up affordable homes by the thousands in select markets nationwide and converting them to rentals For a graphic showing the declining number of starter homes for

defined as those priced in the lower third of a local market has fallen by percent according to a Reuters analysis of data compiled by listings firm Trulia The market is even tighter in many cities In

slow to meet the demand from homebuyers As of June housing starts on single family homes were on track to hit this year far below levels of more than a million starts per year during the s and early s That s in part because new home construction remains depressed coming out of the recession when builders retreated and many construction workers found other lines of work The resulting labor shortage continues and is one factor slowing builders along with higher land costs and tight construction financing said National Association of Home Builders economist Rob Dietz Average residential land values are up about percent over the last four years to a level last seen when the housing market peaked in and according to the Lincoln Institute for Land Policy The cost of building a new home

Some of the changes will mean opportunities for those with a plan in place.

The first major American tax overhaul since 1986, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 has arrived. Congress has approved it, and now the bill will be sent to President Trump to be signed into law, expected before Christmas. SEE ALSO Tax Free Income Sources to Supplement Retirement What does the largest overhaul of the tax code in a generation mean to you and how does it affect your planning While this is a highly complex and voluminous law read on for first impressions Changes to the Income Tax Brackets Under the new law the individual tax brackets are set at and What this means for your planning You and your advisers should quickly review what marginal bracket you will be in for vs This may impact the advisability of deferring income or accelerating deductions depending on which year will provide the greatest benefit Personal Exemptions and Standard Deductions The new law eliminates deductions for personal exemptions while increasing standard deductions to for single filers and for married joint filers The following well known itemized deductions are being modified or eliminated The deduction for state and local income sales and property taxes is capped at The deduction for mortgage interest is reduced and only allowable on up to of acquisition indebtedness note that mortgages incurred on or before Dec are grandfathered in and thus still allowed million of acquisition indebtedness The home equity loan interest deduction is repealed Taxpayers will be allowed to deduct medical expenses if they exceed of adjusted gross income instead of for tax years and What this means for your planning Be mindful of how the loss of personal exemptions affect your taxable income For those of you who are used to deducting sizable state and local income taxes work with your advisers to determine if accelerating the payment of state and local property taxes makes sense Those no longer allowed to deduct state income taxes should speak to their advisers about alternative solutions to avoid or mitigate state income taxes If possible you may wish to accelerate medical expenses into and to take advantage of the lower of AGI limitation Charitable Income Tax Deductions The new law increases the charitable contribution limit to of AGI for cash contributions up from now while keeping the limit on contributions of appreciated property at of AGI What this means for your planning If you will no longer itemize you may wish to consider a contribution to a donor advised fund before the end of the year where you can make a charitable contribution and receive an immediate tax benefit Individual Alternative Minimum Tax AMT The AMT exemption is increased to for single filers and for married joint filers The thresholds for the phase out of the AMT exemptions are increased to for single filers and million for married joint filers What this means for your planning Those of you with incentive stock options should consult with your advisers to time the exercise of these options in years they are not subject to AMT due to higher exemptions Estate Tax TCJA does not repeal the estate tax as was proposed in the House version however it doubles the estate gift and GST tax exemption amounts from the original million which has grown to million in and which will be million in due to adjustments for inflation to million which when adjusted for inflation is million in The Unified Exemption which is the gift and estate tax exemption combined meaning if you use the exemption for gifting it will reduce the amount you can use for the estate tax will be million per person It s double that per couple and the surviving spouse may use any unused portion left over from the spouse first to die It also provides for increases to the exemptions based on inflation The exemption sunsets after What this means for your planning With the exemption set this high only a tiny fraction of families will be affected by estate taxes However for those that are affected it is an enormous tax bite at This can easily destroy a closely held business or large family farm and for those affected it will definitely undermine family legacy goals This means planning is still critical for families with large closely held businesses or those that have a net worth significantly greater than the exemption amounts Considering that barring further congressional action the exemption amounts will revert back to million for individuals in So planning now while the gift tax exemption is doubled for the next several years may be crucial Make sure to discuss these matters with your adviser Clients who purchased life insurance to finance the payment of estate and other taxes and expenses should think carefully before canceling or reducing coverage If your estate does not now nor is ever likely to exceed the inflation indexed exemption amount s using the new found exemption amounts to un wind life insurance premium financing and note sale transactions may be attractive Making large gifts to irrevocable life insurance trusts ILITs that have dynastic provisions could also be worth exploring Estate tax planning is still required for those who live in states that have decoupled and instituted their own state estate tax In many cases the state exemption may be significantly lower than the federal amount Business Income Tax Changes Unlike the changes affecting personal income tax most of the changes affecting business income are permanent Corporate Income Taxes The corporate income tax is reduced to down from and corporate alternative minimum tax is repealed What this means for your planning Premiums on corporate owned life insurance should be lower while death benefits received by a corporation from a life insurance policy it owns may be more effective All arrangements involving corporate payment of life insurance premiums should be reviewed See Also Keep More of Your Retirement Savings with Tax Bracket Planning Pass Through Businesses TCJA provides for a deduction on non wage portions of pass through income In short and simply stated if the pass through income for a married couple is or less for single filers then the deduction is limited to of the W wages or in the case of a business that requires capital a non personal service business of W wages plus of the adjusted cost basis of the assets Architects and engineers have been exempted from these limitations Pass through income exceeding the thresholds receives no deduction In practice this means that pass through businesses partnerships LLCs S corporations and sole proprietorships filing a Schedule C will be effectively taxed on only of their pass through income or put another way on only of their normal rate on all business income What this means for your planning Planners and business owners will need to revisit how a client s business should be structured and operated and re evaluate the pros and cons of pass through entities in the light of the law dropping the C Corporation rate to and changing the long standing approach of taxing pass through business income at individual tax rates Numerical comparisons are essential You should talk to your adviser about finding the lowest tax bracket party to pay for needed life insurance and about split dollar life insurance to remove equity out of a business while minimizing current income tax The step up in basis is retained so assets held in your taxable estate at death will receive a new stepped up tax basis This is very valuable especially in the high tax states such as New York California Illinois and Hawaii so make sure you do the math before moving your low basis appreciating assets out of your estates Careful planning and flexible dynasty trusts like the HYCET Trust will be vitally important Other Tax Provisions TCJA contains many other provisions The following is a brief summary of some of them most relevant to most people Full expensing of investments in new depreciable assets made after Sept and before Jan will be permitted There is a per year phase down of the full expensing for property placed in service after Dec and before Jan The limit on section deductions wherein businesses can deduct the full purchase price of qualifying equipment and or software purchased or financed during the tax year is increased to million Deductions for certain fringe benefits such as business entertainment expenses have been limited Net operating loss NOL deductions are limited to of pre NOL taxable income There is an indefinite NOL carryforward but no carryback to prior years for most companies A three year holding period is required for a carried interest to qualify as a long term capital asset The itemized deduction for personal casualty losses would be restricted to losses incurred in a presidentially declared disaster area This sunsets after Tax preparation fees are no longer deductible This sunsets after Except for members of the armed forces moving expenses are no longer deductible This sunsets after Reversing or re characterizing a Roth IRA is no longer permitted The penalty for failing to maintain minimum health care coverage is effectively eliminated starting Jan Plans can be used for K schools and for homeschooling The alimony deduction for the payor ex spouse and the inclusion of alimony in gross income of the recipient ex spouse is repealed for any divorce or separation instrument executed or modified after Dec Conclusion We have just seen the first major tax change since It may be years before the broader ramifications of TCJA are known but it is fairly certain to impact most all Americans Be that as it may much remains to be seen Will the new law result in meaningful higher wages new jobs and business growth Will it help middle or lower income Americans to any meaningful extent Will it dangerously increase the deficit Will it weaken social safety nets What is certain is that in the end whatever is done can be eventually undone when the political climate changes Most of the provisions affecting individual as opposed to corporate taxpayers sunset after and if the other party is in power at that time you can most predictably expect the lower tax provisions not to be extended Accordingly it seems safe to say that none of this is will be permanent as permanent fixes are never permanent so long as future Congresses can make changes This is why executives professionals business owners high income and high net worth individuals and families will always benefit from planning advice and expertise to understand their options See Also The Retiree Tax Quiz

Savers passing down wealth could make a 90pc tax saving and cut inheritance tax bills at the same time using littleknown rules in the pensions system. Funnelling money into a family member s pension is one of the most efficient ways of reducing an estate for IHT purposes and comes with the added boost of income tax relief Pension contributions via a gift from family members attract tax relief at the marginal rate of income tax If the recipient is not a taxpayer contributions still benefit from the basic pc relief A gift of would reduce IHT liability by If the person receiving the money was a higher rate taxpayer they would receive in tax relief to automatically go into the pension and that could be claimed back through a tax return This would result in a pension contribution of and in cash The total tax savings on the gift would be or pc Of course income tax might be paid whenever the pension is finally withdrawn Anyone who pays into a pension receives tax relief meaning that their contributions are effectively topped up by the taxpayer Relief is granted at the saver s marginal or highest rate meaning people who earn more receive more Combined savings on gift made contribution family pension Andrew Tully of Canada Life a pension provider said Making lifetime gifts to family members by way of pension contribu tions is a little known area of flexibility within pensions but from a tax perspective is hugely efficient However there are a few restrictions for those considering making a gift in this way Gifts are generally treated as potentially exempt transfers which means that you can hand over an unlimited value without having to pay inheritance tax but you must live for another seven years after making the transfer Failing that at least part of the gift is added to the value of your estate and will be caught by IHT tax a as a to a member s the person receiving the sum of money must also have enough earnings that year to cover the size of the contributions So if the gift results in a contribution to their pension they must have an income of at least in the same tax year Savers have an annual allowance which means that most people can only pay up to into their pensions each year with tax relief Jessica Beard",1
"For some married couples, keeping separate accounts poses no problems during their working years. But in retirement, it can require some rethinking.

Many couples keep at least some assets separate in retirement, often to preserve assets for children of prior marriages. There can also be a desire to continue the financial independence they've grown accustomed to. But once couples with separate accounts enter the drawing-down stage of their financial lives, rules and sharing agreements that once made sense may no longer apply.","For some married couples, keeping separate accounts poses no problems during their working years. But in retirement, it can require some rethinking.

Many couples keep at least some assets separate in retirement, often to preserve assets for children of prior marriages. There can also be a desire to continue the financial independence they've grown accustomed to. But once couples with separate accounts enter the drawing-down stage of their financial lives, rules and sharing agreements that once made sense may no longer apply. One spouse may have enjoyed much greater investing success than the other One may have lots of disposable income while the other may have to rely on taxable distributions Out of pocket health care costs are likely to increase and be unequal And if spouses don t communicate properly conflicting ideas about spending on travel helping family and leisure activities can create disagreements and other unpleasant issues Tamra Stern a partner at Main Street Research LLC in Sausalito Calif recalls a wife who retired at age and started spending so heavily on travel and other purchases that she had to go back to work for years to avoid being solely reliant on her husband s individual retirement account Of course every couple s situation is different But here are a few categories that couples with separate finances typically need to address Health care Before retiring couples should determine what their Medicare and private health care premiums are going to be Once the premiums and estimates of out of pocket costs are known this should lead to a discussion about how these expenses will be treated Will they be shared household expenses and split equally or should each spouse pay for his or her own medical costs If one spouse appears likely to run out of money due to rising health care expenses in retirement this needs to be addressed Does the other spouse begin to pick up most or all of the joint expenses to keep the couple afloat financially Income sources Couples need to consider how their asset allocations will affect their ability to pay their expenses If one spouse is mostly dependent on a k for income he or she might run down this savings sooner because the distributions are taxable Steve Janachowski chief executive of Brouwer Janachowski a registered investment adviser in Mill Valley Calif offers the real life example of a couple in their s While they were working each earned sufficient income to split their expenses evenly But after retirement the husband became concerned about running out of money While he had saved million in a profit sharing plan that he rolled over into an IRA using that money to pay for his expenses would cost him almost half from a tax perspective His wife was in a far better position since she had recently received an inheritance of million in after tax money in a trust and in an inherited IRA The couple decided to draw down the wife s after tax account to pay for expenses so their IRAs could continue growing tax deferred Social Security benefits can be another tricky area for couples with separate finances to navigate To maximize benefits married couples need to coordinate how and when each spouse should start collecting benefits Strategies can differ depending on their respective ages and means and could have implications for each spouse s ability to pay their share of expenses Thus the options need to be discussed advisers say Gifts to family Once they are no longer earning a paycheck couples may need to reconsider how they are gifting money to children and grandchildren says Keith Moeller a wealth management adviser at Northwestern Mutual in Minneapolis Making separate gifts may not have been a concern during their working years But before retirement a couple should discuss what happens if one spouse can no longer afford to give as much Is the other spouse willing to pick up the slack and should other expense sharing be adjusted as a result Other insurance Separate marital finances may make life and long term care insurance more necessary Mr Moeller says he works with a couple who are years apart in age They were concerned that if the husband needed long term care the wife would be burdened financially and emotionally It might also deplete her personal assets and severely diminish the inheritance she hoped to leave to her children from a previous marriage So the husband decided to buy long term care insurance to help protect her in the event he had an extended need for care Many advisers and clients assume life insurance won t be needed in retirement but it may be necessary to help a surviving spouse pay bills Ideally the couple would have purchased a permanent life policy at a younger age so the cash outlay wouldn t be as steep Mr Moeller says but adds that even in retirement it may be advisable to buy permanent life or term insurance He offers the hypothetical example of a couple splitting the mortgage evenly If the husband s assets are all earmarked for his children from a previous marriage the wife might need the life insurance money to pay her share of the bills once the husband is no longer contributing Mr Moeller calls this the survivor income stress test and says many couples fail to consider how the death of a spouse would affect their ability to pay their share of the expenses Travel patterns With more free time in retirement one spouse might prefer to be frequently on the go while the other is more of a homebody Couples need to consider how they are going to divvy up the expenses as changes occur says Tony D Amico chief executive and senior wealth adviser at Fidato Wealth LLC a registered investment adviser in Strongsville Ohio He recalls a couple where each spouse had children from prior marriages They started retirement by splitting their travel budget But the wife had more grandchildren and they found themselves traveling to visit her family more frequently The solution Mr D Amico says was for her to cover the cost of their airfare and for him to pay their dining out expenses When couples are creative they can often find compromises that suit both spouses Mr D Amico gives another example of a retired couple who had been married for more than years In his working years the husband frequently traveled internationally and he wanted to spend his retirement hunting fishing and camping His wife however had a hankering to travel internationally but didn t have the resources Their resolution He footed the bill for her once a year trip to an international destination He also bought a camper so they could take trips together and do some of the things he enjoyed Ms Munk is a

In his attempt to rewrite history and gloss over his past legislative sins Marquart claims Local Government Aid is not a Minnesota House priority The fact is House Republicans such as Kiel want more of that money sent to communities that truly need it Greater Minnesota communities Last session we proposed that Minneapolis St Paul and Duluth get an LGA reduction not rural Minnesota cities These are three major cities that due to high populations have the needed tax base to support themselves Kiel understands that LGA should be reserved for towns in Greater Minnesota that need the funds for critical services not for major metropolitan cities that want to spend their money on nice to haves like street cars and light rail Along with prioritizing Greater Minnesota s LGA Kiel also voted to use a portion of the state surplus to offset one half of the school construction levy property tax for all Minnesota farmland enact the Property Taxpayers Empowerment Act a measure that empowers voters with the ability to rescind overwhelming property tax increases that out of touch officials incur through runaway spending and cut the state general tax which is a state property tax that all local businesses pay in addition to their local property taxes Marquart believes the best way to help property taxpayers is to spend more of their money on LGA especially in the Twin Cities And about that million LGA increase he and an all Democratic led Legislature approved in The Democrats gave Minneapolis and St Paul disproportionately more than they did rural Minnesota communities and property taxes still jumped in both metro and rural areas In the Metro Area the average property tax increase was percent while in rural Minnesota it was a staggering percent Thanks to lawmakers like Marquart Herald readers in northwestern Minnesota spent more so the Twin Cities could get a bigger piece of the LGA pie and the readers paid higher property taxes to boot Finally let s analyze the initial property tax numbers Remember this projection represents preliminary increases from cities counties school districts and townships The local jurisdictions can and many will reduce their spending plans between now and the final certified levy decision date in late December Last year s preliminary levy increase amount a direct reflection of Marquart s handiwork was more than million statewide and eventually was lowered when the certified levies were decided upon by local governments to be percent statewide Folks be glad Kiel is on your side and working hard for rural Minnesota s property taxpayers And try to ignore the political rhetoric being pushed by Democrats who continually prioritize the Minneapolis property tax agenda The truth simply is not on their side Minnesota State Rep Drazkowski R Mazeppa is chairman of the Minnesota House Property Tax and Local Government Finance Division",1

In a move to target wealthier families, Labour will scrap Conservative plans to raise the inheritance tax threshold to Ã‚Â£1 million by 2021.","JEREMY Corbyn will drag an extra 1.2 million family homes into the grip of inheritance tax if he wins the election, new figures suggested last night.

In a move to target wealthier families, Labour will scrap Conservative plans to raise the inheritance tax threshold to Ã‚Â£1 million by 2021. Instead the party confirmed it would reduce it from to just a move which would slash the amount the middle classes can pass on to their children The policy is not in the Labour manifesto but appears in a separate costings document The per cent inheritance tax rate is charged on the amount of the estate above the threshold meaning that under Labour s plans children inheriting from their parents would face an death tax bill Last night the Conservatives unveiled research showing that an extra million homes could be liable for the tax under Labour The number would more than double from under the Tory plan to almost million by under Mr Corbyn s proposal The Tories say the Labour bombshell will be far more damaging to pensioners than Conservative plans to charge some people more for social care They also claim Labour has secret plans to reduce the level even lower to a claim strongly denied by the party Last night housing minister Gavin Barwell said Millions of families who have worked hard and saved all their lives will see their homes dragged into Jeremy Corbyn s punishing tax The revelation came as The Tories lodged a furious complaint selection of a TV debate audience described by Boris Johnson as the most Left wing ever Labour confirmed it would rely on the SNP to put Mr Corbyn in power in the event of a hung parliament and refused to rule out seeking support from Sinn Fein Theresa May questioned Mr Corbyn s patriotism as she warned a successful Brexit could never be negotiated by a man who doesn t believe in Britain It emerged that Mr Corbyn has backed squatters groups who issued guidance on how to break into buildings Mrs May and Mr Corbyn prepared to field questions from the public in a live Question Time debate tonight The Tories have already increased the inheritance tax threshold from where it stood in when George Osborne s Budget pledged to increase it gradually over the years Under the Conservative policy the level is set to increase to million by Mr Corbyn has gone into the election saying he will reverse Mr Osborne s changes but the policy does not appear in the Labour manifesto instead being relegated to a separate costings document In a list of tax measures the costings document says it would be reversing tax giveaways on capital gains tax inheritance tax bank levy and scrapping the married persons tax allowance to raise billion It was only earlier this week that the party finally confirmed it would return the threshold to The Conservatives research is based on an analysis of million Land Registry residential transactions in It found that an estimated per cent of all homes in England and Wales are valued over By comparison per cent of homes are valued over million Taking inflation into account the Tories estimate that by per cent of homes will be worth more than and per cent more than million It will mean that under Labour s plans for a threshold about million family homes will be caught more than million more than under the Conservatives plans for a million threshold And the Conservatives are arguing that Labour want to go further and reduce the threshold to They say this is because both Mr Corbyn and Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell have previously opposed the rights for couples to be able to pay their inheritance tax allowance on to their spouse on death The Tory analysis finds that if the threshold is reduced to per cent of all homes would currently be hit equivalent to million homes in England and Wales Allowing for house price inflation this would rise to per cent of all homes by equivalent to million homes Mr Barwell said Jeremy Corbyn s manifesto contains a billion black hole and Labour will attempt to fill it using damaging taxes on family homes Corbyn and John McDonnell have made clear they want even more properties to become liable for inheritance tax if they win power Under their chaotic plans one in five homes across the country would be swept up in Labour s family homes tax Labour denied this say it planned only to reverse the threshold to The shock analysis comes a day after the Mail revealed that Mr Corbyn was considering a wealth tax to pay for social care On Wednesday economists said this suggested people would have to pay a French style annual tax on their investments such as property This is on top of Labour s manifesto commitment to hit those earning or more with higher income tax And earlier this week it emerged that council tax bills would treble under Labour plans for a garden tax The small print of Mr Corbyn s manifesto contains proposals to replace council tax and business rates with a Land Value Tax on homes and gardens Last night a Labour spokesman said The only figure for the number of estates that will have no inheritance tax liability as a result of these changes is the one that the Government gave when they first announced this policy in This contrasts with the millions of pensioners whose homes may be under threat as a

THE Courier-Mail's team answers your questions about the Budget.   Answers provided by Tom Seymour a partner in PricewaterhouseCoopers Nicole Bryant director of employment and wealth group of PricewaterhouseCoopers Johanna Lowry taxation specialist with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia How you and your family will benefit Q Family payments I receive child support each month and also family benefit of a fortnight Because I receive the family benefit will I receive the family payment or will my partner get some of this A It would appear that given you are entitled to the family tax benefit you will be entitled to the full But I would wait until the Government issues more information before presuming you will receive the entire amount Q Family tax credit I currently receive fortnightly for three children and I am concerned about this becoming a lump sum payment at the end of the year Please advise if it is to remain fortnightly or to become lump sum A If you currently receive the family tax benefit Part A you will receive a one off payment for each child In addition from July the amount of the FTB will increase if you currently receive it as a fortnightly payment you should be able to continue to do so Q Family payments My husband earns a year and I earn We have two children born in and We missed out on the baby bonus the first time Are we going to miss out on the baby bonus again Also do our family payments increase now and by how much A The current baby bonus eligibility rules will apply to your second child you will need to speak to an accountant to find out if you will be eligible for it in your circumstances I expect that you are currently eligible for family tax benefit Part A If so you will be eligible for a one off bonus per child at the end of this financial year June Q Family tax benefit Can I confirm that eligible parents will receive up to per child under before June Then they will receive an extra per child after we put in our tax return for the financial year So there could be two payments of up to per child between now and say August A What you say is correct though the material about the bonus indicates it applies for each dependent child ie they need not be under However the ages of your children will be relevant in determining how much FTB you receive I don t believe the amount would be reduced to per cent Q FTB I work part time as a scientist and earn while my husband earns as a public servant We have two children at a private high school and one child at a Catholic primary school Will we be eligible for any of these family payments A Your husband will benefit from the changes to marginal tax brackets Without doing the calculations I would say about less tax in and about after that Unfortunately your tax payments will not be reduced In terms of eligibility for the FTB the means tested income threshold has increased You may be eligible for it but unfortunately it would not amount to much Q Maternity allowance I am pregnant with twins due in September To my way of understanding I should receive for each baby Is this payment means tested Also I thought I read that if I go back to work within the financial year and have been paid the Payment A and B when I was on maternity leave that I would not have to pay back that money if I have earned too much in the rest of the year when I return to work A Based on the information released you should receive for each baby and it is not means tested There is a lump sum for people eligible for FTB Part A in which will not apply if your children are born after June Family tax benefit remains and the means tested eligibility thresholds have increased If you go back to work you will not have to repay the FTB Part B Q Self funded retirees Apart from the minor health system tweaks what is there in the Budget for self funded retirees A Unfortunately self funded retirees do not directly benefit from the Budget Q Carers I am retired and I receive a fortnightly sum of with my pension this is to look after my wife Could you tell me the difference between carer payment and carer allowance A I suggest your best option is to contact Centrelink to clarify whether the amount you receive is the carer payment or carer allowance Q Super I see where the threshold for a low income individual to contribute to their own super fund has been lifted and the Government will contribute for each voluntarily contributed by the low income earner but did not see anything about if I contribute say to my wife s super fund What is the rebate for me My wife earns about a year and I earn Will the Government match what I put in and do I get a tax rebate on the contribution to my wife s super A The Budget does not provide much detail to answer your question but there is no indication that the rules regarding contributions to your spouse s fund have changed There is no indication that the Government will make a co contribution But if you earn you will receive a partial co contribution from the Government should you make any contributions to your own fund",1

At a meeting earlier this week, the Public Employee Retirement System announced hundreds of millions of dollars in higher pension costs for the budget cycle, starting next July.

It was a reality check for PERS board chair, James Dalton. It is painful but it is reality We do have an obligation to protect the funded status Dalton said OPB s Learning With Less series has tracked the effects of budget cuts on schools over the last year Today Rob Manning takes a closer look at a key cause of rising costs teacher pensions More than Oregonians get pension payments from PERS Many are retired teachers like John and Cindy Hayden The Haydens live on a quiet cul de sac in Milwaukie with their two dogs after decades teaching in the Scappoose schools John Hayden says the pensions helped them travel to Europe and around the U S Hayden said So I look at our own situation here and all I can say is I don t dare complain about anything I didn t plan it I was just very fortunate Retirement benefits for folks like the Haydens are based primarily on two things how long you worked and what you earned when you left Cindy Hayden says she didn t consider retirement when she was working I mean how many people at or think about retirement You don t she said Cindy Hayden says teachers accepted retirement money to make up for pay raises that often failed to keep up with the rising cost of living She explained And then they come back and they yell at us We shouldn t have done that Well we had a contract At that time we would ve preferred to have had a raise in our salary But we accepted the other as a trade off knowing that it was years down the line perhaps Greg McPherson an employment attorney and a former Democratic state representative said Public pensions are appealing to public officials because they offer the opportunity to borrow McPherson said They can promise something that will have to be paid out over time and they don t have to raise the tax revenue to pay for those today That is an opportunity that is just too tempting to too many of our elected officials And as a result of what they ve done in the past we have a lot of liability we re going to have to pay off because we ve made commitments to our public workers That unfunded liability has grown from billion to billion according to this week s numbers Like many public retirement systems Oregon s PERS system depends on two funding sources investment earnings and contributions from government budgets JimGreen with the Oregon School Boards Association says decades back PERS was not that expensive Green said But when you start adding on things like money match and you allow the board to credit way more than what the earnings of the system should ve been and not put it into reserves then you created a mountain Money match was a system that had school districts and governments matching what employees invested and the market earnings they were getting And pension accounts guaranteed at least percent returns In the boom years in the s return rates hit percent Cindy Hayden said We ve been very fortunate we recognize that Cindy Hayden retired from teaching in when employees could retire on average at percent of their final salary She explained The year that I retired was one of the years where you had a higher percentage Legislators have taken a couple of stabs at reforming PERS The biggest changes affected new employees Workers hired starting in lost the percent guarantee Workers starting in moved into a system much more like a k plan But courts have ruled against attempts to change rules for people who were already in the system Greg McPherson led the reform in By PERS was virtually fully funded McPherson said The reforms would ve been sufficient to stabilize the PERS system over the long pull if the investment markets had remained strong But investment earnings dropped percent in At the same time tax income was down Since then markets and government budgets have been slow to recover workers have continued to retire and the system s unfunded liability has grown to billion There are three main hurdles to changing the system One is legal Beth Ann Darby with the Oregon Education Association the teachers union notes the state Supreme Court has rejected attempts to change rules for current workers and retirees Darby told OPB You know after the court spent a lot of time reaffirming that a promise is a promise and a contract is a contract And to just run new ideas that run afoul of that concept is just creating costly litigation for the state Another problem is political Greg McPherson s leadership on PERS cost him support from a powerful Democratic lobby public employee unions When McPherson ran for Attorney General a few years ago unions backed his opponent John Kroger McPherson is now running for mayor of Lake Oswego He said Several hundred thousand Oregonians have benefits coming to them under the PERS system and to make any changes to those even prospectively is a very heavy lift politically If the legal and political hurdles weren t enough PERS is also extremely complex and changes that seem straightforward simply aren t The OEA says the changes created a radical new plan and before trying anything more the union says the state should watch how the last changes play out But Jim Green with the school boards association worries that without changes to the system or more money retirement costs will cut into the classroom Green explained Classroom sizes will grow because we ve had to lay off teachers Other offerings that school districts have for students and for their parents aregoing to be reduced and we ll do less Some advocates worry that rising PERS costs could have another effect Lawmakers may be reluctant to shell out more for public schools if they suspect the money will go to pensions rather than classrooms Retired teachers Cindy and John Hayden hope legislators won t think that way Hayden said Only people who are going to be hurt are the kids Cindy added No not just the kids It s the kids the teachers it s all the support staff firefighters and their families police and their families It s everybody involved Nearly half of the million in higher PERS cost comes from the K system The bottom line for individual school districts will be clearer in late September when the PERS board receives more detailed information This story originally appeared on Oregon

Our report, Hidden in plain sight, presents the evidence base for the problem and shows the impact of potential policy solutions by national, state and territory governments. The crisis is compounding vulnerabilities among older people often entrenching these existing problems Our research reveals that up to of the newly un or underemployed are aged to This means nearly Australians aged to will have their hours impacted or lose their jobs due to the economic impact of COVID Mature age workers comprise an estimated of job losses and have been hit hard because many industries that are significant employers of these workers are among those most impacted by the recession education and training retail trade accommodation and food services Governments have acted quickly to put in place social protections for the whole population as well as some vulnerable groups but mature age low income people have fallen through the cracks The current policy response provides too few targeted supports that address their needs at the same time as their livelihoods are being threatened risking shunting this group between different forms of disadvantage and increasing reliance on inadequate social security payments There are a few reasons why this group misses out For starters some programs are primarily aimed at Australians aged such as enhancements to the Community Visitors Scheme Queensland s Care Army and an Older Persons Information Line Help for these people is welcome but Australians under also require targeted measures Then there is the short term focus on the relief effort which means longer term problems are not addressed and may even be exacerbated These policies include the temporary nature of the increased rate of unemployment benefit JobSeeker moratoriums on evictions and rent increases and funding boosts to ease pressure on support systems Early access to superannuation may cause later financial strain And there is the use of existing systems and service structures to deliver COVID programs when those structures are often flawed The challenges this group faces makes it particularly vulnerable to the social health and economic impacts of COVID and associated policy responses These issues are strongly intersectional in nature particularly regarding gender Women are more likely to take time out of work or to work part time while caring for children and or other family members As a result women are at disproportionally greater risk of housing and financial stress as they age Refugees and new migrants Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and anyone facing stigma or discrimination due to disability also experience these challenges in particularly significant and complex ways Take the experience of Mary a woman in her s Having spent time out of the workforce caring for her family Mary s employment prospects as a single mature age woman are limited to low paying jobs COVID has left Mary s job in doubt and without her regular income she cannot pay her rent Her lack of superannuation or other assets means she may rely on JobSeeker but if the rate is returned to the pre COVID level she will not be able to make ends meet There is action that governments can take to help low income mature aged Australians like Mary in the aftermath of COVID Our report makes recommendations relating to social security employment supports housing and care Address discrimination experienced by mature age workers through practical reforms including better targeting of education training and upskilling opportunities improving access to careers advice for mature age workers at risk of involuntary retirement or unemployment strengthening policies that promote workplace flexibility inclusive employment and retention practices including government demonstrating leadership through public service employment policies such as the Collaborative Partnership on Mature Age Employment Ensure mainstream employment services are adequately equipped to respond to the distinct needs of mature age workers Continue and expand targeted superannuation schemes to promote greater equity within the system and economic security in retirement Ensure social security benefits remain above subsistence levels Benchmark the liquid asset test for JobSeeker against median incomes Index Commonwealth Rent Assistance CRA payments to movements in national rents to provide immediate relief from housing stress and prevent erosion of the payment Improve security of tenure for renters including by ending no cause evictions and enabling reasonable home modifications to support people to age in their communities Facilitate greater collaboration between Commonwealth state and local governments to grow social housing through a sustained investment plan Expand funding for social financial and healthcare services available to mature age and older people facing housing insecurity and or homelessness as a result of COVID Introduce block funded community care coordination to identify mature age people at risk and help them navigate systems minimise crises facilitate housing security and maintain connections All these will take time so we have identified three short term actions government can provide financial support for utilities public transport medical services and supplies it can deliver targeted communications so mature age people can have clear information about how to get help and it can boost funding to financial counselling to support mature age low income workers to make good decisions Amid the disruption caused by COVID governments can make substantive changes to the way we support low income mature aged people before old policy habits and old policy problems return Mary

Millions could see the amount they get in retirement increase under the triple lock system which Prime Minister Liz Truss has hinted at bringing back. Under the system pensions either rise by per cent in line with average earnings published in September or in line with the Consumer Price Index inflation figure depending on which is highest The state pensions went up by per centin April under the previous double lock system which removed wages from the equation However with triple lock this year it is likely that people s pensions will be linked to inflation which dropped below per centat the start of this month Senior pensions and retirement analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Helen Morrisey spoke to The Sun about the situation She told The Sun Inflation eased this month but it still remains sky high and looks set to stay so for the foreseeable future This means pensioners are in line for a significant pension boost next year as long as the government keeps its pledge to keep the triple lock If the link to Consumer Price Index remains then we could see pensioners on a full new state pension get more than per week She added Last year s per centincrease was no match for soaring inflation and has left many pensioners struggling and so a more generous increase will be welcomed However any such increase will not kick in until April which feels a very long way away right now for those struggling to make ends meet",1
Crypto exec filed will 12 days before his death,"Gerald Cotten, the 30-yearold CEO and sole director of the cryptocurrency exchange QuadrigaCX, filed a will 12 days before his death listing substantial assets, according to court documents.

Cotten, whose sudden death left $190 million in bitcoin and other digital assets locked in his laptop and protected by his passwords, signed his last will and testament on Nov. 27, 2018. He left all his assets to his wife, Jennifer Robertson, and made her the executor to his estate, the documents show.
Nova Scotia Supreme Court Justice Michael Wood granted Quadriga a 30-day stay on Tuesday in a bid to stop any lawsuits from proceeding against the insolvent company. The firm was also granted protection from creditors.  QuadrigaCX lawyer Maurice Chiasson said the orders were necessary to bring stability to a chaotic case punctuated by ""threats, veiled and otherwise"" of legal action.  ""This is an attempt to call a timeout,"" he told the court, adding that the decision by QuadrigaCX's newly appointed directors to shut down the site on Jan. 28 caused a ""fair amount of panic.""  Meanwhile, a spokeswoman with Nova Scotia RC-MP confirmed Tuesday they are assisting with an investigation into QuadrigaCX. Cpl. Jennifer Clarke said the investigation is being led by the RCMP's Toronto West detachment.  The exchange, launched in December 2013, allowed users to deposit cash or cryptocurrency with Quadriga through its online trading platform, storing the digital coins on blockchain ledgers that are accessible only by an immutable alphanumeric code. The company had 363,000 registered users, of which 92,000 have account balances owing to them, according to court filings.  His wife filed an affidavit with Nova Scotia Supreme Court saying Cotten was the only person with access to the laptop. She said she has searched their home in Fall River, N.S., where he conducted most of his business, and was unable to find any passwords or business records.  Cotten died Dec. 9 of complications due to Crohn's disease in Jaipur, India, according to Robertson's affidavit and a statement of death from J.A. Snow Funeral Home in Halifax, dated Dec. 12. The couple didn't have any children.  The exchange founder's will outlines numerous assets he held, including several properties in Kelowna, B.C. and Nova Scotia, a 2017 Lexus, an airplane, a Jeanneau 51 yacht and his pet chihuahuas, Nitro and Gully. He also left his frequent flyer points and reward points to Robertson. He held accounts with Bank of Montreal and Canadian Tire.  The firm can't retrieve about $190 million in Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether and other digital tokens held for its customers, nor can Vancouver-based QuadrigaCX pay the $70 million in cash those clients are owed.

"I'm a Conservative Investor, and Other Lies We Tell Ourselves","No investment is completely safe. You need to understand the risks in your portfolio.

I often meet with prospective clients shortly before they plan to retire and ask them about their current financial situation and goals. During this first meeting, many say, ""I'm a conservative investor."" But the amount of risk in their investment portfolios sometimes tells a completely different story.
SEE ALSO: 7 Worst Mistakes Investors Will Make in This Market  One common misconception of being ""conservative"" is having a large percentage of the portfolio in a stock that has performed well in the past. Even if a particular stock has performed well in the past, it is never a guarantee of future results. All stocks are subject to a significant amount of risk, including loss of principal. Risks for individual stocks include overall market risk, industry-specific risk, company-specific risk, new technology, new competitors and new regulations--all of which can adversely affect the business model. In fact, the average individual stock within Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has a volatility that is about twice that of the index itself.  Another misunderstanding is categorizing stocks paying large dividends as a conservative investment. Remember that dividends are discretionary and can be reduced or canceled without warning. A company having difficulty may cut the dividend as one of their first relief points. When this happens, people who bought the stock primarily for the high dividend may sell, impacting the underlying stock price.  I have also met with prospective clients who own investments with high current incomes. Though these types of investments may provide a bit of outperformance some of the time, every once in a while they get hit really hard. During the 2008 crisis, many preferred stocks were negatively affected at higher rates than the stock market. Although they may appear conservative since they may go a period of time producing outsized yields, remember that just because they have not been hit yet, does not mean they cannot get hit.  We cannot talk about conservative investing without mentioning fixed income investments such as bonds. The caution here is to understand the credit rating and the associated risk. A promise to pay is only as good as the party making the promise. People tend to underestimate the credit risk of a large company, assuming big equals safe. Additionally, brand recognition can create less perceived risk, regardless of the lower credit quality. Remember that bonds are subject to market interest rate risk if sold prior to maturity. Bond values will decline as interest rates rise and bonds are subject to availability and change in price.  Be aware of your risk exposure. A good way to think about an investment is to consider whether it acts more equity-like or more bond-like in its volatility and take the level of risk into account relative to the answer. There is no magic investment. When you see a company paying 6% while their peers are paying 1% or 2%, understand that they are not paying more without good reason.  I am not saying to never invest in the type of investments mentioned above. One or more may be suitable for your investment portfolio, but that is something your financial adviser can help you to determine based on your investment objectives. Just keep in mind that no investment strategy can guarantee a profit or protect against loss in periods of declining values.  The Risk of Being Too Conservative  In contrast to the ""conservative"" investors with risky investments in their portfolios, there are also investors on the other end of the spectrum who are so concerned about losing their money that they are too conservative for their financial situation. These investors come to us with conservative investments such as treasuries, short-term certificates of deposit and money market accounts. After talking about their withdrawal need, they are often surprised at the possible outcome.  Consider a 65-year-old couple with $1 million, withdrawing 5% per year. If interest rates stay where they are today, they will run out of money in less than 25 years. If we experience inflation, or if they need to give themselves a raise, they could run out of money in less than 20 years, by age 85. According to the Social Security Administration, about one out of every four 65-year-olds will live past the age of 90 and one out of 10 will live past the age of 95.  It is important to understand how historically low interest rates have made finding investments that produce sufficient income difficult. It is very different from 10 years ago when an investor could just park a million dollars in a money market account and collect $50,000 a year of interest without having to touch the principal. A conservative investor needs to adjust to this new environment, which could persist for quite a while.  In investing, so much is beyond the scope of your control, making it even more important to control the things that you can control. This can include where you own your investments, where you draw from and cutting back on expenses where possible. If you have not already, you should establish a disciplined approach to making adjustments to your investments in order to maintain your risk profile. Whether you are a do-it-yourselfer or have been working with a financial adviser for quite some time, you may also want to consider an independent review by someone who can objectively look at your portfolio.

We all experience inflation differently Your own CPI is probably different from announced figure  ,"How do you stay ahead of inflation when it's so hard to gauge?  

The Bureau of Labor Statistics set the raw inflation rate for the month of April: 0.9 percent. After seasonal adjustment, it was still a fiery 0.6 percent. The trailing 12-month rate was 3.5 percent.  
This pronouncement came weeks after the Treasury dropped the interest rate on I Savings Bonds to 2.41 percent from 6.73 percent, citing an incredibly low inflation rate for the preceding six months - a mere 1 percent a year.    So is annual inflation at 3.5 percent or 1 percent?    The discrepancies are painful for I Savings Bond owners and are largely a matter of timing, as explained in a recent column.    But distrust of the consumer price index runs deep. Everyone wants to know what the ""real"" inflation rate is. Most think it is substantially higher than the published figure.    As a practical matter, each of us experiences inflation differently.    Why? We spend our money differently.    Your personal CPI is likely to be very different from the announced CPI. Here are some examples.    The elderly    Retirees complain the most. They look at their medical bills, look at the announced inflation rate and wonder whether Washington has moved to Mars.    Part of the problem is that medical care has a weight of only 6.2 percent in the CPI-U, the most commonly used inflation index for urban dwellers.    Seniors spend a lot more than 6.2 percent of their income on medical care. Surveys indicate they spend about 20 percent. So they are more than three times as vulnerable to health care inflation.    Even the experimental CPI for the elderly, dubbed CPI-E, carries a medical care weight of 10.2 percent. The experimental index shows that the rate of inflation for seniors is higher than the rate of inflation for urban workers.    A research study at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2003, for instance, found that between 1984 and 2001, the conventional index understated the inflation seniors experienced by 3.84 percent.    Had the experimental index been used for benefits, the study found, Social Security retirement benefits would have been an average $408 a year higher.    The OASDI Trust fund, the researchers noted, would also be insolvent 5 years earlier.    Debtors    Debt is good insulation from inflation.    If a third of your income is committed to a fixed payment home mortgage and a fixed payment car loan - a condition that describes millions of households in their 30s and 40s - then you only need a 2 percent increase in income to cope with a 3 percent rate of inflation.    Debtors with variable rate, interest-only first mortgages and home equity lines of credit are at the other end of the spectrum.    Over the last two years their debt service costs have been rising like prices in a banana republic.    Those with no debt, on the other hand, are fully exposed to whatever the general inflation rate is.    Housing's impact    Shelter has always loomed large in the consumer price index. It currently accounts for 32.3 percent of the index.    It has always been problematic. In the late '70s, for instance, the largest single lever in the CPI was the interest rate on home mortgages. To stabilize the index, mortgage interest rates were eliminated, as were housing prices.    A new measure was created, an ""owners' equivalent rent"" index.    The change eliminated some problems and created new ones.    The elimination of home prices worked to reduce the rate of inflation.    The decline in home mortgage rates made homeownership so easy for so many that rents actually declined as renters became homeowners. Until late last summer, apartment-owning REITs were reporting lower average rents due to concessions. The combination worked to keep reported inflation rates low.    Now higher interest rates are slowing home purchases, rental vacancies are declining, and rents are rising. Shelter may now start to fatten the CPI rather than slim it.    Whatever the ""real"" rate of inflation is, we can safely assume one thing: The direction is up, not down.    Scott Burns answers questions of general interest in his Thursday columns.

TRAPPED IN DEBT CITY.  ,"INVESTIGATES THE ESTATE WHERE POOR FAMILIES PAY Â£1M A YEAR TO LOAN SHARKS  

THIS is Britain's most in-debt estate where residents are struggling to repay Â£1MILLION A YEAR to ruthless loan sharks.  
The unscrupulous doorstep lenders exploit poor families by charging interest rates as high as 244 PER CENT.    They use every cynical trick on the Preston Road estate in Hull, East Yorks, where nearly a third are on the dole and the rest earn as little as Â£100 a week in lousy jobs.    The lenders - who are licensed by the Government and are perfectly legal:    LURE residents at Christmas with gift vouchers, food hampers and TV sets, knowing most are too poor to buy presents or own a telly.    HIDE shocking interest rates which push the cost of a Â£400 TV to Â£1,000 and a Â£50 book of shopping vouchers to Â£125.    PUSH blank cheques through the letterbox before school terms, knowing single mums need to buy food and clothes for their kids but are too poor to qualify for a bank loan.    HARASS borrowers when they miss repayments.    Financial expert Karen Wood, who is trying to sort out the estate's loan nightmare, said: ""Residents are trapped in a vicious circle of unbelievable debt.    ""Some can't afford to pay for their weekly shop or buy their child new shoes. And with interest rates as high as 244 per cent there is no way they can keep on top of repayments.    ""They end up borrowing from one lender just to repay another and then another.    ""The loan sharks are licensed but the tactics they employ are unreasonable, cynical and exploitative.""    The rundown estate - which has Britain's highest number of schoolgirl mums with 220 getting pregnant last year - provides rich pickings for five lenders.    A third of the 6,000 residents - whose MP is Deputy Premier John Prescott - are repaying around Â£20,000 a week. That's a staggering Â£1million a year.    The lenders descend on the estate three times a week. Karen, who works for a charity, said: ""At Christmas they drove up with televisions in the back of their expensive cars.    ""They persuaded residents to buy a TV for Â£7 a week. But over three years. that works out at Â£1,000 for a set that costs Â£400 on the high street.""    Karen added: ""Some even offer blank cheques."" But a Â£300 loan costs Â£500 to repay.    If residents were able to borrow Â£5,000 from the Co-op Bank they would pay it back at an annual percentage rate of just 5.9 per cent. Sainsbury's fee is 6.2 per cent.    Most residents are so desperate for money they don't even ask about the sharks' interest rates. And the lenders emphasise cheap weekly payments rather than the overall cost of the agreement.    When customers are unable to repay, the debt collectors harass them.    Some stand outside the post office while residents collect benefits. One resident complained to Karen's charity about collectors who knocked on her ill dad's door because she'd missed a Â£15 payment.    The Government has announced plans for a clampdown on money lenders who charge rip-off rates. A spokesman said: ""We are committed to stamping out loan sharking and helping deprived areas.""    But for the anguished residents of Preston Road estate, it's too late.    National Debt Line number is 0808 808 4000.EMMA FACES EVICTION    EMMA Parson, 22, and her one-year-old baby could be evicted from their home next week because all her money has been going to loan sharks.    The single mum owes Â£500 to two lenders and Â£1,000 in rent. But she can't afford the repayments on her meagre salary as a bakery assistant.    Emma explained: ""I only earn Â£100 a week and I pay back Â£35 a week to lenders.    ""I've still got to feed and clothe my baby, pay the bills and my Â£150 a month rent. I just can't afford it.    ""I only took out the loans six months ago and I'm deep in debt. It was my mum who introduced me to the moneylenders.    ""That's how she's always borrowed money and now I'm doing the same.    ""On my first loan of Â£300 I'm paying Â£200 interest and on my second for Â£200 I'm paying Â£150.""    Karen Wood is trying to help Emma by organising a loan from the charity, the Preston Road Neighbourhood Development Company.    If that doesn't go through in time, Emma will have to move in with her mother in the next street.    I OWE THREE LENDERS MONEY    JOBLESS single mum Beverley Deters is in debt to three lenders.    Her troubles started when she bought a book of shopping vouchers.    Beverley, 30, who lives on Â£100 a week benefits, said: ""It was just before Christmas so I bought a book for Â£50 which contains vouchers for stores such as Argos and Boots.    ""A man knocked on my door and just handed them to me. I was on benefits and completely broke.    ""They said I'd only have to pay Â£5 a week and that sounded reasonable. I eventually paid back Â£125.""    Beverley still owes Â£300 to collectors and is paying off Â£25 a week. She said: ""People must think we're mad taking out lots of loans when we can't afford to pay one. But when you're desperate you'll do anything to feed and clothe your child.""    Beverley told how intimidating it can be when the lenders call round to demand repayments.    She added: ""My heart stops every time the doorbell goes because I'm worried it's a debt collector.    ""They don't give up and if you're not in one day they just keep coming round until you give them the money.    ""When I see the female debt collectors, it makes my blood boil.    ""Many are mums and they must see how hard it is to scrape together the repayments just to give my kids a pair of trainers.""

Debt burden hits record,"Your Money

THE number of Britons facing a debt crisis has soared to an all-time high, a report has revealed.
Citizens Advice Bureaux dealt with a record 1.7million inquiries from people needing help with money worries in the past year â€” a rise of a fifth on the previous 12 months.  A worrying trend has been an increase in those finding it difficult to meet everyday expenses.  Advisers have seen a 33 per cent jump in the number of people unable to afford gas or electricity.  Problems with council tax arrears surged 25 per cent and phone bills by 19 per cent.  However, perhaps of most concern is an 11 per cent rise in cases of homeowners who are not able to keep up with their mortgage repayments.  Five interest-rate hikes since last August have meant many families are struggling to make ends meet.  David Harker, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""These figures are worrying evidence that while many may have enjoyed the benefits of the credit boom, a large and growing number of people continue to pay the price, becoming overwhelmed by serious debt that can have a devastating impact on their lives.""

One in 25 people set to inherit more than a million,"One in 50 expect to receive over Â£5m, research by Canada Life reveals

Without an inheritance strategy, tax on a Â£1m estate amounts to Â£230,000, however only one in 20 know about the residence nil rate band tapering for estates over Â£2m, according to Canada Life's annual IHT monitor.
Of the consumers questioned (aged 45 and over), 24% expect an inheritance of Â£250,000, while 15% are looking to receive Â£500,000.  The figures reflect rising UK wealth in recent decades, however without financial planning individuals can expect to be hit with 40% IHT for assets above the nil rate band threshold.  However a professional adviser can help plan a wealthy individual's finances - which could include a life assurance trust - to fall below the IHT threshold.  ""People's expectations are likely to be substantially wrong without financial planning, and it's quite likely they could lose substantial amounts of money in tax. Yet it's quite possible to ensure that, by using a straightforward trust, the entire amount goes where it is intended - the beneficiaries.  ""For people expecting around Â£500,000 or more in inheritance, there is still a danger of losing tens of thousands of pounds in tax. It's very much worth their while talking to a professional adviser or planner to make sure there's a sound financial plan at work. The risk of a big IHT bill drops to zero at the inheritance tax threshold of Â£325,000, below which there is no tax.""

New crisis for Flint residents: Cost of home damage caused by city water,"If a lead-laced water supply wasn't enough to deal with, many residents of Flint, Mich., face a new crisis: Replacing the water heaters, pipes and even the service lines to their homes that may have been damaged by the city's water.

And for now, it's unclear whether they will receive any help in covering those costs.
""I hope and pray they start releasing some money,"" said homeowner Arthur Woodson, a disabled veteran who lives in a house like many in Flint: built with lead plumbing that, until the city switched to a new water source in 2014, was considered safe.  For residents who already fear their health has been compromised by the water, the emerging related costs are adding to the anxiety, especially considering Flint, a city of 100,000, is among the poorest of its size in the country. The city has for years been dealing with unemployment rates that exceed the national average. With the water crisis now filling daily headlines, many in Flint say banks are refusing to offer refinancing that could free up money to pay for the retrofitting, and that the costs are not covered by insurance.  The crisis has created a perfect storm to strip their houses of their remaining value, they say.  ""People feel absolutely trapped,"" said Melissa Mays, a homeowner and activist. ""We feel like prisoners in our own homes. We're being poisoned by the very homes we live in.""  The crisis first became known in April 2014, when the city switched its water supply to the Flint River as a temporary measure before a pipeline was built to another source. The change was intended to save money. But soon, residents complained of foul-smelling, odd-colored water.  The Flint River water's high chloride content wasn't treated as required, a state task force has reported, and is thought to have weakened the city's aging water distribution system, which contains a high percentage of lead pipes and plumbing. That is believed to have sent high volumes of lead into the city's drinking water.  That corrosive Flint River water also is thought to have similarly damaged the pipes and appliances in homes throughout Flint.  Homeowners could shoulder a burden of $4,000 or more to cover the costs of a new water heater, a new plumbing system featuring PVC piping that is not susceptible to corrosion, and a new service line connection, which is the most costly component because it involves excavation and piping that can extend up to 30 feet from the house to the street, according to Marc Edwards, a national expert on municipal water quality at Virginia Tech.  Edwards has been leading a team of researchers in conducting water tests in Flint, and estimates that correcting the damage caused from corrosion to the water system will cost between $20 million and $200 million. The city says the replacement cost for an entirely new system could be $1.5 billion.  Some residents, including Mays, have already gone through more than one water heater since the crisis began. There is also the worry that new appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, are vulnerable to corrosion from the water and will need to be replaced.  Sergio Kapusta, a fellow at NACE International, an industry organization that develops corrosion prevention and control standards in Houston, says that ""changing all the mains in the city will not really solve the problem for the homeowners"" because the lead piping in these homes probably has been severely compromised. ""The corrosion is not going away. It's still there,"" he says.  Before homeowners do anything, they need to wait for the city either to correct sections of its system that are corroded or to replace the system.  ""If you just replace your section, you're still getting all the garbage from the city,"" he said.  Kapusta, who teaches material science at Rice University, says that in the meantime the only option for a homeowner is to install a water purification system for basic needs and to drink bottled water.  ""There is not a cheap and easy solution, but it's all you can do until the city replaces the pipes,"" he said.  This week, President Obama pledged $80 million in federal money to help in the recovery, and the Michigan House approved $28 million in emergency funding for Flint. The state budget director will open hearings on the budget Feb. 10, but it is not certain how much money, if any, will be allotted to help defray homeowner costs. Anna Heaton, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Snyder (R), would not offer specifics. She said that Snyder ""is considering every available resource to help with infrastructure replacement"" and added that ""plans are preliminary, but they are certainly in progress.""  While Flint residents wait, they also face an increased number of shut-off notices due to unpaid bills. In August, Genesee Circuit Judge Archie Hayman issued an emergency injunction to stop them, but last week finance director Jody Lundquist said the city will begin issuing water shut-off notices soon. Kristin Moore, a city spokeswoman, said Flint has a legal obligation to bill for utility services, but that the state of emergency declared by Snyder is forcing the city to review its policy on shut-off notices. None have been issued since December.  The shut offs have raised the ire of some state lawmakers. Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette announced an immediate investigation into the crisis, which will include looking at possible violations at the local level.  ""If you can't drink the water, you shouldn't be billed for it. That's nuts and must be fixed,"" he wrote on Twitter this week.  State Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich (D) said that a lack of a plan to address the mounting costs affecting residents adds to the crisis. He suggests the city needs to provide a credit for residents who have been paying for water during the time that it was known to be toxic, and that there should be a moratorium on shut-off notices ""until there is a system-wide certainty the water is safe.""  ""Pretending to go after money that will never be collected is a massive waste of time and also a massive waste of money,"" he said. ""You are going after people who did nothing wrong.""  Two class-action lawsuits were filed by Flint residents last week against Snyder and other state officials demanding that the city end water shut offs and that the court declare that residents should not be required to pay past or future water bills for undrinkable water. One lawsuit accuses the state of destroying property values.  national@washpost.com",1
"Did the budget fill you with horror, or were you cheering George Osborne on?","Guardian writers asked people across the country â€“ from a family in north Yorkshire to a convenience-store owner in Norfolk â€“ for their views

Nicola Marshall
Kent-based Nicola Marshall, like other benefit claimants, will be subject to a four-year-long benefit freeze under a clampdown announced in the chancellorâ€™s budget. Money is a struggle, the 37-year-old admits â€“ she says she and her 11-year-old daughter Lily-May barely get by.  I have always worked and Iâ€™ve been given pay rises, but Iâ€™m no better off  Nicola Marshall  Marshall works 21 hours a week for a company that manufactures showers, and campaigns for Gingerbread, the single parent charity. She receives Â£107 a week from working tax credit and child benefit. She also gets fortnightly housing benefit of Â£200.  She recently got a Â£100-a-month pay rise but says this has been entirely wiped out by an equivalent recent reduction in her benefits. The freeze on her benefits comes as a further blow.  â€œWhat I find really frustrating is I have always worked and Iâ€™ve been given pay rises, but Iâ€™m no better off because if you earn more money the benefits get taken away from you,â€ she says. â€œFreezing benefits is effectively a further cut and is going to be very stressful.â€  She says that life has already become a lot more expensive after she had to fork out hundreds of pounds for Lily-Mayâ€™s secondary school uniform.  â€œI am hoping at some point Iâ€™ll start earning enough not to worry about money,â€ she adds. â€œThere is a light at the end of the tunnel, but it is hard sometimes.â€ Lisa Bachelor and Juliet Stott  The Thompson family  The budget brought a sigh of relief for the Thompsons: there had been media speculation that the chancellor could tax disability living allowance (DLA) payments as part of his Â£12bn welfare cuts package, which would have left them at least Â£1,000 a year out of pocket.  Elizabeth and Andy Thompson of Selby, north Yorkshire, claim Â£400 DLA every four weeks on behalf of their eldest daughter Eleanor, aged seven, who is deaf. The cash is vital to help the family cope with the expense of the 100-mile round trips for Eleanorâ€™s regular hospital appointments.  They have also used it to help pay for sign language lessons for Andy, and for specialist books and equipment for Eleanor.  However, the chancellor didnâ€™t tax DLA and promised that â€“ unlike many other benefits and tax credits which were frozen â€“ it would continue to rise in line with inflation each year.  â€œItâ€™s a relief,â€ said Elizabeth, â€œDLA helps us with the additional costs of ensuring Eleanor lives a normal life. Having it takes the pressure off.â€  Elizabeth was also pleased, as someone who makes monthly trips with Eleanor to see medical specialists, that the chancellor pledged to make the NHS a spending priority: â€œI was very encouraged to see increases in NHS funding. Itâ€™s good news that the NHS is going to be protected.â€  The National Deaf Childrenâ€™s Society had been lobbying to protect the value of DLA payments. Taxing or freezing it would have left many families struggling to pay for extra support, including therapy, specialist equipment, travel costs and communication support.  Elizabeth, like her husband a civil engineer, thought that overall the budget was â€œnot too badâ€. But she remains cautious about the future: â€œIf the government is going to continue to make cuts, who knows what next year brings?â€ Patrick Butler  Tim Graves  The initial indications are that Tim Graves, 51, will be â€œa bit over Â£100 a year better offâ€ as a result of the tax changes in the budget. He lives near Farnborough, Hampshire, and has a â€œrelatively well-paidâ€ job as a solutions specialist for a large computer company.  He has mixed views about the contents of George Osborneâ€™s budget box. Having worked for the same employer since 1989 he has been able to pay a decent amount into savings and pensions: â€œIâ€™ve put something like Â£20,000 a year into my pension.â€  Graves had been fearing a pensions â€œraidâ€ but believes he is unaffected by the cuts to the pensions tax relief enjoyed by high earners, though he will be meeting his financial adviser. He says the cut in the lifetime allowance â€“ the maximum amount that can be saved into a pension â€“ from Â£1.25m to Â£1m from April 2016 that was announced in the March budget is â€œa worry for me â€“ and not just me, but an awful lot of peopleâ€.  Iâ€™ve thought about buy-to-let and I have to say that Iâ€™m not sure I agree with it morally. Itâ€™s driving up house prices  Tim Graves  As predicted, Osborne announced changes that he said would lift all but the very richest households out of inheritance tax. However, Graves, who is single with no children, says he suspects he is probably â€œunusualâ€ in that he personally did not have any issues with the inheritance tax threshold staying lower. â€œIâ€™m responsible for myself, and I personally donâ€™t need [the money from his parents]. If the offspring are reliant on their parents dying, thatâ€™s a pretty iffy financial proposition anyway.â€  The budget included a tax relief cut for buy-to-let landlords. Graves is unaffected â€“ he has lodgers but doesnâ€™t own an investment property. â€œIâ€™ve thought about buy-to-let and I have to say that Iâ€™m not sure I agree with it morally. Itâ€™s driving up house prices.â€  He also has concerns about how the changes to tax credits will affect some people, and as someone who donates a reasonable amount to charity he says he wishes there could have been measures to make it easier and quicker to support good causes, such as improvements to the gift-aid regime. Rupert Jones  Nigel Dowdney  Itâ€™s hard to miss the colourful facade of the Stalham Shopper convenience store in the north Norfolk town from which it takes its name, but owner Nigel Dowdney (above) fears for the worst if proposals to relax current Sunday trading laws become a reality in this area. He also worries about how much the new national living wage will increase his staffing costs.  In his budget speech the chancellor gave the green light for counties and elected mayors to be handed new powers to set Sunday trading hours in their areas.  The owner of two convenience stores â€“ one in Stalham and the other closer to Norwich â€“ Dowdney says he would have to consider closing at least one because of the inevitable haemorrhage of business to larger supermarkets who would be allowed to trade for an extra two hours on Sundays.  The Stalham store is located just 500m from a Tesco outlet and would be badly affected by changes to trading hours. The arrival of Tesco had already had a major impact on the town and it was important to limit any further adverse effects, he said.  He had a taste of the possible impact when trading hours were relaxed during the Olympics in 2012. â€œIn the first three Sundays my shop lost 20% of its sales and 30% of its footfall â€“ and that is in a period when we would usually see an increase in footfall and sales due to people coming here on holiday.â€  On a typical Sunday the usual pattern is that the Stalham shop has steady business until 4pm (when Tesco closes), followed by a spike in footfall at around 5pm-6pm until it closes at 9pm, as people stock up with food and drink for the evening.  Dowdney employs 31 staff across the two sites and fears that he might have to cut jobs and even close a store if the council agrees to relax legislation. The new national living wage would also bump up his wage bill. He admits: â€œI rely on Sunday trading and â€“ along with similar restrictions at Easter â€“ it is what keeps us going.â€ Rebecca Smithers  Michael Brisbourne Shop-owner Michael Brisbourne reckons it was a â€œgoodâ€ budget overall, and firmly supports the scrapping of inheritance tax on the vast majority of family homes. But he was less keen on the decision to cut pension tax relief for higher earners.  Brisbourne, 52, is the director of the Peterborough Recliner Centre, a furniture store in the city which he bought about five years ago, and he has one full-time and one part-time employee.  Cuts to inheritance tax mean the amount people can leave to their children tax-free will eventually increase to Â£1m if it includes a family home. Brisbourne, who lives on his own and owns a flat, said: â€œI think thatâ€™s great. We all go to work to make a better life for ourselves, and we all pay tax, so I donâ€™t see why I canâ€™t leave [my property] to my family.â€  If someone is paying into something to look after their future, why should they be penalised?  Michael Brisbourne  Brisbourne pays into a pension but does not fall into the higher earner category being targeted by the chancellor. Nevertheless, he does not support the cut in pensions tax relief which will affect those earning more than Â£110,000 a year. â€œI donâ€™t agree with that. If someone is paying into something to look after their future, why should they be penalised for it?â€  Brisbourneâ€™s accountant, Shaz Nawaz at AA Accountants in Peterborough, said the move on pensions tax relief was â€œshort-sightedâ€, adding: â€œWe should be encouraging people to invest more into their pension pots, especially as weâ€™re living longer as a nation.â€ Rupert Jones",1
ASK NOEL,"Noel Whittaker answers your questions

I'M 29, on a gross salary of $70,000 and have no debts apart from a $25,000 HECS debt. What should I do with a spare $10,000? I considered making a voluntary HECS repayment to benefit from the bonus (discount for upfront payment) but wonder whether I would be better to put it into super, invest it or put it into a first home saver account, although I'm not considering buying property for another few years.
My preference is for the first home saver account as you will receive a guaranteed 17 per cent tax free on the first $5500, but this is only a viable option if you intend to buy a home in the foreseeable future. Keep in mind that the home saver account must be open for four financial years before you can access your money.  My wife and I are both in our mid-50s. We work full time and have two dependent children at university. We have been putting the maximum amount allowed into our super for many years. We are conservative in our investing habits: some shares and no investment properties. We live in a modest house. However, we have also been saving outside of our super with large sums in term deposits. What investment choices do we have without being penalised by the 46.5 per cent tax on interest income?  At your age the perfect choice is to contribute the money to super as a non-concessional contribution. Earnings will then be taxed at 15 per cent and because of your age you could withdraw the money if you had to stop work. Just keep in mind that such contributions are limited to $150,000 a year or $450,000 if you contribute three years in one lump sum.  Noel Whittaker, AM, is a co-founder of Whittaker Macnaught.

Ask Brianna: Can I Give to Charity If Money Is Tight?,"'Ask Brianna' is a Q&A column for 20-somethings or anyone else starting out. I'm here to help you manage your money, find a job and pay off student loans "" all the real-world stuff no one taught us how to do in college. Send your questions about postgrad life to askbrianna@nerdwallet.com.

This week's question:
'This time of year, I'm getting a lot of requests to donate money, but bills and debt payments are hanging over my head. I want to be generous. Can I give to charity anyway?'  Congratulations: You have a heart. The desire to donate comes from a place of compassion and empathy, and it's worth celebrating.  'We can't avoid being human and wanting to help others,' says Derrick Feldmann, lead researcher on the Millennial Impact Project, which studies millennials' philanthropic behavior.  Feldmann says millennials donate $200 to $300 a year on average, and closer to $400 in years when major natural disasters occur.  While you can't give money you don't have, it's possible to do your part to save the world even with, say, thousands of dollars in student loan debt. You're financially ready to give if you are:  * Earning more money than you spend  * Paying at least the minimum on your debts, on time, every time  * Saving regularly for the future in both emergency and retirement funds: That means setting aside at least $500 for unexpected expenses and contributing enough to get the company match on your 401(k) "" or saving in an individual retirement account  Once you've determined you can spare some cash for charity, follow these tips on how to do it. And if donating isn't possible this year, consider volunteering or participating in activism instead.  Build your values into your budget  Your question is about spending money on what you value most, and that's all budgeting really is. Figure out what you can spare by looking at how much is available for discretionary spending.  Using the 50/30/20 guideline, aim to spend no more than 30% of your after-tax income on wants (50% of your take-home pay goes to needs like housing, food and utilities; 20% goes to paying down debt and saving for the future). Decide how much of the 30% you want to give away. Maybe you'll decide $20 a month can go to charity.  This approach makes it easy to set up automatic recurring donations, instead of giving lump sums at the end of the year, says Elise Murphy, a certified financial planner at Level Financial Advisors in Amherst, New York. You won't feel crunched or drain your bank account in November and December, when you're also buying holiday gifts and traveling to see family.  Donate strategically  Once you've earmarked your precious cash for charity, put it to good use.  * Donate your full charitable giving budget to just one or two organizations, says Eileen Heisman, CEO of the National Philanthropic Trust. Sending $10 to 20 different organizations won't make as big an impact, because it costs money to process every donation.  If you give more to one, 'the charity will have more net money to actually devote to programs,' she says.  * Ask if your workplace matches donations, which will make your money go further.  * Keep records of your donations; you can deduct them from your taxable income if you itemize on your tax return and the organization qualifies under IRS rules. Check its eligibility using the IRS' Exempt Organizations search tool.  * Make sure you're giving to reputable organizations. View nonprofits' financial information by signing up for a free account on GuideStar.org, or check out the Better Business Bureau's reports on individual charities on Give.org.  Give your time instead  Sure, of millennials who have been more involved with causes or social issues since the 2016 election, the largest share "" 35% "" said they'd donated more money. That's according to the 2017 Millennial Impact Report, released by Achieve, a cause-focused research and marketing agency. But the next-largest share said they volunteered more, followed by those who said they joined more nonprofit boards.  Your budget may simply be too tight to contribute money; maybe rent alone takes up half your take-home pay. If you've decided animal welfare is your cause of choice, volunteer at a shelter or to walk dogs for elderly pet owners. Sign petitions, attend community meetings or participate in a run or walk to raise awareness of an issue.  'You don't have to have any money to make a difference,' Feldmann says.

Buying a home at 70?,"Dear Edith: What do you think of an older person buying a house or a condo? I'll be 70 this year. I am single, and I have excellent credit. I've been looking for an apartment, and landlords seem to really jack up the prices, at lease this time of year. I pay $1,100 a month, so I think I can afford a mortgage. Thanks for your thoughts. - M.

I know nothing about your finances or where you're looking, so I can't give you advice on that score. But being older is no reason why you shouldn't become a homeowner. I'm old enough to be your mother, and I still live in my own house.
At any rate, mortgage lenders are not allowed to discriminate on the basis of age. They cannot even ask how old you are.  And, by the way, you might prefer a condo so you can be free of maintenance worries and expenses.

The Color of Money: Overdraft fees are a menace,"I know the damage bank overdraft fees can do to a person's finances and self-worth.

For all his adult life, I helped my brother Mitchell manage his money, although he insisted that he handle his own banking. Mitchell, who died at 32, suffered severe seizures because of his epilepsy. As a result, his only source of income was Social Security disability.
My brother did his best to live within his means. But a few times, he overdrew his bank account. When he did, he would berate himself.  Overdraft charges and non-sufficient-fund fees are a menace to the most financially vulnerable, like my brother. So, it's worth noting that Capital One says it's eliminating all overdraft fees and non-sufficient-fund fees for its consumer banking customers.  Could this be a trendsetting move for other big banks, which rake in the most money in overdraft fees? I certainly hope so, but if it isn't, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ought to step in.  A few other financial institutions have eliminated overdraft fees, but as Capital One pointed out, it's the nation's sixth-largest retail bank and stands alone among the top 10 banks in getting rid of the fees. Customers enrolled in overdraft protection will automatically be converted to its no-fee policy early next year. For customers not enrolled, transactions that would overdraw their account will be declined, with no fees assessed.  ""The bank account is a cornerstone of a person's financial life,"" said Capital One's founder and chief executive, Richard Fairbank, in a statement. ""Eliminating overdraft fees is another step in our effort to bring ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking.""  I was struck by Fairbank's use of the word ""humanity."" For years, consumer advocates have been critical of the abusive nature of such fees. They are menacing and inhumane.  ""Bank overdraft fees cause particular harm to low-income consumers and communities of color, who are already disproportionately excluded from the banking mainstream,"" said a 2020 report from the Center for Responsible Lending. While the typical overdraft fee is $35, the report said, ""the cost to the bank of processing an overdraft transaction, particularly in today's highly automated environment, is very low.""  Think about this.  The most common transactions that generate an overdraft fee involve the use of a debit card. And those transactions are only $20 on average, according to the center's report. The report also pointed out the tricks of this trade that can trigger overdraft fees even when people are trying to be careful to avoid them.  One practice is imposing overdraft fees on debit card transactions that were authorized when consumers had enough money in their accounts. But by the time the bank settles the transaction, the customer might not have sufficient funds.  Or this fee-generating strategy cited in the report: ""Banks have notoriously re-ordered transactions to drive up the number of overdraft fees incurred; if larger balances are posted first, the account is depleted more quickly, resulting in more transactions for which the bank charges overdraft fees.""  Overdraft fees or the fear of them are keeping millions of Americans outside the banking system, leaving many to be preyed upon by payday loan companies or rent-to-own establishments. Or they end up paying unnecessary fees to cash checks. This is what my brother did before I persuaded him to open a bank account.  In the U.S., an estimated 7.1 million households, or 5.4%, were ""unbanked"" in 2019, meaning that no one in the household had a checking or savings account at a bank or credit union, according to a report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.  Lower-income and minority populations are disproportionately represented among unbanked households. Nearly 14% of Black and 12% of Hispanic households are unbanked, compared with 2.5% of white households, according to the FDIC.  The CFPB released a report in 2017 that found many consumers who get hit with overdraft fees tend to carry low balances and have relatively low monthly deposits. It then promised to escalate the study of the fees, a move that could have led to stronger consumer protections.  But under the Trump administration, the CFPB, then led by former congressman Mick Mulvaney, backed away from a rulemaking plan to address bank overdraft-fee abuses.  The Biden administration can't leave it up to the banking industry as a whole to do what Capital One did, because the money is too good for them to do the right thing.",1
"Tax law will allow Nebraska's NEST 529 plan to be used for K-12 private, religious schools","As soon as Karisa Malchow's toddlers were issued Social Security numbers, so began the college savings journey for the 3Â½-year-old and 20-month-old boys.

With another baby on the way, this one due in March, Malchow says she's convinced that the family has found the right blueprint to sock money away for education expenses.
Once the federal government assigns Baby No. 3 her nine-digit identifier sometime after she's born, Malchow and her husband will open another tax-advantaged education savings account under the Nebraska Education Savings Trust program.  Known better by the acronym and federal tax code chapter under which ""qualified tuition programs"" are exempt from taxation, NEST 529 plans continue to grow in popularity as millennials â€” roughly, those born between 1981 and 1997, who now comprise the largest living generation in the U.S. â€” begin to start families of their own.  Collective balances of NEST 529 accounts are up $300 million since August and stand at $4.8 billion, according to First National Bank of Omaha, which administers the program for the Nebraska state treasurer. Balances have more than doubled since December 2010 when First National took over administration duties, and the number of active accounts is up about 40 percent since then to 355,000. Today, about 16 percent of Nebraska families participate in the plans, compared with 11 percent in 2010.  An amendment to the federal tax package that recently made its way through Congress may open the door for even more growth.  The Student Opportunity Amendment allows 529 plans to be used for private and religious schools for kindergarten through 12th grades.  Deborah Goodkin is managing director of savings plans including NEST 529 at First National and says the act would be ""a big change.""  She declined to speculate on just how much of an influx of new savings the change may bring in, but said she anticipates a bill to be introduced in the upcoming Nebraska legislative session to square up state law with federal tax law.  ""Nebraska has a lot of kids going to parochial schools, especially in the eastern part of the state,"" Goodkin said.  In Nebraska, about 11 percent of the state's roughly 357,000 students were enrolled in nonpublic institutions in the fall of the 2016-2017 school year. That's slightly more than the 10 percent figure nationally, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.  Even though the plans' $10,000 annual withdrawal limit most likely wouldn't cover full payment of tuition at local private schools â€” annual tuition at Omaha religious schools can cost anywhere from $10,000 to more than $20,000 â€” multiple accounts for individual students could provide a tax shelter for some.  But it could be more trouble than it's worth, said Paul von Hippel, an assistant professor in the Lyndon B. Johnson School for Public Affairs at the University of Texas-Austin.  Von Hippel said the shorter-term investment timeline for primary and secondary education doesn't match up with the longer-term design of 529 plans.  A family that puts away $100 a month as soon as a child is born would save about $50,000 by the time the child is 18, assuming a healthy return of 8 percent. Dipping into that account any sooner would thwart returns.  That means any tax benefits sought by private-school parents plopping $10,000 in every year (that's the maximum income tax deduction allowed for such plans in Nebraska) would maybe be ""a few hundred dollars,"" von Hippel said.  ""Necessarily, if you're using these for elementary school, you'll be taking out money sooner than if you're using them for secondary school, and sooner than for college,"" von Hippel said. ""As a result, the tax benefits are smaller.""  President Donald Trump signed the tax overhaul on Friday.  Meanwhile, some Nebraskans who have been socking away money in 529 plans have other things on their minds.  ""The biggest concern is that it's easy to think 'We're so far ahead, but will it be enough?' "" said Malchow, 27, an account director at Omaha-based marketing firm OBI Creative.  Her concern is well-founded: Student loan debt has increased more than fivefold over the past 14 years, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and at $1.36 trillion, it constitutes the second-largest class of household debt behind mortgage debt at $8.74 trillion. That puts loan balances for things like course credits, books and room and board ahead of credit card debt and mortgage debt.  As those costs continue to rise, Shannon Wallace said her concern (or hope) is getting her 15-year-old son, Ted Wagner, through an undergraduate program without taking on any student loan debt. Wallace has been saving money in a NEST 529 account since Ted was about 5 years old.  Now a freshman at Elkhorn South High School, Ted only recently learned that his parents â€” and grandparents, aunts and uncles â€” have been contributing to his higher education expenses since before he started kindergarten in 2007.  ""A lot of times when Ted was little, he didn't know he got money, so being the mom, I just threw it in the NEST account,"" Wallace said.  Those contributions in addition to an automatic deduction out of Wallace's paycheck, plus investment returns over about 10 years, have ""doubled"" the investment in the Elkhorn South student's 529 plan over time, Wallace said.  And lately there's been yet another contributor to the student's future college education.  ""Now that he's older, he'll put some in savings and then give me some to put in the NEST account,"" Wallace said.  (Account contributions to NEST accounts must be postmarked by Sunday to qualify for the 2017 tax year state income tax deduction; electronic contributions must be received by 10:59 p.m. Central time on Sunday to qualify.)",1
No-load funds are the only way to go,"Q: Being 65 and retired, I would like to use the monthly withdrawals from my individual retirement account to invest in mutual funds. What kind of funds would you recommend for me? And how can I get information on no-load funds without going through a securities brokerage firm or some similar organization charging commissions?

A: It's a cinch you realized the answer to your first query would be ""true no-load funds"" - those charging no commission when you buy shares, no redemption fee or contingent deferred sales charge when you cash in shares and no 12b-1 fee constantly eroding share value.
You can obtain a directory of such funds and information about them by sending $3 to the 100 Percent No-Load Mutual Fund Council, 1501 Broadway, Suite 1809, New York, N.Y. 10036.  This column has always favored true no-load mutual funds. The charges such funds eliminate go to pay for sales efforts. By doing away with the sales force, true no-load funds have eliminated those charges.  Despite claims to the contrary by some hotshot sales types, sales charges do not enhance any mutual fund's investment performance. Many of the mutual funds at or near the top of the performance charts are no-load funds.  As a retired senior citizen, you should invest in relatively conservative mutual funds. ""Balanced funds"" - those holding both common stocks and fixed-income securities such as bonds and preferred stocks - seem right for you.  But, rather than make withdrawals from your IRA, why don't you open a balanced mutual fund account within your IRA and move some IRA money there. You can do that in one shot or gradually. The latter is my recommendation.  That way, you will ""dollar cost average,"" buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high, thus reducing your risk.  Q: My wife and I have all our stocks registered in joint ownership. Please use what you call your ""old standby"" - stock in XYZ Corp. - to explain how the basis steps up when one of the two owners dies.  A: OK. We'll start by saying you bought 100 shares of XYZ at a total cost, including brokerage commission, and other fees, of $2,000. And we'll say XYZ's market value is $40 a share on the day you go to the happy hunting grounds. Your wife becomes the sole owner of the 100 shares, worth $4,000.  Her new basis is $3,000. That's calculated by adding $1,000 (her half of the original cost basis) and $2,000 (the basis of the half-ownership she received as a result of your death).",1
"Newfangled Data Aside, Credit Scores Still Matter","Researchers and startups say all kinds of weird data can predict your creditworthiness. What kind of smartphone you have, who your friends are and how you answer survey questions may foretell how likely you are to pay back a loan.

Don't expect this alternative data to displace the three-digit number most lenders use, however. Credit scores still matter â€” a lot.
Lenders use credit scores to decide whether you get loans and credit cards, plus the rates you pay. Scores are also used to determine which apartments you can rent, which cell phone plans you can get and, in most states, how much you pay for auto and homeowners insurance.  The central problem with credit scores is that they can't be generated unless people actively use credit accounts. Millions of people don't, but they still may be creditworthy. Alternative data is being used to sniff them out.  What may predict your risk of default  Some U.S. lenders, for example, factor in how often people change addresses, how they pay noncredit bills such as rent or cell phone plans and how they handle their bank accounts. FICO, the leading credit scoring company, has found that people who have savings, maintain higher balances in their checking accounts and don't overdraft may be good credit risks. The company is developing a new ""opt in"" score that would allow lenders, with consumers' permission, to factor in bank account behavior when evaluating loan applications.  In Russia, applicants can get loans based on answers to ""psychometric"" surveys that evaluate their verbal and arithmetical skills. Meanwhile, a study of a German e-commerce company's transactions found people's ""digital footprints"" â€” whether they use iPhones, have numbers in their email addresses or shop at night â€” can predict their risk of default. (If you're curious, iPhone users are less likely to default than Android users, while those who have email numbers or shop late are more likely to default, according to the study.)  Alternative data hasn't displaced credit scores  Not all alternative methods will pass muster with regulators and gain widespread acceptance with lenders. Social media feeds, for example, showed some early promise, but enthusiasm for that idea waned once lenders considered the regulatory hurdles.  ""No bank wants to be tagged with 'they denied me because of my Twitter feed' regardless of how predictive it may be,"" says credit expert John Ulzheimer.  Similarly, the credit scores of people in your household and in your social circle may predict how creditworthy you are, but mainstream lenders aren't likely to embrace scores based on other people's behavior.  ""Factors should be palatable and fair in addition to being predictive and compliant,"" says Ethan Dornhelm, FICO's vice president for scores and predictive analytics. ""Saying 'You've got the wrong friends' â€” it doesn't sit well.""  For now and the foreseeable future, focus on your scores  Much of the research has found that alternative data works best when used in conjunction with, rather than as a replacement for, traditional credit scores. So the best way to keep your financial options open remains the same: keeping your credit scores strong. That means you should:  Have credit. If you're trying to build or rebuild your scores, consider a secured card that gives you a line of credit equal to the deposit you make with the issuing bank. Other options include a credit-builder loan from a credit union or online lender or being added as an authorized user to a creditworthy person's account.Actively use credit. You don't need to carry a balance on your credit cards, which is fortunate: credit card debt is usually expensive and almost always unwise. But regularly using credit cards helps maintain your scores. So can paying installment loans, such as student loans, car loans and mortgages.Avoid using too much credit. Maxing out your credit cards or applying for too many cards in a short period can ding your scores. The less of your credit limits you use, the better, even when you pay in full every month.

"Breaking with the bonds of the past; Once the darlings of our parents, CSBs can no longer provide young people with the savings kick they need","When I get cash as a holiday gift, it tends to disappear almost instantly. Most young people in their early 20s, like myself, are good at spending money, but we struggle to save it. After a particularly fruitful shopping excursion on Boxing Day, I was urged by my frustrated parents to put what little amount remained into a savings bond so I could sit back and watch the money grow.

This isn't the first time I've heard the suggestion to put my money to better use, but it's starting to sink in that investing a small amount might be a practical endeavour for someone who is planning to purchase a house and start a family within the next few years. But like many young, financially illiterate adults, I knew little about bonds, apart from the fact that my relatives think they make good gifts as an alternative to giving cash.
My parents recall the good old days when savings bonds made the best Christmas gifts. When my dad was around eight years old during the early 1960s, his grandfather gave him his first $100 bond. Although foggy on the details, he distinctly remembers thinking it seemed almost magical that money could increase over time. It was kind of magical - in the early 1980s, you could count on government savings bonds paying rates as high as 19.5%.  But as popular as government savings bonds were during the First and Second World War eras and into my father's adolescence as a safe, secure way to save money, these bonds are now considered the laughing stock of the fast-paced investing world. Investors sneer at these bonds for one simple reason - the painfully low interest rates that are now barely able to keep up with inflation at around 2%. Factoring in tax along with fluctuating interest rates and inflation, growth over a long term period could be minimal.  Since interest rates are at an alltime low as we roll into 2012, with Canadian Premium bonds paying a measly 1% annual interest rate provided you lock in for one year and Canada Savings Bonds offering an even lower yield to maturity at 0.65%, are government bonds a viable option for people with low income? Jason Heath, financial consultant for E.E.S. Financial Services Ltd., believes there are better plans out there to build up your nest egg.  Sorry dad.  (Both doctors, my parents always say asking them for financial advice is like asking a banker for a medical analysis.)  Nearly 3.8 million Canadians invest in CSBs or their premium cousin purchased through banks or payroll savings programs, but the amount of money invested continues to steadily drop along with interest rates themselves. The Investment Funds Institute of Canada says bond funds net sales totalled $938.9-million by June 2011, plummeting from $3.50-billion during the same period just a year earlier.  Decisions to invest really depend on assessing risk. Mr. Heath notes that although investors might not have earned a hefty return from their government bonds in 2011, those who opted to invest in stocks suffered a blow with the TSX down 11% that year.  ""You might as well have put the money under your mattress and been better off at the end of the day,"" he jokes.  But before young investors rush into any plans, Mr. Heath says they need to take a step back and think about what they want to do with the money.  ""Whether you are young or old, the money should be tied to a specific goal,"" he explains.  And if that goal is to move out of your parents' house or purchase a car within the next five years, and you don't have ample time to wait for your bonds to mature, then the financial consultant recommends exploring the more conservative option of low-interest bonds tucked into a tax-free savings account.  ""Interest rates are so low as it is, if you can shelter that interest income in a TFSA, at least you're not letting taxes limit your returns as well,"" he says.  A savings balance, he says, will help young adults pay off their impending expenses.  What's more, these kinds of accounts can be useful for long-term growth. Drawing on his own experience as a young adult, Mr. Heath favours them over RRSPs because all withdrawals are tax-free.  ""I made the mistake when I was not as financially astute by dumping a whole bunch of money into my RRSP toward my retirement. However, after buying some houses and having two babies, I could not touch the funds unless I paid taxes on them,"" he explains. But he notes that RRSPS are better than the alternative, which is to spend money rather than save it.  Even though there is a wealth of information out there about the different options to invest money or what percentage of a paycheque should be saved, Mr. Heath reiterates that young people must avoid the rule-of-thumb advice.  ""Lots of people make the argument that you are young and have so long until you retire; therefore you should put it all into the stock market and forget about it,"" he says.  ""I disagree. The future expenses for the remainder of a 20-year-old's life are much more than that of a 40-year-old.""",1
Don't Wait Until Sickness Strikes Before Making A Will,"Making a will when you are close to death and without professional assistance is an effective means of fostering dispute between your loved ones after you are gone. As a High Court case strikingly showed, that is particularly so if you intend to leave your estate outside your immediate family.

The case concerned an exceptionally intelligent man whose life had been blighted by mental health difficulties. He was eloquent and talkative and had built his life around friendships formed with lodgers in his substantial home. His complex and difficult personality had led to estrangement from his brother and sister, although contact resumed between them in the weeks and months before his death.
He was in hospital, suffering from the brain tumour which caused his death less than two months later, when he was alleged to have made a will leaving everything he owned to a longstanding friend and confidante. His siblings, who would have inherited his estate as his next of kin had he died without making a will, launched proceedings challenging the document's validity.  The Court found that the will was duly executed. Arguments that the man was so unwell that he would have been unable to hold the pen used to sign the document were rejected. Also finding that he had the mental capacity required to make a valid will, the Court noted that treatment with steroids had at the relevant me brought a temporary improvement in his condition.  The beneficiary and one of the two witnesses to the will had in some respects acted in an underhand manner. They had provided the impetus for making the will and they had concealed what they were doing from the man's brother. There was, however, no suggestion that they had brought undue influence to bear and the Court was satisfied that the will ultimately reflected the man's true wishes.  Upholding the will's validity, the Court found that the man's intention was to benefit the group of friends that he considered his family. Although he was in the grip of progressive brain damage due to the tumour, he was able to understand and approve the simple contents of the will. The document was read to him and he probably read it through himself, as best he could, before signing it.  Gardiner v Tabet & Anr.(2020]ewhc 1471 (Ch)Davey & Anr v Bailey & Ors [2021] EWHC 445 (Ch). In another case the wishes of the deceased were not able to be fulfilled. In a devoted couple had built up considerable wealth during their marriage. Each of them had made wills leaving everything to the other. However, the documents were about a decade old when the wife died from cancer. The grief-stricken husband later suffered a fatal heart attack and survived the wife by only about four months. The wife's estate passed to the husband in accordance with her will. After she died, he made an appointment with a solicitor with a view to making a new will. No such will was executed prior to his death, however. The wife no longer being alive to inherit his estate, the husband died intestate. The end result was that all the couple's assets passed to the husband's next of kin and the wife's family received nothing. The wife's brother and sister launched proceedings on the basis that the couple had given them substantial parts of their respective estates shortly before they died. The gifts were said to be enforceable deathbed gifts in that they had been made by the couple in contemplation of their imminent deaths. Ruling on the matter the Court noted that both husband and wife were devoted to their respective families, which were closely intertwined. The evidence indicated that it was highly likely that the couple intended that both their families should benefit substantially from their estates. In rejecting the claim, however, the Court found that the strict criteria which must be met before a deathbed gift can be legally binding had not been fulfilled. The Court expressed considerable sympathy for the wife's family, who had effectively been disinherited. However, there was nothing to prevent them receiving voluntary gifts from the husband's estate if his family chose to make them.

Saving for Retirement When You're in the Military,"Make the most of special savings plans and new rules.

It's easy to focus only on day-to-day issues when you're in the military and miss out on valuable benefits that can improve your financial situation over the long run.
SEE ALSO: 10 Best Financial Benefits for Military Families  But servicemembers have access to special savings opportunities that aren't available to most people, so it's important to take advantage of these programs while you can.  Many servicemembers overlook the importance of saving because they hope to retire from the military after 20 years and receive pension income for life. However, fewer than 18% of servicemembers stay long enough to qualify for military retirement pay. The rest get nothing.  Unlike civilian jobs, there is no partial vesting under the current system if you leave before 20 years. Even if you do end up getting the pension, your retirement income could be as little as 50% of your base pay (more if you stay longer than 20 years), leaving you to fill in the gaps yourself. And major changes are coming soon to the military retirement system, which will provide new opportunities for servicemembers who don't stay for 20 years. But the new system could also reduce your lifetime income and make it even more important to save on your own. Because of these changes, many servicemembers will need to make key decisions about their financial futures in 2018.  No matter which retirement system you choose, it's essential to save on your own, too. The younger you are when you start setting aside money for your future, the easier it will be to build a healthy nest egg. While you are in the military, you can take advantage of special investing programs and tax breaks to help you supercharge your savings--even if you can only afford to set aside a little money now. It's up to you to make the most of your options.  Begin With the Thrift Savings Plan  The government's Thrift Savings Plan is a great place to start saving. Members of the military can invest in this tax-advantaged retirement savings plan for federal employees, which is similar to a private company's 401(k) plan but with extremely low fees. You can invest up to $18,000 in the TSP in 2016, and even more if you're receiving tax-free income while deployed--boosting the limit to $53,000 this year.  The TSP provides valuable tax advantages, no matter how much you can afford to invest, and a new rule gives you the option to take the tax breaks now or build up tax-free income for the future.  If you choose to make traditional contributions, the money you set aside reduces your taxable income now and grows tax-deferred until retirement. For example, contributing $10,000 cuts your take-home pay by just $7,500 if you're in the 25% federal tax bracket (even less if your contributions also escape state income tax).  Alternatively, you now have the option to make Roth TSP contributions, which don't provide a tax break now but do let you withdraw the money tax-free in retirement. This is similar to a Roth IRA but without any income limits to block contributions. (Note that contributions from tax-free pay in a combat zone will never be taxed.)  With either version of the TSP, your contributions can grow significantly over the years if you start early. Say you contribute $300 each paycheck to a traditional TSP. Your take-home pay will only shrink by $225 if you are in the 25% tax bracket. And if you start at age 25 and contribute for the next 30 years, you could end up with more than $900,000 by the time you're 55! Even if you leave the military at age 40 after 15 years of contributions and never add another dime to your TSP account, you could still end up with about $700,000 by age 55. These examples assume your investments return 8% per year, which has been a typical average for long-term investments.  As mentioned above, if you forego the tax break on your contributions now and instead contribute to the Roth version of the TSP, your withdrawals will be totally tax-free in retirement. If your taxable income is lower now than it will be in the future, you'll come out ahead with the Roth.  SEE ALSO: 8 Smart Financial Moves to Make in 2017 If You're in the Military  ""For most people relying primarily on military income, the Roth is generally the way to go,"" says Patrick Beagle, a certified financial planner in Springfield, Va., who is also a former helicopter pilot who retired from the Marines and specializes in helping military families with their finances. ""They are generally in the lowest bracket they will ever be in, because of all of the non-tax compensation.""  Take Advantage of Low-Cost Investing  You have several low-cost investing options in the TSP. You can choose from five index mutual funds investing in large companies, small firms, international firms, bonds or government securities.  Or you can choose a lifecycle fund (called the L fund), which builds a diversified portfolio of the other funds to match your time horizon. The fund invests primarily in stock funds at the start, when you have more than a decade before you plan to tap the money. And it gradually becomes more conservative as your retirement date draws near. Choosing the L fund is an easy way to invest.  Expenses for all of the funds are extremely low--about 29 cents a year for every $1,000 invested--making the TSP one of the lowest-cost investing options available. For a $100,000 portfolio, for example, you'd pay just $29 a year in investment management fees.  You can keep the money in the TSP after you leave the military, or you can roll it into an IRA or another employer's 401(k), where it will continue to grow tax-deferred. Just be aware that if you take the money from a traditional TSP and spend it, you could face an immediate tax bill. What's more, you'll generally face a 10% penalty if you withdraw the money from the account before age 59 Â½ (unless you leave your job after age 55).  See tsp.gov for more information and a calculator to help you project your future account balance and see the power of long-term compounding of earnings.  An extra incentive to save: If you're having a tough time putting aside money for retirement, consider that your contributions can also earn you an extra tax break. The Retirement Savings Contribution Credit is worth 10% to 50% of the first $2,000 you contribute for the year to the TSP, an IRA or another retirement savings plan. The lower your income, the higher your credit.  It's worth $1,000 per person at the lowest income levels. But it drops to $200 if you are near the cutoff--$30,500 for single filers; $45,750 for filing head of household; or $61,000 if married filing jointly. These limits are based on adjusted gross income, which doesn't include your tax-free housing allowance or any tax-free pay received while in a combat zone.  Tax-Free Earnings From a Roth IRA  A Roth IRA can be a great way for anyone to supplement their retirement savings--you generally don't get a tax break for Roth contributions, but you can withdraw your earnings tax-free in retirement (and can withdraw contributions at any time without taxes or penalties). And deployed servicemembers get an extra perk: If you're receiving tax-free pay in a combat zone, your money goes into the Roth tax-free, and your contributions as well as your earnings come out tax-free in retirement.  You can contribute up to $5,500 to a Roth IRA in 2016 (or $6,500 if you're 50 or older) as long as your modified adjusted gross income is less than $117,000 for single filers, or $184,000 if married filing jointly. (The opportunity to make contributions gradually phases out as income rises above those levels.)  SEE ALSO: Why You Need a Roth IRA  You can open a Roth IRA with a brokerage firm, mutual fund company, credit union or bank. When selecting an IRA administrator, look for low fees and a range of investment choices. If you have 20 or 30 years until retirement, it's usually best to invest the money in a diversified portfolio of mutual funds. (See the Investor Protection Trust's series of investor education booklets for more information about creating a portfolio.)  Note that you can invest the maximum in both a Roth IRA and the Thrift Savings Plan in the same year. And you have until April 15 of the following year to make an IRA contribution (or a few days later if the 15th falls on a weekend). For example, April 17, 2017, is the deadline for 2016 contributions.  Finally, if you have a spouse who doesn't earn income, you can contribute to an IRA on his or her behalf. And children who earn income from a job also can contribute to a Roth IRA, which can be a great way to get them started saving for the future.  Guaranteed Return on Savings  It sounds almost too good to be true--10% interest guaranteed. But in this case it's no scam: The military's Savings Deposit Program lets servicemembers invest up to $10,000 in the program each time they are deployed. You receive 10% annual interest, compounded quarterly, and can keep the money in the account while you're deployed and up to three months after you return.  For more information, see the SDP page at the Defense Finance and Accounting website.  What You Need to Know About the New Retirement System  You may need to make a major decision about your financial future in 2018 because the military is introducing a new retirement system.  While the new system reduces the guaranteed income available after 20 years, it provides matching contributions to your Thrift Savings Plan, which you can keep after just two years of service. Your options depend on the year you entered the military.  Before 2006. If you joined the military before January 1, 2006, you're covered under the original system. You need to stay for at least 20 years to qualify for the military pension, which can be worth 50% (more if you stay longer) of your basic pay. See the section below for more information about how retirement pay is calculated.  From 2006 to 2017. If you joined from January 1, 2006, to December 31, 2017, then you'll need to make a big choice. You can stay with the old system, or you can sign up for the new ""blended retirement system"" that reduces your pension but also provides matching Thrift Savings Plan contributions. (The timing for members of the Reserves is based on the number of retirement points.)  After 2018. If you join on January 1, 2018, or later, you'll automatically be enrolled in the blended retirement system.  Take Our Quiz: Test Your Retirement IQ  How Is the System Changing?  Under the current military retirement system, you'll receive income for life if you serve for 20 years or longer. Your retirement pay, which starts right away, is based on 2.5% times the number of years you served times your retired base pay (generally calculated by averaging the highest 36 months of basic pay). This works out to be 50% of your retired base pay if you stay for 20 years, and more if you stay longer. The payouts are adjusted each year for the cost of living.  The new system changes the formula to figure retirement income as 2% times the number of years served times your retired base pay. This works out to 40% of your base pay at 20 years. (Note that both systems adjust payouts for the cost of living.)  But under the new system, you'll also get something if you leave before then. The Department of Defense will automatically contribute 1% of your basic pay to the Thrift Savings Plan after 60 days of service. It will also match your contributions up to the next 4% of your pay. That's up to 5% each year in free money that you can keep in your plan (along with the earnings) after completing two years of service.  You may also receive a cash bonus after 12 years of service, in return for a commitment of four more years of service, called ""continuation pay.""  As with any TSP contributions, the money grows tax-deferred for the future (or tax-free in a Roth TSP). In addition, you generally can't withdraw money from the TSP while you are still in the service, and will need to pay a 10% penalty for withdrawals before age 59Â½.  For more information about the new system, see the Department of Defense's Blended Retirement System Web page. You'll find information and FAQs (including special calculations for members of the Reserves) and other resources.  You'll have from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2018, to opt in. If you don't do anything, you'll remain in the current retirement system.  How Do You Choose?  If you don't plan to stay for 20 years, then you'll come out ahead with the blended retirement system. If you're not sure whether or not you'll be staying, it pays to do the math. Estimate what your monthly income is likely to be under the old and new pension system, and figure out how much you'd need to save in the TSP to make up the difference.  ""We're doing some analysis to understand the probability of retirement and if they can save enough to make up for the gap,"" says Josh Andrews, a certified financial planner and advice director for Military Life for USAA, and former Air Force pilot.  If you choose the blended system, be sure to contribute at least the 5% needed to get the full match in your Thrift Savings Plan; otherwise, you're giving up free money. Under either system, it helps if you can afford to contribute even more--the more money you contribute when you're young, the longer it has time to grow and the less you'll need to set aside later to reach the same goals.

Financial Adviser: How to help clients affected by the MPAA,"The government responded to their consultation on a reduction to the money purchase annual allowance (MPAA) on 20 March. Despite pressure from industry, the reduction is going ahead.

Before we get onto the MPAA, it is worth a resume of the â€œnormalâ€ annual allowance rules. Everyone ordinarily has an annual allowance of between Â£10,000 and Â£40,000 that covers:
* The increase in active defined benefits schemes. Broadly, 16 times the pension increase.  * Pension contributions made to a defined contribution arrangements including personal, employer and third-party contributions.  If the annual allowance is exceeded, unused allowance from the three previous tax years can be â€œcarried forwardâ€ to increase it. Where the allowance is exceeded, the excess is taxed at your marginal rate.  A scheme can be required to pay the charge out of your benefits if you have exceeded Â£40,000 in their scheme and your tax charge exceeds Â£2,000. Where the amounts are lower, the scheme can still pay voluntarily.  The origins of the MPAA  From April 2011, you could take your whole pension as a lump sum under the old flexible drawdown rules if you had secure income of Â£12,000 a year. If you did, future contributions were effectively banned as your AA became zero.  With pension freedoms, flexibility was available to all and as the intention was to allow people to work flexibly and keep saving into a pension there was a need for something new. With access to large lump sums the government had to prevent people â€recyclingâ€ their pensions purely to get further tax relief.  The new rule was the MPAA, which was initially set at Â£10,000, and Â£4,000 from 6 April 2017.  How does the MPAA work?  From the tax year that someone first flexibly accesses their pension they are subject to the MPAA. Future money purchase contributions are restricted to Â£4,000. If you exceed Â£4,000, the AA you have for defined benefits is reduced by Â£4,000.  Carry forward cannot be used. Importantly, the rules for when you can force your scheme to pay are unlikely to be usable. You need to exceed Â£40,000 and the excess alone generates a charge of Â£2,000 or more.  How do you flexibly access benefits?  There are 7 ways, known as MPAA triggers:  1. Uncrystallised funds pension lump sum (UFPLS)  This is a new type of lump sum payment introduced from April 2015 and the payment of one triggers the MPAA.  2. Flexi-access drawdown  A designation of funds for flexi-access drawdown does not in itself trigger the MPAA, nor does the payment of a PCLS. However, once income is taken, the MPAA applies from the date of the payment.  3. Capped drawdown income above cap  Those in â€œcapped drawdownâ€ on 5 April 2015 continued with the same rules in place. However, if they choose to take an income above their cap the MPAA will apply from when the income payment that breaches it is paid.  4. Existing flexible drawdown  People who had flexible drawdown funds immediately before 6 April 2015, were treated as having triggered on 6 April 2015 as their drawdown became flexi-access on this date.  5. Standalone lump sum  A standalone lump sum that is paid out after 5 April 2015 will trigger the MPAA where the reason the whole pension was paid as a lump sum was the member had primary protection and lump sum rights at A-day in excess of Â£375,000.  6. Flexible annuity  Many annuities are â€œflexibleâ€ but for MPAA purposes it is a very specific type of annuity. It is an annuity where entitlement occurred after 5 April 2015 and it varies in a way not permitted before that date. Allowable variations are in the Registered Pension Schemes (Prescribed Manner of Determining Annuities) Regulations.  7. Scheme pension (less than 12 members)  Where a client is entitled to scheme pension from a money purchase arrangement after 6 April 2015 this will trigger the MPAA unless there are 12 or more members entitled to scheme pensions .  Can you access pensions and not trigger the MPAA?  Yes.  Pension commencement lump sum (PCLS) only  Where you vest enough pension to take a lump sum to meet your needs and do not take any income.  Capped drawdown income within the cap  You can change the income amount within the cap at any time for example starting, reducing or increasing.  Defined benefits  Benefits such as PCLS and pension or trivial commutation lump sums do not trigger.  PCLS and scheme pension from a DC occupational scheme  Providing there are at least 12 members receiving a scheme pension there will be no trigger. Therefore scheme pensions from small self-administered schemes will be a trigger.  Small pots  A small pot payment made under The Registered Pension Schemes (Authorised Payments) Regulations is not a trigger.  Dependants' benefits  Taking dependants' benefits is not a trigger. This includes death benefits for non-dependants too for example, lump sums or nominees drawdown.  Standalone lump sums  These are allowed for any amount as long as they do not fit the trigger criteria above.  Lifetime annuity  An annuity that is only allowed to vary in such a way that was permitted prior to 6 April 2015 is not a trigger.  Disqualifying pension credits  Income taken from assets wholly attributable to a disqualifying pension credit, that is, pension credits from divorce pension sharing orders where the benefits were already in payment at the time of the order, is not a trigger.  So who will be impacted and what can you do?  There are two cohorts:  1. Those yet to take benefits  It will become an issue when they want to take flexible benefits but foresee continued DC savings over Â£4,000. They will need to accept the tax charge, reduce future savings plans or make alternative savings arrangements.  Planning may require the transfer of pension benefits to a scheme that will allow benefits to be taken in a way that does not trigger the MPAA. Individual circumstances will dictate if benefits can be taken in a way that does not trigger. Alternatively, perhaps non-pension savings could be used to meet their needs.  2. Those who have already triggered the MPAA  Anyone who has flexibly accessed benefits is potentially impacted if they are still contributing, or having contributions made on their behalf or by their employer and these exceed Â£4,000. A check of pension contributions against available allowances should be a part of any review process, so the reduction should be caught for those getting advice. Others will need to rely on employers/schemes informing them of the rule changes.  This will not necessarily be an issue only for high earners; relatively small salaries with good quality workplace provision could be impacted.  Some schemes will receive 18 per cent of salary between employer and employee. This would impact people on salaries from Â£22,223, a figure below the national average wage. Conversely, anyone only having auto-enrolment minima contributions paid will not trigger regardless of salary.  Like those who have yet to trigger their benefits the issues are the same, if they are already contributing, or looking to start, they will have to restrict them to Â£4,000 or pay the tax charge. Alternate savings vehicles may be needed.  Where a tax charge is payable then this will have to be declared to HMRC through self-assessment and the charge paid, it may be possible to have this collected through future PAYE coding.  Case study  Finally, it should be remembered that avoiding a MPAA charge might not be a good thing.  Let's take Bob. He earns Â£40,000 a year and his employer pays 6 per cent of this into a pension. Where Bob pays up to 6 per cent too, his employer will match it.  You can see from the table below that the amount of any MPAA charge will be under Bob's control - it will be based on how much he decides to pay.  Once the MPAA is reached:  Bob effectively receives no tax relief on each additional Â£1 he contributes, so;  â€¢ Each Â£1 of pension costs him Â£1;  â€¢ On withdrawals this Â£1, after 25 per cent tax free and 20 per cent tax, gives 85p  Ordinarily this would not be sensible.  However, while the employer is matching contributions:  â€¢ Bob's Â£1 gets him 85p.  â€¢ His employers Â£1 costs him 20p tax,  â€¢ His employers Â£1 also returns 85p, so;  â€¢ Bob's Â£1 generates Â£1.50.  So, suffering an MPAA charge makes Bob better off while his employer matches his contribution. Once the employer matching stops, the pension no longer seems worth it.

Other factors should be taken into account too: IHT position, other tax benefits like avoiding a child benefit charge or restoring some personal allowance or employers could be asked to change remuneration packages which could net benefits. The MPAA should be factored into the advice process but do not always try to avoid breaching it. Tax is only bad where the net benefit is not worth it.

EBONY HAZELEGER: The best ways to rebuild your credit,"We all know the love-hate relationship that we have when it comes to our credit cards. We love our cards when we are given the freedom to spend on necessary and at times unnecessary purchases. But then we hate our credit cards when we have to maintain the relationship by paying the monthly bills along with the interest rate and annual fees.

But not all credit relationships need to end with a bad breakup. The relationship can still continue on and become rock solid if you use your cards responsibly, stick to your payment plans and avoid needless spending. But if you find yourself down that road after a bad relationship with your credit cards, always know that rebuilding your credit score can always be achieved based upon the following:
How Long Does It Take To Rebuild Your Credit?  If you have bad or poor credit, rebuilding your credit takes time and patience because negative information remains on your credit report for seven to 10 years. It also depends on the credit relationship, the length of your credit history and the steps you take to rebuild your credit. You can't remove negative reports when it comes to your past credit card relationships. But you can show good faith to creditors if you do not go back to your old spending habits.  Which Credit Card Should I Shop For?  The best recommendation is to always get a secured credit card. Some do require security deposits upfront and are often far less expensive than unsecured credit cards for people with bad credit. And if you do some diligent research, and use your card wisely, it can generally be changed over to a regular credit card in a year or so.  Should I Keep My Old Credit Cards Open?  The longer an account is open, the better your credit score. Closing old credit cards has been known to hurt your credit score. This is because your FICO score is partially determined by the length of your credit history. If you're not using your credit cards anymore, and it doesn't carry an annual fee, put it some place safe and let it collect dust. If it does carry an annual fee, call the credit card company to see if you can downgrade to a card with no or low annual fees.  How Should You Maintain Your Credit Score?  Your credit score is calculated based upon your payment history, how much credit you have, and the length of your credit history. A good starting point is to pay your bills on time and to use your credit cards responsibly because your score will reflect these smart spending behaviors. Also, make multiple micropayments during the month to keep balances down. One important tip is to treat your credit card like a debit card where you make your monthly payments as soon as you see a purchase is posted.  How Should I Keep My Credit Utilization Low?  Utilization is the amount of your credit limit that you spend each month. For instance, if you have a $600 credit limit and spend $60 in a month, your utilization will be 10 percent. Your utilization is part of what determines your credit score. It is always advised that you should never exceed 30 percent of your credit limit. The best method is to be lower than 30 percent because the lower your utilization rate, the better your score will be. It's also recommended that you make one small purchase (like a carton of milk) each month to keep your utilization low. Doing so will help increase your credit score at a faster rate.  In summary, as long as you pay your monthly bills on time, all the time, and avoid maxing out your spending limit, your score will gradually improve. So pay your bills and use your credit cards responsibly. Your score will reflect these smart-spending habits.

"Not Just Renters: Mortgage Foreclosure Protections Expiring Too, Endangering 1.75 Million Homeowners","Foreclosure sign shown through a front gate of a foreclosed home in Oakland, California

The federal ban on evictions of renters wasnâ€™t the only pandemic-related protection allowed to expire on July 31: a federal ban on foreclosures also ended, and while several ad hoc programs will mitigate the effect for a few months, nearly 2 million Americans remain behind on their house payments.
Just days after a global pandemic was declared in March 2020, the Trump administration began offering homeowners the option of forbearance on their federally-backed mortgage payments, allowing them to reduce or defer those payments without penalty as a way to weather the financial hardships created by covid-related shutdowns and job losses.Â The program affected homes with mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and state corporations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), and at its height protected more than 11 million families.Â   However, the Biden administration said in June that its month-long refresh of the program would be its last, and as August begins, at least 1.75 million homeowners remain in forbearance, or 3.5% of all homes in the US, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) has created three new safeguards that will help mitigate or delay foreclosures for a time, but they are confined to borrowers who fell behind during the pandemic and ultimately wonâ€™t halt foreclosure altogether.  Those measures, which protect borrowers more than 120 days behind on their payments, include a loss mitigation program that can delay foreclosure; requiring loan servicers to verify that a property is considered abandoned under local and state laws before proceeding with a foreclosure; and requiring loan servicers to make a â€œreasonableâ€ effort to contact borrowers and to wait 90 days after doing so before beginning the foreclosure process.However, those protections donâ€™t go into effect until August 31, meaning some could still be kicked out of their homes in the month-long gap.  About 1.5 million of the 1.75 million in forbearance are at least 90 days behind - a number roughly equivalent to that reported in March 2021 - and at least 20% of them wonâ€™t be able to forestall foreclosure past September, according to the Washington Post.â€œThis is just more of the K-shaped recovery,â€ Diane Thompson, senior adviser to acting CFPB director Dave Uejio, told the Post. â€œThe ones who are left [in forbearance] are by and large people who arenâ€™t paying, canâ€™t pay and havenâ€™t made payments for a very long time.â€  The American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) signed into law in April 2021 provided $10 billion in a Homeowners Assistance Fund to help homeowners pay off that debt, but â€œthe program is moving so slowly that protections are expiring before states have figured out how to distribute the money,â€ the Post reported. According to the paper, by Saturday, the US Treasury hadnâ€™t even opened its portal for states to submit their distribution plans, meaning they can only access some 10% of whatâ€™s been set aside.  Budding Movement Demands Return of Eviction Ban  A similar situation has plagued the Emergency Rental Assistance Program, created by the CARES Act in December 2020 to distribute $25 billion in bailouts to renters behind on their payments. Between the December allotment and a subsequent $21.5 billion created for state and local programs in early 2021, some $46 billion was set aside to save more than 15 million American renters from eviction.  However, as Sputnik has reported, the federal eviction moratorium mandated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was also allowed to expire at the end of July without being replaced by a more concrete action, such as a federal law or executive order, and just a tiny fraction of the aid money - $3 billion in federal funds and $1.5 billion in state and local funds - has actually been paid out to struggling renters.Unlike homeowners, renters never got an equivalent pause on their rent payments, which have piled up into substantial debts over the past 18 months.People camp out on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to highlight the upcoming expiration of the pandemic-related federal moratorium on residential evictions, in Washington, U.S., July 31, 2021.  The result is that millions of Americans behind on rent payments face the immediate or impending threat of being rendered homeless, as some state eviction bans are also set to expire in the coming weeks.  With House lawmakers beginning a seven-week summer recess on Friday without replacing the eviction ban and the Senate set to join them later this week, activists have rallied to the call by Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), a progressive freshman representative, to occupy the steps of the US Capitol building until a new protection is enacted.On Tuesday afternoon, the CDC suddenly reversed course and issued a new ""targeted"" moratorium lasting until October 3, noting the order is confined to target areas with significant community spread of COVID-19, which heightens the risks associated with eviction and homelessness.  Unemployment, Student Loan Help Ending  Other pandemic protections are also being allowed to sunset, as well. Many US states have already voluntarily ended their federal unemployment benefit programs even as millions remain without jobs and new unemployment applications are once again rising. The federal program created by the ARPA was given sufficient funding to operate until September 6, but more than half of state governments had already cut theirs by early July, driven by conservative beliefs that the payments have been keeping Americans from more adamantly seeking out employment.Student loan deferment, also introduced at the start of the pandemic by the US Department of Education, allowed millions of Americans to preserve their meager incomes during lockdown periods by putting off payment of loans used to pay for their college education. The program is set to expire on September 30, 2021, but Biden hasnâ€™t yet spoken on the issue. Americans hold roughly $1.7 trillion student loan debt.  Several lawmakers have pushed the Biden administration to extend it until March 2022, and to forgive up to $50,000 per person in student loan debt. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA) appealed to Biden last week to make the move via executive action, urging that â€œfailure to act would be unconscionable, would undermine our economic recovery.â€Â ",1

House committee OKs increased cost for solar customers; Legislation would allow a charge of about $330 a year for use of electric grid,"DES MOINES â€” Legislation to allow rate-regulated utilities to charge their solar customers an infrastructure fee was approved on a party-line vote Monday by the House Commerce Committee.

Unlike most utility legislation that gets complicated, Rep. Gary Mohr, R-Bettendorf, said House Study Bill 185 is simple.
""If you use it, you pay for it,"" Mohr told the House Commerce Committee before it voted 12-10 to send the bill to the full House.  The legislation would allow rate-regulated utilities to charge solar customers about $330 a year to pay for their use of the electric grid, Mohr said. REC and municipal utility solar customers share in the infrastructure cost, he said, but customers of the rate-regulated utilities do not.  Current customers would be grandfathered in, so they would see no rate change.  However, Rep. John Forbes, D-Des Moines, said solar customers benefit utilities during peak loads. Typically, he said, peak demand is on sunny summer days at the same time solar customers are producing at a maximum. They push electrons back onto the grid at a much lower cost than utilities can buy electricity on the market â€” 3 cents versus 20 cents to 21 cents â€” during peak demand, Forbes said.  The $330 per year fee probably would discourage investment in solar power because it would extend the payback for a typical residential solar power system from eight years to 14 years or longer, Forbes said.  ""The fact the rest of us are subsidizing it is the reason why you get eight-year payback as opposed to a 14-year payback,"" Mohr countered.  He also said the 800 jobs in the Iowa solar industry is about the same number as in wind energy in 2003. Now there are about 8,000.  ""I would expect 15 years from now, solar energy will have 10 times the jobs it has today,"" he said.  A similar bill, Senate Study Bill 1201, is under consideration by the Senate Commerce Committee.  l Comments: (319) 398-8375; james.lynch@thegazette.com",1

Majority Of Americans Put Priority On Retirement Savings But Few Know About
Potential Changes To Ira
","
BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 2, 1996--With the New Year about to begin and
the anticipated arrival of big credit card bills from Holiday spending sprees,
many people are starting to take a look at their current and long-term savings
situation.



But it seems that the picture may not be complete for a large group of
Americans.

 In a survey conducted for Fidelity Investments by ICR Survey Research Group, nine out of 10 respondents said saving for retirement is an important financial goal for 1996.  In the same survey, however, only three in 10 participants were aware of pending legislation that would substantially enhance Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), a primary vehicle for retirement savings.    ""It's ironic that while everyone seems to place a high priority on saving for retirement, so few Americans are aware of the broad impact the proposed changes to IRAs could have on their retirement savings options,"" said Kathryn A. Hopkins, executive vice president of retail marketing, Fidelity Investments.  ""These are actually the most significant changes to the IRA since the Tax Reform Act of 1986. We anticipate that if the legislation is passed, IRAs could become much more attractive to a wide variety of Americans.""    According to Hopkins, major elements of the proposed changes to current IRA tax laws include:    o Allow everyone not covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan to make a tax deductible contribution to a regular IRA, regardless of income.  Unlike today, this would allow non-wage-earning spouses, as well as workers without pension coverage but whose spouses are covered by a pension plan, to make tax-deductible IRA contributions.    o For persons covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans, raise the income limits for making fully tax deductible contributions to their regular IRA.  These income limits would gradually rise over the next decade from $40,000 to $100,000 for couples and from $25,000 to $85,000 for individuals.    o Establish a new type of IRA -- The American Dream IRA -- available to all Americans.  This would eliminate income tax on all distributions made after 591/2, or on account of death or disability if this account has been in effect for at least five years, but would not provide a tax deduction at the time of contribution.  ""Special Purpose Distributions""  after five years would also be tax-free for: first time-home purchases, higher education expenses, catastrophic medical expenses or long-term unemployment.    o Also allow ""Special Purpose Distributions""  from both the regular IRA and the American Dream IRA without the normal 10 percent penalty.    o Allow any couple, even if one did not earn wages outside the home, to each make up to a $2,000 annual contribution to either a regular IRA or American Dream IRA for a total of $4,000 per tax year.  This is up from the previous limit of $2,250 per couple.    Sponsored by Fidelity Investments, a leading financial services company, the survey was conducted by ICR Survey Research Group December 21, 22 and 23 and included interviews with 794 Americans, 1/2 male and 1/2 female.  Sample households were selected based on single-stage random-dialing methodology. The data have been weighted to provide nationally representative projectionable estimate of the adult population 18 years of age or older.    ICR Survey Research Group of Media, PA, a division of AUS Consultants, is a full service multi-disciplined market research firm.  In addition to full-service custom research, ICR also conducts the largest weekly telephone omnibus survey in the industry, EXCEL. EXCEL is used frequently by the media to measure public opinion on important national issues and also provides brand share and concept testing information to a variety of companies in the advertising, entertainment, financial and packaged goods industries.    Fidelity Investments, with total customer assets of $520.6 billion as of November 30, 1995, is one of the country's leading providers of financial services.

"GOP health plan will offer less coverage; Insurance executives predict lower premiums, but higher deductibles","MILWAUKEE - Supporters contend that the American Health Care Act proposed by Republicans overall would lower the cost of health insurance sold directly to individuals and families.

They usually don't mention the reason: The health plans on average would have higher deductibles and provide less coverage.
That's partly how five executives with health insurance companies â€” four based in Wisconsin and one that does business in the state â€” see the market for insurance eventually evolving under the proposed Republican plan.  ""There's this promise that insurance is going to be less expensive,"" said Cathy Mahaffey, chief executive officer of Common Ground Healthcare Cooperative in Brookfield. ""How is that going to be accomplished?""  Insurance companies will lower premiums, she said, by providing less coverage.  ""That's the method we always have used,"" Mahaffey said.  The cost would be less because people will be buying less insurance, and that's not the same as lowering the actual cost of insurance, she said.  ""If we want to reduce the cost of insurance,"" she said, ""we've got to start talking about the cost of medical care.""  The proposed Republican plan also could lower premiums because fewer older people, who have higher medical bills, would buy health insurance, the insurers said.  The plan would allow health insurers to charge older people up to five times more than younger people as opposed to the current cap of three times under the Affordable Care Act.  The higher cap is in line with the actual cost of insuring people who are 55 and older, said Rob Plesha, an actuary and vice president who oversees the small group and individual markets for Quartz Health Solutions, which manages Gundersen Health Plan and Unity Health Insurance, in Sauk City.  However, the Republican plan also would provide tax credits tied to a person's age and not the cost of insurance. The tax credits â€” $3,500 for people 50 to 59; $4,000 for people 60 and older â€” would not offset the increase in premiums.  As it now stands, the cost of insurance would jump for older people â€” and, as a result, fewer of them would buy insurance.  ""The age composition (of the plans) changes dramatically,"" said Marty Anderson, chief marketing officer of Security Health Plan in Marshfield.  However, an amendment was added Monday night that featured an unusual approach: language paving the way for the Senate, if it chooses, to make the bill's tax credit more generous for people age 50-64. Details in the documents released were initially unclear, but one GOP lawmaker and an aide said the plan sets aside $85 billion over 10 years for that purpose.  About 57 percent of the people who have bought health plans from Security Health are over 50 â€” in part because the health plan's market is largely rural and has an older population.  The Congressional Budget Office last week estimated that the cost of health insurance for someone 64 would increase 20 percent to 25 percent by 2026 â€” and Anderson believes the increase could be even higher if older people didn't leave the market.  That could happen.  ""There are sick people who will go to great lengths to buy insurance,"" said J. Mario Molina, a physician and president and chief executive of Molina Healthcare.  The Congressional Budget Office's report released last week also found that premiums would be lower under the Republican plan because health plans would provide less coverage and because fewer older people would have insurance.  All this, though, is in flux.  The House is making changes to the initial plan, and the Senate is expected to do the same.  President Donald Trump conducted closed-door meetings with Republican legislators Tuesday, trying to win enough support for the House to approve the bill on Thursday.  ""This is our long-awaited chance to finally get rid of Obamacare,"" Trump said at a rally in Louisville, Ky., Monday night. ""We're going to do it.""  Parts of the Republican plan â€” particularly enabling health insurers to offer lower-cost health plans that hold more appeal to healthy people â€” are needed to stabilize the market, several insurance executives said.  ""We currently are in an unstable market,"" said Coreen Dicus-Johnson, president and chief executive of Network Health in Menesha.  As a generalization, younger people who are healthy care more about premiums and are more open to buying health plans that cover only major medical expenses than older people.  ""It's not a one-size fits all in health insurance,"" said Mahaffey, of Common Ground Healthcare. ""It's just not.""  The Affordable Care Act forces younger people to buy more insurance than they may want or need, effectively subsidizing the cost of insuring older people. As a result, too few young people bought insurance.  That doesn't make for a stable market, said Plesha, of Quartz Health Solutions.  The challenge is finding a way to get more healthy people to buy health insurance while ensuring that older people won't be forced out of the market.  How the Republican plan â€” at least in its current form â€” would do that isn't clear.  The Republican plan also would end the additional subsidies that are available to people with low incomes â€” such as someone making less than $11.50 an hour, or $24,000 a year â€” to offset deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses.  People in that income group are the most likely to lose their health insurance because the tax credits under the Republican replacement plan are less than they receive under the Affordable Care Act.  That said, money included in the Republican plan to help stabilize rates could help lower costs for people who are older or who have very low incomes.  ""It all depends how that program is structured,"" said Anderson, of Security Health.  States would decide how to use the money, and how the plan would work isn't clear.  What is clear is the proposed plan would bring widespread changes to the market for health insurance sold directly to individuals and families. But how the changes will play out is anyone's guess.  ""It is not clear that these changes will stabilize the market,"" said Dicus-Johnson, of Network Health. ""There still are a lot of questions.""  However, she and the other executives believe that fewer people â€” particularly older people â€” will have health insurance under the Republican plan.  ""And that's a problem,"" Dicus-Johnson said.

Council wonâ€™t accept that my 43-year-old son doesnâ€™t live here,"I have come to the end of my tether trying to get Glasgow city council to accept that I live alone and am entitled to the single personâ€™s council tax rebate.

I have lived alone since my wife died in March 2015. Everything was fine until mid-2019, when, without warning (as I believe is required under the direct debiting scheme) the council increased my monthly debit by Â£21. When I queried this I was told that it was because my son had moved in with me. The council tells me that unless I tell it when he moved out (difficult, as he never moved in) and provide a forwarding address (again difficult as I have no idea where he lives) then it assumes he is living with me.
I will be delighted and surprised if you can get anywhere.  Jill replies  You believe that your son has been sofa surfing â€” moving from one friendâ€™s house to another on an unofficial and temporary basis. You told me you have told him on numerous occasions that he was welcome to move in with you â€œbut he says that he is OK and is clean and tidy so obviously is. He is 43 and seems to be perfectly independentâ€.  Your son insisted that he has never told anyone that he lives at your address, but he did provide it to an employer as where his payslips should be sent and has also used it to obtain credit.  I told Glasgow council that you were unlikely to risk your job as a motor litigation consultant for a very well-known insurance company for the sake of saving a few hundred pounds a year through a fraudulent claim. I asked it to reconsider your claim for the single person discount and asked what evidence it needed to prove that your son does not live with you. You also invited the council to send inspectors.  Glasgow council told me that your single person discount was withdrawn in March 2019 and that its decision remained unchanged. You were apparently offered the option of going to the Valuation Appeal Committee but you have not pursued that.  The council tax office accepted your home as being your sonâ€™s main residence in the absence of any other address details and added that you do not need to be permanently resident at an address for it to be deemed a main residence for council tax purposes. However, it took on board my comments and a single person discount has been applied â€œfrom the 2021-22 financial year, on the understanding an inspection may be arranged over the coming weeksâ€. This will save you about Â£250 a year.  You are still insulted that staff did not believe you when you said your son has never lived with you, and we both think that if it is prepared to allow you the discount now, it should backdate it for two years. You said: â€œI understand that people do try to fiddle the council but this should not blind it to the fact that there are decent, honest people, and the default position should not be that all people are cheats unless they can prove theyâ€™re not. This is not about the money â€” I take this very personally.â€  But the council is adamant. For your discount to be backdated to March 2019 you or you son must provide evidence of where he is living.  Â£54 for eco radiator valves? That smarts . . .  I am having problems with the British Gas subsidiary Hive, which is struggling to deliver on its promises of a â€œsmart homeâ€ with regard to its thermostatic radiator valves (TRVs).  This smart valve allows you to control each individual radiator when fitted, which is brilliant because weâ€™re all working from home and donâ€™t want to heat rooms weâ€™re not in. It should in theory mean good savings on gas bills and help to reduce waste.  I have eight of the valves and have had issues with them repeatedly calibrating, which means they turn the heating on and off over four hours to work out the radiator temperature. This happens pretty much all the time with one of my valves, which means the heating comes on at random times 24 hours a day.  This means my boiler is on a lot, my bills are higher than they should be, and the TRVs are Â£54 each, so trying to have a smart home has cost me money rather than saving it.  Now one of the valves has â€œbrickedâ€ and is out of warranty due to a technical failure â€” itâ€™s 18 months old, which I donâ€™t think is ancient by any stretch. Hive isnâ€™t budging and seems to accept that this is normal for its devices. There are countless complaints about this piece of equipment. In theory Hiveâ€™s technology should be amazing. In reality, it seems to have been rushed out before it was ready. Iâ€™m resigned to buying another valve and living with the issues now I am locked in to the technology.  Jill replies  I asked Hive to either fix or replace your faulty valves, or to refund you their full cost. You were contacted by a senior support engineer, who spent a long time on the phone with you, helping you to remove and test every single thermostat. Hive also replaced the defective thermostat as a goodwill gesture.  You said: â€œFinally things seem to be working as they should. Thank you so much for helping exert this pressure on them. Without you I would have had to remove the system in its entirety.â€  Feeling the pinch  I bought a Tempur Hybrid Elite 25 mattress from John Lewis online on February 16 for Â£1,657, price-matched to Â£1,449, to replace my old mattress that had developed a manufacturerâ€™s fault which was aggravating my hip condition.  I was unable to go to the Newcastle store because we were in lockdown so I had to buy online without trying. I applied my own waterproof covering and the new mattress initially seemed OK, but after a week my hip condition has been greatly aggravated, my mobility reduced and pain increased. I was being woken at 3am and having to pace around the house until morning. The mattress is just too soft and doesnâ€™t provide the support my condition needs.  I contacted the John Lewis aftercare team on February 23 and was told that as it was a comfort issue and the packaging has been removed, the Tempur could not be returned or exchanged. I could maybe appreciate that when it is possible to visit the store that this may seem reasonable, but in the present situation it seems anything but.  I put the mattress on eBay for Â£879. After finding a buyer I returned to the John Lewis website on April 17 to check the weight of the mattress for the courier. This is when I discovered that John Lewis is now offering a 40-day trial for exchange/refund of the exact mattress. I again contacted John Lewis aftercare but was told that because the trial policy had started on March 29 I could not return the mattress.  I am disabled and on a fixed income, and the Tempur mattress was intended as an investment in my health and an attempt to reduce my pain. It cost a lot of money and I am disappointed in the level of aftercare. This in no way detracts from the excellent customer care I have received from the sales and delivery staff.  Jill replies  You cancelled your eBay sale because you believed you would now be able to return the mattress to John Lewis. This is a shame: although the John Lewis staff member who said the mattress could not be returned because the packaging had been disposed of was incorrect, Iâ€™m afraid you still cannot return it.  Online purchases can normally be returned under the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, provided that you notify the retailer of your intention within 14 days of receiving the goods. But certain items are exempt from this rule for hygiene reasons, and mattresses fall into this group. Retailers can waive the exemption, hence the proliferation of companies offering 100-day trials for mattresses in a box, but it is their choice. John Lewis says clearly that it will not exchange or refund mattresses unless they are subject to a supplier promotion.  John Lewis said the 40-day trial is being offered by Tempur. It asked Tempur if it would extend the offer to you but it refused.  However, John Lewis recognised that this has been a poor experience for you and has offered you a Â£200 voucher in apology. You have accepted and will be selling the mattress on eBay again.  Can we help you?

the market   ,"My wife and I own the freehold of a quite large building. The whole ground floor serves as our business (a dental surgery) and is accessed from the front. We live above in a self-contained, three-bedroom flat with access via an external staircase at the rear. We would like to move to enable our three children to have the pleasures of a garden and a bedroom each but would like to keep the flat to let, though finances might dictate otherwise. If we sell the flat, how do I split the building with regard to flat /business? Do I sell the building freehold and give ourselves a long lease? I have heard that lenders are not keen on freehold flats, is this true? Do we sell the flat leasehold? I am also totally ignorant about leasehold law and wonder what responsibilities I am left with in respect of maintenance, roof, floors, etc if I am still the freehold owner?   
 Lorna Vestey writes: Whether you decide to keep, to share or to sell the freehold, if you want to split the ownership of the building you will need to have leases drawn up by a property solicitor for both the flat and the commercial element (your dental surgery). The leases will contain provision for dealing with the costs of maintaining and insuring the structure and exterior fabric of the building, which will be split on a stipulated percentage basis (often calculated on comparative square footage/meterage). The freeholder will be responsible for arranging for appropriate maintenance and insurance. Internal repairs and decorations will be the responsibility of the leaseholder concerned. I recommend that you discuss the draft leases with a local firm of surveyors which deals with both residential and commercial properties (find one through recommendation or the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (  www.ricsfirms.com  , 0870 333 1600). This is because there may be extra matters to consider. For example, if there is roof space which might be suitable for conversion, you could include it in the domain of the existing flat but you might want to keep it, either to create another smaller flat yourselves (subject to the necessary permissions) or to sell it separately. You would need to make provision for access and make sure that this would all be possible under the lease granted on the existing flat. Personally, I would sell the flat on a long lease (say, 105 years) and keep the freehold, just to retain that extra element of control and for any future development potential. Alternatively, you could put the freehold into the ownership of a company in which both leaseholders were equal shareholders. You would sell the flat on a lease but with a share of the freehold. However, I would not expect the value to be much enhanced and a freehold shared between two parties can result in tiresome disagreements with no majority vote possible. The third option would be to sell the freehold of the building with the lease of the flat. Discuss all this with your local surveyors and obtain their advice too.

Credit rating fix could hurt consumers   ,"Credit repair companies are taking advantage of a loophole in the calculation of credit scores, and fixing the problem will hurt consumers â€” particularly those just establishing credit.   

The practice, called ""piggybacking,"" has been used for years by consumers with good credit to help relatives or friends establish or improve their credit rating. Parents with good credit, for instance, can authorize a child to use their credit card and that act will boost the youngster's fledgling credit score.   
Credit repair agencies are paying consumers with high credit scores to authorize its poor-scoring clients to piggyback on the solid accounts. The clients pay $800 to $900 to boost their score, said Oklahoma City attorney Eric Johnson. The participants with good credit can earn several hundred dollars for each person they authorize on a credit card.     A recent Associated Press story related how a Florida real estate agent paid $1,800 to be added as an authorized user on several credit card accounts with pristine credit. Alipio Estruch's credit score jumped from a 550 to 715 in about a month, and he secured a 7.5 percent mortgage rate to buy a $449,000 home.     Johnson, of the Phillips McFall law firm, represents a local mortgage lender and an auto lender, each of which was misled by customers' inflated credit scores. The customers later defaulted on loans granted because the credit scores were hiked through the piggybacking loophole, Johnson said.     ""I see it as mortgage fraud or outright fraud,"" Johnson said.     Scores of credit enhancement Web sites offer the service for a fee, Johnson said. Federal regulators could enforce existing laws to prevent the practice, Johnson said, but appear unwilling to try.     ""The FTC (Federal Trade Commission) looked at this and said 'We can't say this is illegal or is legal,'"" Johnson said. ""There are your tax dollars at work.""     The impact of the relatively new procedure likely will spread to insurance companies, which use credit scores to set rates, and businesses, which often purchase credit scores of potential employees during the hiring process, Johnson said.     Fair Isaac, the company that created the proprietary formula that determines credit scores, will close the loophole later this year in its calculation of FICO scores for at least one of the three credit reporting agencies. The other two credit reporting agencies should adopt the new scoring within a year, Fair Isaac said.     ""We will continue working with lenders, regulators and others in the credit reporting industry to end deceptive practices that fraudulently misrepresent consumer credit histories for profit,"" said Mark Greene, chief executive officer of Fair Isaac.     The adjustment removes authorized user accounts from consideration by the scoring model in FICO 08, the newest version of the credit score that Fair Isaac expects to become available to lenders starting in September.     Meanwhile, lenders will have to spend more time, effort and money to evaluate potential customers, Johnson said.     ""The whole credit industry now revolves around ability to take a look at that FICO score and make a decision on an interest rate or monthly payments based on that one score,"" Johnson said. ""If you can't rely on the FICO score, then you must go back to a manual scoring system.""     ""It's really bad stuff,"" Johnson said. ""Hopefully, we'll see it corrected and turned around, but it's not taking place quickly enough.""     Unfortunately, Fair Issac's new policy will shut down a method of building a credit history and score that has been used by consumers for years. And there are a lot more children, spouses or friends who will be affected than there are people who are manipulating the system, Fair Isaac said.     Don Mecoy: 475-3942, DMecoy@Oklahoman.com   ",1
Diversifying assets to help manage risk,"Strategic Asset Allocation provides a framework within which investors can target an expected return for a given level of risk. It is one of the most important, but one of the most overlooked aspects of wealth management. Strategic Asset Allocation ranks among the most important of investment decisions as studies show that it accounts for up to 90 per cent of long term investing returns.

Strategic Asset Allocation (SAA) is the process of allocating funds between asset classes to optimise investors' return objectives and risk tolerance with long-run capital market expectations. The essence of SAA is diversification. By spreading your investments across different types of securities you not only reduce the risk of your portfolio losing money, you also increase the chance that it will make money.
One of the key principles of diversification is the 'risk-return trade-off' - that is, the greater the returns, the greater the risk you take; and vice versa. One of the most important decisions you will make is how much to allocate between the asset classes as your choice will fundamentally determine the long-term investment returns and fluctuations (volatility) of your portfolio.  A dilemma every investor faces is that it is difficult to predict future performances of each asset class. Therefore, diversification of your investment portfolio across all asset classes allows you to 'hedge your bets'. By investing in different assets you are able to minimise to some degree the losses that may occur in one asset sector with gains in another.  Your allocation to shares should be higher if you plan to stay invested in those shares for an extended time. The longer your time horizon, the more likely it is shares will outperform fixed interest. However, you must still be comfortable with the high risk level associated with a portfolio with a large allocation to shares.  Investors with a shorter time horizon should focus on cash and fixed interest. For example, while the long term return from shares is around 8 - 12pc, the return in any given year could be anything from minus 30pc to plus 50pc. However, the volatility of expected returns falls as the holding period increases, and the return over many years should be closer to the 8 - 12pc figure.  One important factor in the asset allocation decision is whether you are near the end of your working life, because you can no longer count on salary income to sustain you should the share market have a period of negative returns.",1
Top Tax Benefits of Home Ownership,"MoneyTips
Your home is your castle, and it is also a source of tax deductions. Yet, every year, Americans let these potential tax deductions pass by, not realizing how to take advantage of them.IRS Publication 530, titled ""Tax Information for Homeowners"", can fill you in on the deductions that are available to you for the 2016 tax year. Several of the most important tax benefits are listed below.Mortgage Interest - This should be the largest home-related tax deduction that is available to you unless you purchased your home in the 2016 tax year. You can deduct interest payments on either primary or secondary homes, up to the limit of $1 million in collective mortgage debt if married and filing jointly. The limits are $500,000 for single filers or married couples filing separately.The mortgage interest deduction applies to anything that meets the definition of a basic living space that you own. Condominiums, mobile homes, and even boats are included assuming that they meet the living space definition with at least one sleeping area, a kitchen, and a toilet. Details may be found in IRS Publication 936, ""Home Mortgage Interest Deduction.""Points - Any points that you paid at closing to lower the interest rate on your mortgage are deductible. Generally, the deductions must be amortized over the life of the mortgage, but there are circumstances where you may be able to deduct the entire amount of your points paid in the year of purchase. See Publication 530 for details.Property Taxes - You can deduct real estate taxes that are assessed uniformly (no taxes that reflect a special privilege or a service granted to you). Property taxes associated with the purchase of a home may also be deducted.Mortgage Interest Credit - Typically, mortgage interest is taken as a deduction. However, if you have a qualifying low income, you can claim mortgage interest as a credit instead. This subtracts the total directly from your tax bill instead of from your taxable income used to determine your tax bill. To claim this credit, you must have received a qualified Mortgage Credit Certificate from a suitable state or local agency. File Form 8396 along with your tax form to claim your credit.Home Equity Loans - When you borrow against your home equity, either with a loan or a line of credit (HELOC), the interest may be deductible depending on how the loan is used, the amount of the loan, and the value of your home.Forgiven Mortgage Debt - When a bank decides to accept a short sale for less than the value of a home and forgives the rest of the debt, that debt is usually considered as taxable income. In 2007, Congress created the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act to reclassify the forgiven debt as non-taxable income, saving already distressed homeowners from a huge tax burden. After being renewed several times, this tax relief measure expired at the end of 2016 and has not been renewed by Congress. However, the good news is that if you're in the process of discharging mortgage debt and signed a written agreement with the lender in 2016, you're still eligible for this tax exemption when you file your 2016 return. What's no longer covered is any mortgage debt cancelled in 2017 or beyond. Check the IRS publications and see if any of these valuable deductions apply to you. Take advantage of every tax deduction that you can. Otherwise, the government simply keeps more of your money.Get fast, easy, and FREE tax filing for simple returns with TaxAct!Photo Â©iStockphoto.com/Pgiam  Originally Posted at: https://www.moneytips.com/top-tax-benefits-of-home-ownership  Understanding the Tax Benefits of a Mortgage  Men Benefit More from Mortgage Interest Tax Deductions  Deduct Your Mortgage Interest To Save On Taxes",1
Numbers obscure long term woes,"On April 28, the Social Security Board of Trustees released its latest report on Social Security finances. Although the program's finances improved ever so slightly from last year, the long-term condition of the retirement system remains unsound.

To keep long-term revenues and expenditures in balance would require an immediate increase of 2.19 percent in the payroll tax rate. If no action is taken, Social Security will begin to run a cash deficit in about 2012, meaning that current revenues will be insufficient to pay current benefits. By 2032, the trust fund's assets will be exhausted, and at the end of the 75-year estimating period, the system will be running a deficit equal to 2.2 percent of gross domestic product.
As bleak as the Social Security retirement system's prospects are, however, they are positively brilliant compared to the future of Medicare. The trustees' report on Medicare's condition indicates that the hospital-insurance portion of that system will be completely bankrupt as soon as the year 2008. The hospital-insurance tax will have to rise from the present 2.9 percent to 7.8 percent by 2070 to keep the system in balance.  In short, unless there are fundamental changes to both the Social Security and Medicare systems, very large tax increases are in store for future workers. A new study by economists Jagadeesh Gokhale, Benjamin Page and John Sturrock, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, quantifies the impact. As the figure shows, currently living workers can expect to pay about 30 percent of their lifetime income in net taxes. But future generations can expect to pay two-thirds more, almost 50 percent.  The term net taxes takes account of both taxes paid and benefits received. For example, a worker born in 1950 can expect to pay 43 percent of his or her lifetime income in taxes and receive 9.5 percent of it back in the form of Social Security and other government benefits, for a net lifetime tax rate of 33.4 percent. The decline in the net tax rate for workers born in recent years is entirely due to the assumption of longer lifespans and hence greater future medical benefits for those workers. Future workers, however, will have to bear those costs.  As bad as it looks for future workers, there is at least some reason for optimism. The improved budgetary situation has led to a reduction in the lifetime net tax rate on future generations of more than 35 percent since the last time the figure was calculated in 1994. At that time, the net tax burden on future workers was estimated at an astonishing 84.4 percent.

A solution to housing issue,"I notice about the Welsh Government enabling authorities to increase council tax premium on second homes to tackle the impact on communities. I cannot help wondering if a different approach is required. When selling a house it is rare the seller is obliged to accept any particular offer, a seller may choose to offer the property to a local buyer rather than to someone wishing to purchase a property as a holiday home. The Government policy seems aimed at providing local people with access to homes they can afford to buy. Perhaps sellers should be subject to a windfall tax where a home is sold to someone outside the local community at a price higher than is affordable to the local buyer. The revenue raised could be reinvested by Government in building affordable homes for local people made subject to a rule regarding future resale only to a member of the local community.
 Whilst it would not prevent an increase in the amount of housing stock being sold as holiday homes it would go some way to ensuring there remained property available for local people. David Breeze, Telford",1

Water savings loophole could cost ratepayers millions,"Ratepayers could be forced to cover more than $3 million a year in lost council revenue due to a loophole in a State Government plan to slash water bills for retirement village residents, the Local Government Association says.

The association is calling on state parliament to scrap proposed legislative changes that could lower water bills for residents in retirement villages and instead negotiate a deal with SA Water to achieve the same outcome.
The way retirement village residents are charged for water differs from organisation to organisation.  Some villages receive a single, overall supply charge and water use bill for the entire estate and divide it equally between its residents. Residents in other villages are each slugged separate supply charges and water use bills, resulting in higher individual costs.  Under proposed changes to the Local Government and Valuation of Land Acts, homes within retirement villages would no longer be assessed individually by the Valuer General and instead each village would have a single valuation number.  This would mean that SA Water could no longer charge tenants individual water bills.  The South Australian Retirement Villages Residents Association supports the abolishment of individual assessments because it argues that villages should be treated the same as apartment blocks and shopping centres, which are charged for one or two meters and receive an overall bill.  However, councils have raised concerns that the new assessment structure could also remove their ability to levy separate fixed rate charges against individual dwellings in villages.  A parliamentary inquiry has been established to investigate the proposed amendments.  In a submission to the inquiry, LGA President Sam Telfer said the planned changes would leave councils short-changed by more than $2 million.  â€œTo ensure the continued delivery of services in line with current expectations, councils would need to recover these significant shortfalls from all other ratepayers,â€ he said.  â€œThis has the impact of benefiting a few to the detriment of the many.  â€œIt is considered that issues associated with SA Water invoicing practices would be best managed directly with SA Water, rather than through a legislative change with a broader range of consequences.â€  Onkaparinga Mayor Erin Thompson also lodged a submission to the inquiry, saying the changes could cost her council $2.8 million a year.  She said the council would need to raise rates or cut services to cover the shortfall.  Adelaide Hills Council also opposed the proposed changes, saying it would be out of pocket by about $200,000 a year.  â€œFor a council of our size, this is a significant financial impact,â€ the councilâ€™s corporate services director Terry Crackett said.  Mount Gambier Council said the planned changes could cost it $261,000 each year.  Inquiry chair and Waite MP Sam Duluk said the submissions would be considered by the parliamentary committee before it handed down its recommendations by the end of the year.",1
'Tension' as pension cuts divide the generations: Fears Osborne's reshaping of tax benefits could lead to strain between workers and those who are retired,"* Workers realise they are losing out to retired people, financial experts warn

* George Osborne considering radical changes to tax benefits on pensions
* Workers will â€˜lose outâ€™ under plans to cut amount of tax relief on pensions  Changes to pensions risk â€˜inflaming inter-generation tensionsâ€™ as workers realise they are losing out to retired people, financial experts have warned.  The Chancellor George Osborne is considering radical changes to tax benefits on pensions which are expected to hit middle-class savers hardest.  But workers in their 40s or younger will also â€˜lose outâ€™ if he goes ahead with plans to cut the amount of tax relief the government gives on pension savings, financial services provider Hargreaves Lansdown said.  It warned that todayâ€™s workers are already set to receive around a third less in retirement than current pensioners and any changes would worsen the generational wealth divide.  The average private pension wealth held by those aged around 60 is about Â£149,300, but those now in their 40s will only have around Â£112,000 when they reach the same age, it said.  Tom McPhail, head of Retirement Policy, said government financial support for retirement needed to remain equal for all generations or it would risk â€˜exacerbating the inequalities which already existâ€™ between old and young.  He added: â€˜Todayâ€™s pensioners have worked hard and are now enjoying the fruits of their labours; no one would seek to deny them that.  â€˜However we are deeply concerned that the younger workers of today face an uphill battle to achieve the same levels of retirement prosperity.  â€˜Younger workers look with understandable envy at the generous guaranteed pensions enjoyed by many of todayâ€™s retirees.  â€˜By contrast, workers in their 20s, 30s and 40s today can look forward to later retirement, lower contributions and fewer guarantees.  â€˜Any reduction to the support given by the government to pension savers risks inflaming intergeneration tension.â€™  Currently, basic rate taxpayers receive a Â£2 top-up of tax relief from the Government for every Â£8 they save into a pension, while higher rate taxpayers â€“ those earning more than Â£42,385 - receive Â£4 for every Â£6 saved.  The Government is considering plans to replace this system with one where all savers receive the same top-up â€“ possibly around Â£2.50 for every Â£7.50 saved â€“ regardless of how much they earn. It may also scrap the system all together and allow pensions to be drawn tax-free in retirement instead, like an ISA.  Research carried out for the Mail by pensions provider Fidelity found a middle class worker now in their 40s stands to lose between Â£44,000 and Â£110,000 by the age of 65 if Mr Osborne limits the tax relief paid on pensions.  The same worker would miss out on as much as Â£175,000 from their total pot if he scraps it altogether and treats pensions like ISAs instead.  Research by Royal London, a pensions provider, published today revealed a flat rate of tax relief at 25 per cent would be worth just Â£2 per week extra to basic rate taxpayers but could deter middle income workers from saving altogether.  Former Pensions Minister Steve Webb, who now works for the firm, said tinkering with pension tax relief amounted to â€˜daylight robberyâ€™.  He added: â€˜A pension ISA steals billions of pounds in tax revenues from the next generation who will need the money to fund the public services of an ageing society.  â€˜And if the Chancellor opts for a low flat-rate of tax relief, he will be stealing billions of pounds today from the support we give to hard-pressed savers.â€™  He warned last week that the Chancellor was also considering scrapping the tax free lump sum, in a move which would raise Â£4billion for the Treasury but affect millions of savers.",1

Immediate Annuities
Some dream of spending their golden years in exotic locations, indulging in exciting trips to ancient ruins and sampling spicy, local cuisine. But when it comes to retirement savings, even the most adventurous seniors may still consider something routinely described as ""plain vanilla"": a fixed immediate annuity.  Perhaps the simplest of all the annuity options, a fixed immediate annuity does what its name suggests. It begins delivering steady income shortly after an investor buys a contract, often within 30 days and always within 13 months. A variable immediate annuity also delivers income quickly but, unlike with fixed annuities, your payments will fluctuate.  An immediate annuity is a contract between an investor and an insurance company, with the investor paying the insurance company a lump sum in exchange for regular income payments. Those income payments may be paid monthly, quarterly, semiannually or annually and are generally guaranteed to last as long as the contract holder is alive-or, depending on the terms of the contract, for a set period of time such as 10 or 20 years.  Fixed Immediate Annuities  Fixed immediate annuities have guarantees that can offer comfort to retirees who worry about the risks of keeping their money in financial markets. When you buy a fixed immediate annuity contract, you are guaranteeing that your monthly (or other periodic) income payments will remain the same, regardless of market conditions, for the time period specified in the contract.  The drawback of such a guarantee for fixed immediate annuities is that it won't bring big bucks. Fixed immediate annuity payments typically trail the returns that investors would see on equity and bond portfolios during a bull market.  Thus, the tradeoff for predictability might be lower returns when compared to what your money might have generated had you invested in the markets.  Another drawback to fixed immediate annuities is that, as time passes, a retiree with an annuity that offers a fixed payment amount may find that their regular payments don't stretch as far as they once did due to inflation. Annuity buyers can sometimes purchase riders with the contract that feature cost-of-living increases or fixed increases to soften the blow of inflation but, as with other riders, this will increase the cost of the annuity and may lower your overall returns.  Investors should evaluate their risk appetite when considering fixed immediate annuities. Retirees with a high risk tolerance and the ability to absorb risk may be turned off by fixed immediate annuities' conservative returns, but those with low risk tolerance and a wariness of market volatility may feel differently.  Variable Alternatives  Investors who want to receive annuity payments immediately along with the possibility of higher returns might want to consider variable immediate annuities. Variable immediate annuities, like other variable annuities, allow you to allocate your principal into a wide array of underlying investments, including stocks, mutual funds and bonds. Your allocations typically aren't set in stone, allowing you to move money out of one underlying investment and into another.  Unlike fixed immediate annuities, the value of your variable immediate annuity-and the payments you ultimately receive-will fluctuate based on how your underlying investments perform, meaning that investors have the potential to reap rewards if their investments grow but could also lose money if their investments flounder. As such, variable immediate annuities are considerably riskier than their fixed counterparts.  The Benefits of Living Longer  In general, those who may benefit most from immediate annuities are healthy people who expect to live longer-than-average lives. If your life were to be unexpectedly cut short, you would have received relatively little in annuity payments. And, unless your contract includes a death benefit or you have purchased certain riders, your surviving spouse or your heirs would not be entitled to any payments under a standard contract guaranteeing lifetime payments.  To mitigate the financial implications of dying earlier than expected, when purchasing an immediate annuity contract, you can generally purchase a rider to allow a beneficiary to receive some money from the annuity after your death. For example, some immediate annuities offer a period certain benefit, which guarantees that some amount of payments will be made to a beneficiary for a certain period of time after the contract holder dies. But a contract with this rider-or with any other sort of death benefit-will cost more. That means it will require a higher lump sum payment at the outset for the same amount of annuity income.  Investors considering immediate annuities should do their research and shop around because insurance companies may offer different features in exchange for the same lump sum payment.  And with all annuities, investors should remember that the annuity is only guaranteed as long as the insurance company issuing it remains in business, so you'll want to be sure you are comfortable with the issuer, not just the product itself.  * Original Link  Disclaimer  FINRA - Financial Industry Regulatory Authority Inc. published this content on 14 July 2022 and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

Your Money: Q&A   ,"YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED   

Q MY company have recently changed provider for their Group Personal Pension Scheme. I know that I have to transfer any future contributions to the new scheme, but can I leave my existing fund as it is, or do I have to transfer that as well?   
A NO - you are allowed to have more than one pension plan. However, I would check with your employers for the reason behind the transfer as it may highlight an issue that you are unaware of. If you are unsure what to do with your existing fund, speak to a financial adviser. For a free guide call 0800 544644.     Q I AMinterested in taking out protection against death and critical illness, but am not sure whether to take out a combined policy or two separate ones. What would you recommend?     A THE main consideration is the amount you can afford to spend. A combined policy is cheaper but will pay out once, so if you suffer a critical illness then you will not be covered for death, whereas with separate policies there are no such restrictions. Should you require further advice speak with a financial adviser. For further information please call 0800 544644.     Q IAMinterested in investing in an Enterprise Investment Scheme to defer paying capital gains tax when I cash some unit trusts. However, I have been told that some risk is involved. Is this true?     A YES, as Enterprise Investment Schemes deal in smaller, newer unquoted companies more risks are involved, athough some providers offer a degree of protection. However, these schemes are suitable only for experienced investors and require specialist advice, so please consult a financial adviser first.     Q I HAVE started working recently and wish to start saving. What do I need to take into account when deciding what sort of account to have?     A THE main things to consider are the interest rates payable, how easy it is to get at your money - generally the less accessibile it is, the higher the rate - and the minimum deposit required. If you haven't already got a mini cash ISA, then I'd recommend you look at one of these as they often pay favourable rates and the interest is tax-free. For a free guide call 0800 544644.     Q HOW old do you have to be to use your home to boost your income with an equity release scheme and are they a good idea?     A MOST equity release schemes will only consider you if you are over 65. For those who qualify and whose circumstances are suitable, they offer one way of raising income or capital in retirement. For a free guide ring 0800 544644.   ",1
PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT,"Dear Senior Forum: We are in our mid-40s. After watching our parents muddle through retirement, we think we should plan earlier than they did. My parents and my wife's mother are living near the poverty line. What advice do you have for couples trying to get ahead on retirement planning? - E.C.

Answer: Help your parents. Their opportunities for earning and saving were different than yours. Consider a list of ""10 Consumer Misperceptions That Can Hinder a Comfortable Retirement."" The list was prepared in a report from LIMRA (formerly the Life Insurance Marketing Research Association), the Society of Actuaries and Matthew Greenwald & Associates.
The 10 misperceptions from the researchers, with commentary from The Senior Forum:  1. Saving too little.  2. Not knowing when retirement will occur. (Know anyone who has been laid-off, fired, demoted or disabled in the 10 years before retirement?)  3. Living longer than planned.  4. Not facing facts about long-term care. (The facts are that most people will not need it, but those who do are likely to suffer financial ruin because of it.)  5. Failing to ensure guaranteed lifetime income. (This is the question of a lump-sum payout versus monthly installments on your retirement savings.)  6. Not understanding investments. (Oh, there are a lot of retirees and pre-retirees who thought their investment skills in the late 1990s were going to pave their way to the golden years. Ha!)  7. Relying on poor advice.  8. Not knowing sources of retirement income. (This refers to measuring one source against another and determining which are biggest and smallest, most secure or only temporary.)  9. Failing to deal with inflation.  10. Not providing for a surviving spouse.  All of these matters are better addressed sooner - in your mid-40s - than later. Retirement is not as difficult as a career. But retirement does still require hard work - both in preparation and in execution. ",1
"How QE made UK pensioners richer, but youth poorer; ANALYSIS","QUANTITATIVE easing has helped the rich get richer.

Bottom line, that was the finding of the Bank of England's report into the distributive effects of its Â£375bn moneyâ€“printing stimulus intended to jolt the economy back to life.
QE has boosted net household wealth by Â£600bn, the Bank said. Extrapolating from ONS figures on how is distributed, the richest 10pc of the population have seen a paper gain of about Â£129,000 per household.  To be more specific still, in terms of household financial assets, the Bank pointed out that the rich are those from the older generation â€“ pensioners and workers nearing retirement who own houses and share portfolios that account for more than half of those household assets.  In other words, as a demolition job of the angry claims by pensioner lobby groups that QE is impoverishing their members by lowering annuity rates, the report could not have been more comprehensive.  Sure, annuity rates are lower, the Bank conceded, but the other side of the same coin is that asset values are much higher. As a result, the overall effect on annuities has been ""broadly neutral"".  Those who have really suffered from the Bank's response to the financial crisis are aspirational young people looking to get on the property ladder and start saving. Record low interest rates of 0.5pc have made it harder to build up a deposit, while QE has made houses less affordable by pushing up prices.  In fact, the Bank said the only way in which QE has hurt pensions has been to increase the deficits of many finalâ€“salary schemes. But, once again, the young will be the casualties as ""the burden of these deficits is likely to fall on employers and future employees, rather than those coming up for retirement now"".  Although the Bank may have silenced its greyâ€“haired critics, the evidence of generational discrimination could throw up new problems by making more QE difficult to justify.  ""By confirming the positive wealth effects of QE are likely to have been skewed towards the betterâ€“off, the paper risks providing additional ammunition to the policy's critics,"" said Chris Crowe, UK economist at Barclays Capital. ""Apart from any distributional considerations, the fact that these consumers are [less likely] to consumeâ€¦ will have tended to blunt QE's effectiveness in boosting aggregate demand.""  Numerous economic studies have shown that assetâ€“rich individuals are less effective at boosting consumer demand than the less wellâ€“off, who are more likely to spend a windfall on the high street than on stocks and shares.  The fact the Bank has effectively chosen to favour the rich could also reignite the debate over how to operate QE.  Instead of buying gilts, some economists say, the Bank should be trying to boost growth by buying other assets. As the Bank conceded, there are ""distributional effects"" to QE, so why not distribute them differently? Mark Gull, coâ€“head of assetliability management at Pension Corporation, said: ""It is time for policy to adapt and for QE to be part of the growth agenda."" He suggested using QE to encourage infrastructure investment.  The paper is unlikely to silence vocal pensioners for long. It ignored the effect QE has had on inflation, confidence and jobs. And it extrapolated the estimated gains from the first Â£200bn of QE linearly for the second Â£125bn despite strong arguments that there are diminishing returns. The third Â£50bn instalment has been ignored completely. The paper may make it difficult to justify a fourth.",1
US cos forcing employees to save,"Bangladesh, Oct. 19 -- More American companies are turning to a new way of convincing employees to save more for retirement: make them do it. Companies from Apache Corp. to Google Inc. to Credit Suisse Group AG have boosted the percentage of worker paychecks automatically diverted to 401(k) plans well above the long-held standard of 3 per cent. Some are setting aside as much as 10 per cent of their workers' money or automatically increasing the amounts by 1 per cent a year unless employees opt out. But not all are matching the increased savings with company contributions. Millions of Americans aren't putting enough money aside for retirement, despite reforms designed to bulk up nest eggs and encourage employees to sock away more. There are incentives for companies to urge more-aggressive savings.
 They want to ensure they can make room for younger employees and aren't left with an aging workforce that doesn't have enough money ""to retire and move on,"" said Douglas Fisher, Fidelity Investments' head of policy development on workplace retirement. About 40 per cent of working households with those aged between 25 and 64 have no retirement savings, according to a study released last spring by the nonprofit National Institute on Retirement Security. ""The typical American household has almost nothing saved for retirement,"" said Nari Rhee, manager of the retirement-security program at the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment, according to agencies.

Property taxes will rise 3.37 percent if the Village of Bath's proposed 2016-17...,"Property taxes will rise 3.37 percent if the Village of Bath's proposed 2016-17 is adopted in early April.

Mayor Bill von Hagn said the tax increase included in the $4,724,474 budget proposal is about half the amount of last year's increase, when property taxes went up 6.2 percent.
The date the Village Board will hold a public hearing and vote on the spending plan has not yet been set, but the budget must be approved by April 15.  Under the proposed budget, homeowners would pay $28.93 per $1,000 of assessed value. Currently, residents pay $27.72 per $1,000 of assessed value.  â€œWe are working the (budget tax) increases down each year,"" von Hagn said. â€œAnd buying critically needed equipment.""

Summer reading gets a musical boost,"Several community libraries in the mid-Willamette Valley will get musical boost to their respective Summer Reading programs next month.

Children's musician Rich Glauber has July gigs scheduled in Mt. Angel, Lyons and Jefferson, a feature provided through the Oregon College Savings Plan (OCSP). The shows, dubbed ""Music in Action!,"" are described as high-energy, interactive mixes of songs, movement and comedy for all ages, using guitar, accordion, percussion and voice, along with a variety of props.
Organizers said Glauber's performance focuses on building community spirit and fun through music.  ""My shows are mostly about fun, about finding the joy of moving to music, singing out, playing instruments and celebrating life,"" Glauber said. ""Kids don't get enough of that these days, and I like to give them the opportunity when I come to town.""  OCSP facilitated the incorporation of this element into the prolific Summer Reading Programs, which are implemented at numerous community libraries around the region. Program officials specified that the performance is part of this year's annual Summer Reading program's ""On Your Mark, Get Set, Save!,"" a statewide campaign that encourages kids and teens to participate in summer reading at their local library.  ""Summer reading allows kids to pursue their individual interests while maintaining and strengthening reading skills like comprehension and vocabulary,"" said Michael Parker, executive director of the Oregon 529 Savings Network. ""Those are skills that can prevent a child from struggling academically during the school year, and help better prepare them for higher education in the future.""  The summer reading campaign runs from May 1 through Aug. 26. Oregon State Library counts 206,425 youth, ranging from infancy through age 18, who signed up the program last year at public libraries throughout Oregon. Collectively, registrants read 144,643 books, while least 68,735 achieved their reading goal and completed the 2015 summer reading program.  OCSP officials encourage parents to pick up an entry form at the library for a chance to win a $529 Oregon College Savings Plan account, plus $500 for the winner's library. Up to 15 winners â€” three from each Oregon congressional district â€” will be selected in a random drawing at the conclusion of the program.  The program is a partnership between the Oregon College Savings Plan, Oregon State Library and the Oregon Library Association.  To participate in the campaign, Oregon parents/guardians/grandparents must first enroll their children in the 2016 summer reading program at their local public library, then fill out a postage-paid entry card, available at the library, and drop it in the mail.

"State may expand pension eligibility for cops, firefighters","Police and firefighters across New Jersey could choose to retire after 20 years, regardless of their age, and collect a pension under a bill passed by the Assembly last week that creates another retirement option for some first responders.

The bill, A2562, removes a requirement that full-time police officers and firefighters enrolled in the Police and Fireman's Retirement System be at least 55 years old before they can collect a 50% pension after 20 years.
It was unanimously passed by the Senate in December, passed the Assembly with a 66-0 vote with three members abstaining, and now heads to Gov. Phil Murphy to sign into law.  The retirement option, however, is only available for two years after it becomes law. The timeframe was limited after lawmakers and critics raised concern about how much the retirement option could cost state and local governments.  ""It's more than just a job for those who go above and beyond the call of duty to protect and serve, but we must recognize that they can and do suffer from burnout,"" bill sponsor Assemblyman Ron Dancer, R-Ocean, said in a statement.  ""If they believe that it is in their best interest to retire with two decades of service, knowingly giving up valuable health benefits, we should permit them to do so.""  The non-partisan Office of Legislative Services, which analyzes the financial impact of pending legislation, said the bill could increase retirement allowances by $465 million annually if all 7,630 eligible police officers and firefighters took advantage of the retirement benefit.  But the office's fiscal estimate ""notes that it is not likely that all eligible members would retire under the new benefit,"" and that the true cost could not be determined.  The office's analysis also said local governments and the state could save money if pension members retire after 20 years and before becoming eligible for medical benefits after longer terms of service, but it could not calculate that savings amount.  Employees who enrolled in the police and firefighter pension system before 1999 were already eligible to retire after 20 years regardless of their age, according to the office's review.  The bill would expand that eligibility to those who enrolled since a 1999 law went into effect, according to Dancer.  Critics including the New Jersey League of Municipalities and New Jersey Association of Counties opposed the bill, saying it would drive up costs to municipal and county governments â€“ and thus property taxpayers â€“ if many officers and firefighters take the early retirement option.  Meanwhile the state's largest police unions backed the bill, saying it expanded a benefit already available to longer-serving police and firefighters.  New Jersey State Policemen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Colligan said he expected a small number of officers would take the early retirement option, and said it gave burnt-out officers ""a good opportunity to let them leave with something.""

Pension savers â€˜lose out on Â£715 millionâ€™,"Around half of people retiring each year do not shop around for an annuity and they are collectively losing out on income worth more than Â£237 million over a typical 22-year retirement, according to research for MGM Advantage.

The retirement specialist said that this figure, equivalent to Â£1,185 a head, is conservative. The total could be as high as Â£715 million, or Â£3,575 a head. This is despite the recent introduction of a code of conduct intended to increase awareness of the open-market option which allows you to shop around for the best rate.
Under the code, members of the Association of British Insurers (ABI) must send customers clear information in the run-up to their retirement to ensure they understand that they do not have to buy an annuity from the company that they have used to save for a pension.  They must also explain the potential benefits of enhanced annuities, which give preferential rates to customers with health problems or other risk factors, including people with high blood pressure and smokers.  The code was launched last year, but members were given until the first of this month to comply. The Financial Services Authority has already expressed concern that the code may not be enough to prevent serious consumer detriment and said in January that it will look at ways to reform the market, worth Â£11 billion a year, to make it work better for customers. Its thematic review could lead to a full-scale Competition Commission inquiry or specific remedies to force providers to warn customers more explicitly of the dangers of not shopping around.  Andrew Tully, of MGM Advantage said: â€œWe welcome the ABIâ€™s code of conduct and other industry initiatives which will make a difference. However these numbers show there is significant progress still to be made. A significant number of people could qualify for a better annuity rate because of existing health or lifestyle conditions, and yet only 4 per cent of people buy an enhanced annuity from the provider their savings are with.  â€œWe have also only looked at the annuity rates from providers competing in the open market. Many providers choose not to publish the rates they offer internal customers.""",1
Mis-selling victims are not fair game for complaints handlers;Comment;Opin ion,"HOMEBUYERS complaining about shortfalls on their endowment policies are seen in some quarters as being part of the compensation ""something for nothing"" culture.

This may be why there has been so little fuss, to date, over the proliferation of firms that offer to help individuals to secure redress. If the claimants are undeserving, who cares if they are preyed on by
companies that will take as much as 35 per cent of any compensation payout, as we report on pages 4-5?  This view is unfair. A sense of grievance over a shortfall is not a case for compensation. Homebuyers must establish that they were mis-sold, usually by a commission-seeking middleman. For this, they do not need the help of yet another middleman looking for a fat fee.  The activities of these claim firms should alarm homebuyers who have chosen not to complain over their underperforming endowments. Compensation is paid from the insurance fund, which means that those who remain are indirectly footing the bill for these companies' superfluous services.  (c) Times Newspapers Ltd, 2005 ",1
â€˜I've spent thousands hosting Ukrainian refugees â€“ the Government's payments aren't enoughâ€™,"Hosts receive a monthly 'thank you' payment of Â£350 â€“ but for some families it's 'nowhere near enough'

Payments made to British families welcoming families of Ukrainian refugees are â€œnowhere near enoughâ€, amid soaring energy bills and inflation, charities and hosts have said.
Volunteers who host Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion receive Â£350 a month per family as a â€œthank youâ€, provided they donâ€™t charge rent.  But hosts have argued that this money from the Government does not go far enough as energy and food bills continue to rise.  They are also spending thousands preparing their homes to accommodate large families.  'Energy bills have more than doubled'  Jonathan Clive Blake, 65, is the archbishop of the Open Episcopal Church. In March, he and his wife, Annette, 63, volunteered to host Ukrainian refugees. This week, after a month-long â€œbureaucratic nightmareâ€ of forms and visa processing, a family of five began living in their south London home.  Mr Blake estimated he spent at least Â£2,450 settling the family, buying new beds and turning the top floor of the house into a bedroom for the mother, father and four-year-old daughter.  Hosts must manually apply for the Â£350 payment at the end of every month. Mr Blake said: â€œItâ€™s disingenuous to suggest this is a â€˜thank youâ€™ payment when itâ€™s obviously long-term support to cover costs,â€ he said.  He added that the Government should invest in a â€œset-up grantâ€ for households who want to host Ukrainian refugees.  The familyâ€™s energy bills have more than doubled since the refugees moved in, having already skyrocketed following the increase in the energy price cap in April.  Mr Blake said: â€œOur energy bill went from Â£20 a week to Â£45 a week. With the family living here itâ€™s gone up to Â£90 a week. Itâ€™s a bit frightening.â€  While the refugee family grapples with the process of securing jobs, school places, and doctorsâ€™ appointments, Mr and Mrs Blake continue to provide financial support. Neither of the Ukrainian parents was able to continue working remotely for Kyiv-based companies â€“ although Mr Blake said the father had secured freelance work as a video editor in London.  â€œAt the moment they are disorientated,â€ he said. â€œSo weâ€™ve provided everything and guided them towards the things they need to do to get set up.  â€œWeâ€™ve got two fridges so weâ€™ve given them one. Theyâ€™ve started taking responsibility for the kidsâ€™ meals but we still share an evening meal.â€  The refugee family is aware of the rising energy costs and Mr Blake said the family would likely contribute â€œin time, based on how much they all useâ€. Ukrainian refugees are permitted to work in the UK, and also receive Â£200 upon arrival.  Between their full-time work and their portfolio of buy-to-lets, Mr and Mrs Blake have a â€œsecureâ€ income stream, although the couple set rents below the market average and refuse to raise them, not wanting to â€œcrippleâ€ tenants.  But Mr Blake said families who are less stable would be shocked by the immediate cost of welcoming displaced refugees.  â€œWeâ€™re more secure than many families without question but itâ€™s not as simple as it seems,â€ he said. â€œOn paper, weâ€™ve got quite a lot of assets in our name but thereâ€™s a mortgage to be paid. The cash you have is constrained. A less secure family is going to realise too late that there are all these things you have to buy that they werenâ€™t ready for.â€  'Nowhere near enough'  Stan Benes, of Opora, a platform offering emergency assistance to Ukrainians in the UK, said the â€œthank youâ€ payment had been misnamed, and the Government had issued â€œno clear guidanceâ€ to hosts regarding the intended purpose of the money.  â€œMany people were not prepared for what would be involved both practically and personally,â€ he said. â€œThe Â£350 is a nice amount out of context, but if you consider the fact it should be used to offset extra costs then itâ€™s nowhere near enough.  â€œThere are many ways this could have been approached â€“ and none of it is bad in and of itself â€“ but itâ€™s just not been thought through.â€  Helena Tubridy, 62, a fertility expert, is currently hosting a Ukrainian couple and their five-year-old at her home in County Meath, Ireland. She has also had to economise, despite the couple, 31 and 32 respectively, continuing to work remotely as hydroelectric engineers for Kyiv-based employers.  The Irish government offers â‚¬400 (Â£340) a month per property to hosts, while Ukrainian refugees receive a monthly payment. Ms Tubridy said: â€œWe are treating it as a house share â€“ we keep our food separate. Weâ€™ve always had to be careful. Itâ€™s all very manageable, but weâ€™re definitely feeling the pinch.â€  After two and a half months, the Ukrainian couple began contributing a third of the householdâ€™s energy bills.  A government spokesman said: â€œWeâ€™re grateful to the UK public who generously volunteered to opened their homes to those fleeing the war in Ukraine. We know there may be some small additional costs associated with helping out, which is we offer an optional â€˜thank youâ€™ payment of Â£350 per month for all those opening their homes.  â€œUnder the Homes for Ukraine scheme beneficiaries receive wrap-around support and can access work and benefits straight away, and receive a further Â£200 welcome payment upon arrival to cover any immediate costs.â€œ",1
Student loan situation offers quandary,"It was a kind of mania. People got in too deep, way overleveraged. Why? The cost of being in the game kept going up - but so, it seemed, did the return on investment. You just had to get in, get out and find a nice landing spot, before the music stopped.

Yes, that description fits the financial crisis that sparked the Great Recession. But it also describes student loans, which at a total of $1.75 trillion surpass Americans' aggregate credit-card debt and have some politicians talking about broad forgiveness. Both cases highlight a special brand of moral hazard - the kind our government creates when it helps fuel a problem, and then proposes a solution that allows others to escape the consequences of their actions.
Moral hazard is often invoked to describe the effects of a given action. For example: ""If we give amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people will immigrate here illegally."" That kind of moral hazard is worth heeding.  But another aspect is likely at play with student loans: Even talking about an action will prompt some people to behave as it will happen eventually. Returning to the immigration example: ""Because highranking politicians say they want to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants, more people already have immigrated here illegally.""  The mere possibility of being let offthe hook is enough for some desperate or just imprudent people to get themselves hooked in the first place - risking death or financial ruin.  Some actors in the financial crisis were probably (ahem) banking on a bailout if they got into trouble. There were plenty of examples within the memory of longtime executives: Penn Central Railroad, Lockheed, Franklin National Bank, Chrysler, Continental Illinois, various savings and loan institutions, even New York City - all between 1970 and 1990.  ""Too big to fail"" was almost 25 years old when it again became a common phrase in 2008. Too many lenders and investors had been spared the consequences of backing overly aggressive banks in the past.Were those banks indeed ""too big to fail""? Maybe. More to the point, the notion they might ever be allowed to fail came too late to prevent their bad behavior.  Back to student loans. No one believes for one second that a blanket forgiveness of student loans by the federal government - the lender in the vast majority of student loans - would be a one-time thing, any more than bank bailouts have been. If it is done once, it will become a permanent expectation.  But is it an expectation already?  Student debt certainly has increased in recent decades, by any measure. But short of thousands of borrowers admitting they took on debt thinking they'd get a bailout one day, it's hard to prove they acted on the expectation of loan forgiveness.  That said, the numbers tilt in that direction. The average cost for tuition and fees at a public university was about 5.1 times higher in 2020 than four decades earlier; for private universities, it was about 3.3 times higher.  The amount of debt per student was about 7.7 times higher. What's more, the share of enrolled students who took out loans also rose substantially.  Students' willingness to take on debt is growing out of proportion, even to the soaring cost of higher education. This, despite the increasing clarity that salaries for college graduates aren't keeping up with debt loads. (The debt-toincome ratio for college grads tripled between 1980 and 2020.)  Did politicians' promises to wipe out student debt spur these trends? We can't say for sure. But in a country divided 50-50 politically, with only two major parties, the eventual likelihood of leaders who favor loan forgiveness coming to power and finding a way to enact that policy surely is high enough for some people to believe their debts would be erased.  We're now navigating the hazards of that kind of thinking. The best way to reduce student borrowing may be to stop telling students they won't have to pay back their loans.

Rates rise is first for nearly four years.  ,"The cost of borrowing ended its downward spiral yesterday as the Bank of England increased interest rates for the first time in nearly four years.  

The Monetary Policy Committee's decision to put up rates by 0.25 per cent to 3.75 per cent will cost homeowners with a Â£60,000 mortgage just over Â£9 a month.  
If lenders pass on the full hike in rates, monthly repayments on a Â£60,000 loan will increase to Â£377.46 from Â£368.45, based on a new rate of 5.75 per cent.    Nationwide Building Society was the first major lender to announce it would be passing on the increase to borrowers, raising its base mortgage rate by 0.35 per cent to 4.89 per cent from December 1. It said savings rates would also go up, with most rates rising by 0.25 per cent.    The rest of the big lenders, including Halifax, Abbey, Barclays, HSBC, Cheltenham & Gloucester and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, are likely to follow suit.    Martin Ellis, Halifax's chief economist, said if lenders did pass on the rise a 0.25 per cent increase in rates would have very little impact on people's ability to pay their mortgage.    He said: 'It will add around Â£3 per week to a typical Â£80,000 mortgage - a figure which can easily be absorbed by the vast majority of UK households.'    More than half of new borrowers also took out fixed mortgages, which would be unaffected by any change in rates, he added. But the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors warned that an upward trend in rates would slow house price growth.    And Harvey Williams, RICS Midlands and national spokesman, predicted another interest rate rise in December.    Andrew Messenger, chief executive of the West Bromwich Building Society, noted the money markets were forecasting a five per cent base rate by 2004 which would increase mortgage payments by Â£65 a month on a Â£75,000 mortgage.    'That will make a significant difference,' he cautioned.    Borrowers, he said, should seek to fix their rates now for the next five years.   ",1
Bevin order aimed at blocking higher pension for Adkins,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) â€” Outgoing Republican Gov. Matt Bevin issued an executive order Thursday that would prevent longtime state Rep. Rocky Adkins from collecting a higher state pension due to the senior position he will assume in Democratic Gov.-elect Andy Beshear's administration.

The executive order, coming just days before Bevin leaves office, would prohibit â€œpension spiking."" The practice occurs when former legislators are able to calculate their pensions based on the higher-paying state jobs they take instead of their years of legislative service.
Bevin specifically mentioned Adkins in a press release announcing his executive order. The governor said it's â€œactuarially unsound and fundamentally unfair that a select group of individuals can enrich their own pensions"" and receive considerably more in benefits than they have paid in.  Beshear spokeswoman Crystal Staley responded that Bevin had â€œreturned to his attacks and name-calling"" in recent days.  â€œAll of that ends Dec. 10, when Gov. Beshear will begin to move the state forward with a tone of treating each other with respect and dignity,"" she said in a statement.  Adkins, in the same statement, said he refused to engage in â€œthe negative actions and comments of our outgoing governor.""  â€œAfter 33 years of service to the commonwealth, I look forward to joining the Beshear administration and working to uplift Kentucky families,"" Adkins said.  Beshear, the state's attorney general, defeated Bevin by a few thousand votes in last month's election, capping a hard-hitting campaign that settled their long-running political feud.  Beshear said this week that Adkins will serve as his senior adviser. By accepting the job offer from his one-time competitor, Adkins will end his decades-long legislative career. Adkins is the minority floor leader in the Republican-controlled House. He finished second behind Beshear in this year's Democratic gubernatorial primary.  The â€œpension spiking"" practice stems from a state law enacted in 2005 that allows lawmakers to spike their legislative pension using their highest three years of salary, even if that salary was earned in another government job, Bevin's office said. It has allowed some lawmakers to enrich their pensions.  â€œI'm asking Leader Adkins to retire from the General Assembly prior to his appointment in the executive branch so that his higher salary is not included in his final pension calculation,"" Bevin said. â€œAdditionally, I'm asking the governor-elect to follow the executive order issued today and prohibit any and all pension spiking in his administration.""  A question about Adkins' pension came up at the recent press conference where Beshear announced he was bringing the lawmaker into his administration. In his response, the governor-elect said: â€œRocky will be entitled to the position that is provided under law, given his service, when his service ends.â€  Once he takes office, Beshear could rescind Bevin's executive order.",1
"Young Canadians unrealistic about finances, analyst says  ","TORONTO -- Another seven per cent said they expect to be making more than $100,000 a year.  

Wayne Walker, the company's senior vice-president, said the results were exceptionally optimistic given that many starting lawyers and business graduates make $30,000 a year.  
""There may not have been a thorough understanding of marketplace salary levels,"" Walker told a news conference.    At the same time, 37 per cent of those surveyed said they'd be able to accumulate up to $100,000 in savings by 2001.    But another one-third said they only contribute a maximum of $1,000 a year to their own registered retirement savings plan or other investment program. Another 19 per cent indicated they put away up to $2,000 a year.    The survey also indicates about one-third think they'll have paid off the mortgage on a house or condominium in 10 years, with another 49 cent saying they will be buying property. Currently, about 62 per cent of Canadians own or are buying a home, he said.  ",1
Ask Amy: Parent wants in-laws to finance kids' higher education,"Dear Amy: My husband and I are parents to three college-age children. All three are good students that attend flagship state universities. Of course, as parents, we think they are great and well-rounded young adults. They have never given us a lick of trouble and have no trouble speaking and holding conversations with other adults, teachers, bosses, etc.We own our own home and drive old cars, but still struggle to pay our kids' tuition. We have saved money since our children were small to help defray their university costs, but even with the kids each taking $5,000 per year in loans it is still a struggle.My in-laws have always recognized birthdays and Christmas with modest gifts, and they always compliment us on how we raised them.
 That's the problem!We recently became aware that the in-laws have given tens of thousands of dollars to a local junior college foundation!We are hurt terribly by this, as it seems to us that they would rather give to kids they don't even know, than support their own grandkids' educations. (They also give to multiple animal charities).They are in their early-80s, and, although they seem to be relatively sane, we think they are being taken advantage of.Without coming across as greedy, how could we approach this?Wondering  Wondering: Inquiring about this isn't greedy. Judging your in-laws' financial decisions does make you sound greedy, however.  You and your spouse could approach the in-laws with a proposition: Perhaps they would be willing to invest in your kids' educations by offering these students no-interest loans, so that they could complete their educations without owing money (and interest) to an outside entity.  Upon completing their educations, the grandchildren could repay the loans directly to their grandparents, or (if the grandparents chose) directly into a charity the grandparents' chose.  Approach this with the very clear understanding that they have the right to make any financial decision they choose to make â€” even if you don't like it. Investing in the educational future of deserving local students seems like a wise and generous choice for them to make. If you could put your children in this category, they might be willing to expand their investment.  Dear Amy: I could use advice in helping my 6-year-old with attention-seeking.An example: After dance class, my daughter walked up to her teacher. The teacher skipped over her and disregarded her to talk to another student's mother.After a while, I asked my daughter if she wanted to leave. She said no.We waited in the lobby. The teacher walked right past us and left!My girl said, "".â€‰.â€‰. but I waited patiently!""I was crushed for her! She just wanted to tell her teacher a joke, but the teacher didn't care!I'm torn between anger at the teacher and wondering how to better teach social cues to my daughter.What do you suggest?Curious Mom  Curious Mom: Your daughter did everything right: She had something to share, and she waited patiently for her opportunity. But the opportunity didn't present itself.  But please don't blame the teacher for missing her own teacher-cues during this particular encounter. Sometimes teachers are swamped after class and simply don't continue to focus their attention onto the little ones (although they should).  This should not be a crushing blow for either of you, but more of a ""Dang! That's frustrating!"" situation. You could ask your daughter to strategize about how she can get her teacher's attention before or after the next class to share her joke. She might want to write it down and put it in an envelope to give to her instructor. She could also get there a little early and say, ""Excuse me, can I tell you a short joke?"" while the other students are changing their shoes.  Your daughter deserves eye contact, a moment of undistracted attention and an appreciative smile from her teacher. I hope she gets it.  Dear Amy: Thank you for your response to ""Concerned Dad,"" the man who didn't want his brother-in-law to bring his gun into the dad's household. I assume you've caught a lot of heat for being so passionately anti-gun, but I appreciated it.Another Concerned Dad  Another Concerned Dad: Yes â€” I am completely anti-gun when it comes to young children, because research clearly shows that kids are at great risk around firearms.  And because I believe in a person's individual rights and freedom, this includes their right not to have guns brought into their household.

"How much should conservative, balanced and aggressive investors expect to make annually? The latest financial market return projections suggest muted returns are ahead","Heard the argument that the economy will grow more slowly than in the past because of our aging population?

The same applies to your investment portfolio. The latest financial market return projections issued for financial planners to use in their work suggest investors of all types should rein in expectations on how their portfolios will perform over the long term (10 years and longer). Forget double digits, or even high single digits. Anything north of 5 per cent looks out of reach for most investors.
The return projections for 2019 were recently published by the FP Canada Standards Council and Institut quÃ©bÃ©cois de planification financiÃ¨re. Theyâ€™re meant to provide an analytical view on returns that is free from the bias of individual planners and investment advisers. You can find expected returns for the major asset classes in this recent post . Now letâ€™s look at how these return expectations come together in portfolios designed for conservative, balanced and aggressive investors. Note: These are after-fee returns, with the fee set at 1.25 per cent.  * Conservative (5-per-cent cash, 70-per-cent bonds, 25-per-cent Canadian stocks): Average net annual returns of 3.16 per cent.  * Balanced (5-per-cent cash, 45-per-cent bonds, 40-per-cent Canadian stocks, 10-per-cent foreign developed market stocks): An annualized 3.74 per cent  * Aggressive (5-per-cent cash, 20-per-cent bonds, 35-per-cent Canadian stocks, 25-per-cent foreign developed market stocks, 15-per-cent emerging market stocks): 4.5 per cent annually.  Itâ€™s not only the returns for these three investor profiles that seem low. So are the fees. While some advisers may charge as little as 1.25 per cent of your account assets in fees, there are additional costs for investments. Even a low-cost portfolio of exchange-traded funds could add an additional 0.25 to 0.5 of a percentage point. In mutual funds, fees could easily exceed 2 per cent.  Sadly, this suggests that if the subdued projections for financial planners err at all, itâ€™s on the optimistic side. How depressing.

How a youthful land dabble paid off   ,"TRUE CONFESSIONS   

Queensland mother, commerce student and investor Kirsten Buckett's first investment experience was buying a piece of land when not long out of her teens   
What happened?     I WAS lucky to get interested in property at a relatively early age (21) and bought my first block of land in a very good suburb which gained in value beyond my expectations. This showed me that the capital growth of an investment was potentially worth more than term deposit interest, especially when rates are so low.     What's the best investment decision you've ever made?     Buying the block of land where my current house is situated in Pullenvale, near Brisbane. We were lucky enough to get acreage land but didn't have to pay today's inflated prices. Building an appropriate style house to suit the area has enhanced its value even more. Being our principal place of residence means no capital gains tax will have to be paid when we sell.     What about the worst?     Procrastinating. There have been two or three real estate opportunities that I did not proceed with where in hindsight we would have doubled their value in five years.     I should not have said ""no"" immediately and perhaps I should have found a way to purchase them.     What's the best piece of investment advice you've received?     To try to minimise your tax wherever possible, but don't be afraid to pay tax because this means you must be making a good income in order to have to pay it.     What advice would you give to an investor who's just starting out?     Education. The better informed a person is, the better decisions a person can make. Markets are uncertain, but if you understand them fully you are less likely to make mistakes or get taken in by shonky dealers. An organisation like the Australian Investors Association can help give you a market understanding and put you in touch with others who have the same interest.     How do you react when the markets get rocky?     I stick to my short-term and long-term strategies and try not to deviate from the initial plan. In saying that, I have sometimes moved my goal posts and I think you need to be aware of what is happening in the markets but be able and willing to adapt them if necessary. Long-term investments, in particular, make it easier to stay firm in your investments because most markets are cyclical, and to sell out when markets have crashed is a bit silly. If you can, you should try and wait for the recovery.     What's the biggest investment risk you've ever taken? And did it pay off?     Deciding to build my first home on the block of land that I had purchased. I did this at a young age, completely on my own, not knowing if I could ever afford to meet the repayments without getting a tenant. I was very lucky in that my income increased along with the markets, so by the time I sold about eight years later I had more than doubled my initial investment. It was very scary to take this sort of step without a partner to run things by.     What would you never do with your money?     I would never invest in ambiguous ventures like property development deals where they wrap up the deal by recommending their mates for the peripheral deals that are associated with property purchase. Things like recommending solicitors, property valuers, mortgage lenders etcetera. My philosophy is that if it looks too good to be true then it usually is.     Where do you source most of your investment information/research?     For real estate I use the local papers, internet and local knowledge, so I have a pretty good feel for price levels in the area. For other investments, I use newspapers and and magazines. In particular I like to read Property Investor magazine. For other financial information, AIA meetings, newsletters, seminars and their website are invaluable.     What, for you, are the most important attributes of a good financial planner?     I am lucky I don't need to use one but I would have to say that to be good and reputable in that industry you need to be able to give unbiased advice. I don't like the fact that a lot of advice is given on the back of receiving commissions.     What are your views on socially responsible, or ethical, investments?     It sounds good in theory to have a social conscience when making investment decisions. Everyone should be trying to help out in their own way but I feel everything has a price and I would not like to make a major investment decision driven by ethical reasons alone.     Would you feel comfortable about running a portfolio of individual direct shares?     Yes, I basically do that now, but I would like to expand that. I have always been a cautious investor who prefers bricks and mortar. However, I am diversifying into direct shares and equity trusts and term deposits. I have found that being involved in AIA has given me the confidence to branch out into other markets.     How do you feel about investing overseas?     I don't feel the need, and there is a lot to know to reduce the risk of this type of investment. Not only do you need to understand the market or company you are investing in but there are also major currency risks involved as well.   ",1
Buying a first home causes relationship strife and illness,"The latest research from specialist bank Aldermoreâ€™s quarterly First Time Buyer Index explores the impact of the difficulties faced by first time buyers in the current housing market. The results show the process of buying a first property causes so much stress for some people it has made them ill (35 per cent) or caused issues in their relationship (34 per cent).

This stress is understandable. Aldermoreâ€™s figures show nearly one in five (17 per cent) recent first time buyers took three or more attempts to buy their home, while a quarter (27 per cent) had to delay by more than two years. The impact of the buying process even resulted in two fifths (40 per cent) of respondents feeling like they have had to rebuild their life due to the compromises they had to make to get on the housing ladder.
Hurdles and sacrifices  The Index also reveals the most common hurdles recent first time buyers had to overcome and the sacrifices they made in order to buy their first home. The main challenge for nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of respondents was raising a deposit - one in five (20 per cent) had to wait between six to 10 years to save enough money. In order to do so, over a third (37 per cent) cut back on taking holidays and eating out.  Nearly one in 10 (9 per cent) found the actual process of securing a mortgage the biggest difficulty, and the same number (10 per cent) cited the whole buying process as the biggest problem. For a further 8 per cent of first time buyers it was the length of the purchase process.  Getting on the housing ladder  When asked what could be done to improve the situation, almost a third (32 per cent) recent first time buyers requested the issue of rising house prices to be addressed. For over one in three (34 per cent) respondents, simplifying the whole buying process would help, while three in ten (30 per cent) believe the situation would improve if better mortgage products were available.  In control of life  In the end though, the positives outweigh the negatives. Nearly three quarters (73 per cent) of recent first time buyers felt like they had reached adulthood when they got the keys to their first home, and almost seven in ten (69 per cent) found that putting their own stamp on their new home to be an empowering experience.  Three quarters (75 per cent) of recent first time buyers feel they are no longer wasting money on rent, and 70 per cent believe owning their own home gives them financial control.  Charles McDowell says: â€œOur latest quarterly first time buyer index reveals the issues recent first time buyers have faced when getting on the property ladder and the impact this is having on their day-to-day lives. Buying a first home is an empowering experience and can provide financial control, but our research shows the sacrifices being made by first time buyers to reach that first rung of the property ladder are negatively impacting their health and personal relationships.  â€œAlmost one in ten (9 per cent) found the process of securing a mortgage the biggest difficulty which is why at Aldermore we are committed to helping to those who are struggling to gather a deposit by offering a range of products, including the family guarantee mortgage and 95 per cent mortgages for customers who have a smaller deposit.â€",1
Ten Developments in the Retirement Plan Industry,"Executives from MassMutual and Voya Financial discussed trends driving the retirement plan industry.

Executives from Voya Financial and MassMutual discussed 10 developments in the retirement plan industry at the 2016 PLANADVISER National Conferenceâ€™s panel, â€œTop Trends.â€
First and foremost are new regulations and policies, led by the new fiduciary rule, said Charles Nelson, chief executive officer of retirement at Voya Financial. â€œEach company will approach it differently,â€ he said. â€œSome may utilize the best interest contract (BIC) exemption or retreat from offering certain services. At Voya, we will utilize the BIC where it is most appropriate.â€  Another regulatory development is open multiple employer plans (MEPs), which have a chance of being â€œapproved in Washington, and that could help us grow our industry,â€ Nelson said.  Second, is the growing recognition of the cost of employees not being retirement ready. â€œMany years ago, companies sought to limit their liabilities by freeing their defined benefit plans,â€ said Tina Wilson, senior vice president, head of retirement solutions innovation at MassMutual. â€œBut that liability still exists if employees donâ€™t have sufficient funds to retire and are financially trapped.â€  Sponsors and their advisers need to ensure that participants are â€œfunding their plan adequately,â€ Wilson said. â€œTypically, the CFO is not engaged in the plan. We looked at plans with 1,000 employees and found that, on average, it is costing them $2.7 million to $3 million a year in the liability of employees unable to retire. We must measure this costâ€ and call sponsorsâ€™ attention to it.  Third is the need to engineer a retirement plan for success. â€œ401(k) plans were designed to be supplemental,â€ said Nelson, who then pointed to six ways advisers can help â€œDB-itizeâ€ defined contribution plans. Use automatic enrollment, he said, paired with qualified default investment alternatives (QDIAs) that place participantsâ€™ funds into appropriately diversified portfolios. â€œOptimize the match to ensure people are saving at the right levels. Use escalation, reenrollment and embrace incomeâ€ options, he said.  NEXT: Outcomes  Fourth is the value of investments in driving outcomes. MassMutual has studied outcomes in detail and has learned for â€œsavers early on, investments are irrelevant,â€ Wilson said. â€œInstead, itâ€™s about how much you save. But at age 40, 45, investments become critical.â€ Thatâ€™s why people at this age and older need to be invested in â€œtarget-date funds, managed accounts or custom portfolios that are a diversified default,â€ she said.  Fifth, it is important to apply behavioral science to retirement innovation. â€œInnovation is critical and we havenâ€™t been that innovative with enrollment,â€ Nelson said. â€œWe donâ€™t think everything should be digital. Choose different platformsâ€ for different touch points, he said.  Sixth, are data-driven asset allocation solutions. By this, Wilson said, the industry needs to embrace smart data platforms where demographics are tailored to â€œindividualized circumstances to select [a certain] glidepath or custom allocation. Itâ€™s much more proscriptive on am individualized level.â€  Seventh is weighing income replacement versus account balances. â€œIncome is the new outcome,â€ Nelson said. â€œPlan sponsors are becoming increasingly focused on income, and that is how you are going to be measured going forward. But include all sources, including IRAs and Social Security.â€  Eighth is finding solutions for income. â€œIncome is also very personal,â€ Wilson said. â€œSolutions need to work for each individual. No one size fits all. It must be a set of solutions that are worked through an adviser, not a tool.â€  Ninth is financial wellness that extends beyond the defined contribution plan. This means â€œholistic solutions to solve income stream needs. Income needs fluctuate in retirement, so solutions should be designed accordingly,â€ Nelson said.  Finally, participants need help navigating healthcare costs and building true financial wellness. â€œBecause participants say healthcare costs prevent them from saving more for retirement, we need to talk about a benefits budget to optimize their spending and help them make better financial decisions,â€ Wilson said.",1
The dos and don'ts of RRSP contributions   ,"A Registered Retirement Savings Plan is not for everyone, but for those who are considering RRSPs or have them, here are some dos and don'ts:   

- Don't rush. Often people rush to make a last-minute RRSP contribution and give little thought to the underlying investment. Spend a few minutes to remember how long it took you to earn that money and slow the selection process down. Consider making contributions to your RRSP in cash and look at all your available investment options prior to making an investment decision.   
- Don't over-contribute. Know your RRSP limit for the year and don't contribute more or you may be subject to penalties and interest. This past year we noted a campaign by Canada Revenue Agency that resulted in several letters being sent to individuals who have made over-contributions.     - Don't make withdrawals. People who make contributions to an RRSP and pull the money out before retirement can end up paying more tax than what they first saved as a deduction. Avoid contributing RRSP unless you can commit the funds until retirement.     - Do consolidate your RRSP accounts. Some people have multiple RRSP accounts held at different financial institutions. They may have $10,000 at Institution A from a 2004 RRSP contribution, $6,000 at RRSP Institution B from a 2005 RRSP contribution, and $8,000 at Institution C from a 2006 RRSP contribution. This may result in additional RRSP fees being charged to you and result in more fees than you need to pay. More importantly, your investments become more difficult to manage. Consolidate your RRSP accounts at one institution for better management, to reduce fees and to open up more investment options.     - Don't underestimating life expectancy. All too often people in their 60s begin pulling money out of their RRSP solely to avoid paying a large tax bill if they were to pass away. We encourage people to plan for the most likely outcome rather than the worst-case scenario.     - Do name a beneficiary. If you are married or living common law then the natural choice is your spouse for the tax-free rollover provisions on the first passing. Often, widows will still have their deceased spouses named as beneficiary. We have seen cases where people have remarried and have their ex-spouse still listed as a beneficiary. In some cases naming your estate may be the best option.     - Do think carefully about whether investments should be inside or outside an RRSP. Hold interest-generating investments within your RRSP along with equities that you may trade from time to time. Outside your RRSP, consider investments that are long-term holds that generate primarily capital gains. For non-registered accounts, Canadians are not taxed on unrealized gains until the investment is sold.     - - -     Keith Greenard CIM FCSI and Kevin Greenard CA FMA CFP are members of The Greenard Group at ScotiaMcLeod in Victoria.

Bill Summary  (Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced and does not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at http://www.leg.state.co.us/billsummaries.)  A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to exempt property from the decedent's estate. On and after January 1, 2012, the dollar limit for exempt property to which a surviving spouse is entitled is increased from $26,000 to $78,000. On and after January 1, 2012, the dollar limit for the family allowance taken out of the estate for the maintenance of the family during the administration of the estate is increased from $24,000 to $72,000.  The current law provides for an annual cost of living adjustment for exempt property and for the family allowance. The bill suspends those cost of living adjustments for one year when the increase in the dollar amounts due to this bill takes effect.  Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado:  SECTION 1. 15-11-403, Colorado Revised Statutes, is amended to read:  15-11-403. Exempt property. (1) (a) PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2012, the decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to exempt property from the estate in the form of cash in the amount of or other property of the estate in the value of twenty-six thousand dollars in excess of any security interests therein. If there is no surviving spouse, the decedent's dependent children are entitled jointly to the same exempt property. Rights to exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate, except claims for the costs and expenses of administration, and reasonable funeral and burial, interment, or cremation expenses, which shall be paid in the priority and manner set forth in section 15-12-805. The right to exempt property shall abate as necessary to permit payment of the family allowance. These rights are in addition to any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or dependent children by the decedent's will, unless otherwise provided, by intestate succession, or by way of elective-share.  (b) ON AND AFTER JANUARY 1, 2012, THE DECEDENT'S SURVIVING SPOUSE IS ENTITLED TO EXEMPT PROPERTY FROM THE ESTATE IN THE FORM OF CASH IN THE AMOUNT OF OR OTHER PROPERTY OF THE ESTATE IN THE VALUE OF SEVENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS IN EXCESS OF ANY SECURITY INTERESTS THEREIN.

THE RIGHT TO EXEMPT PROPERTY SHALL ABATE AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PAYMENT OF THE FAMILY ALLOWANCE. THESE RIGHTS ARE IN ADDITION TO ANY BENEFIT OR SHARE PASSING TO THE SURVIVING SPOUSE OR DEPENDENT CHILDREN BY THE DECEDENT'S WILL, UNLESS OTHERWISE PROVIDED, BY INTESTATE SUCCESSION, OR BY WAY OF ELECTIVE-SHARE.  (2) The dollar amount stated in PARAGRAPH (a) OR (b) OF subsection (1) of this section shall be increased or decreased based on the cost of living adjustment as calculated and specified in section 15-10-112; EXCEPT THAT, WHEN THE INCREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNT STATED IN PARAGRAPH (b) OF SUBSECTION (1) OF THIS SECTION, AS ENACTED IN SENATE BILL 11-________, ENACTED IN 2011, TAKES EFFECT, THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR ONE YEAR.  SECTION 2. 15-11-405 (1), Colorado Revised Statutes, is amended to read:  15-11-405. Source, determination, and documentation. (1) (a) (I) If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised or disposed of by memorandum under section 15-11-513 to any person other than a person entitled to exempt property may not be used to satisfy rights to exempt property. Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, the guardians of minor children, or dependent children who are adults may select property of the estate as their exempt property. The personal representative may make these selections if the surviving spouse, the dependent children, or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time or there is no guardian of a minor child. The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as exempt property allowance. PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2012, the personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum not exceeding twenty-four thousand dollars or periodic installments not exceeding two thousand dollars per month for one year and may disburse funds of the estate in payment of the family allowance. The personal representative or an interested person aggrieved by any selection, determination, payment, proposed payment, or failure to act under this section may petition the court for appropriate relief, which may provide a family allowance other than that which the personal representative determined or could have determined.  (II) IF THE ESTATE IS OTHERWISE SUFFICIENT, PROPERTY SPECIFICALLY DEVISED OR DISPOSED OF BY MEMORANDUM UNDER SECTION 15-11-513 TO ANY PERSON OTHER THAN A PERSON ENTITLED TO EXEMPT PROPERTY MAY NOT BE USED TO SATISFY RIGHTS TO EXEMPT PROPERTY. SUBJECT TO THIS RESTRICTION, THE SURVIVING SPOUSE, THE GUARDIANS OF MINOR CHILDREN, OR DEPENDENT CHILDREN WHO ARE ADULTS MAY SELECT PROPERTY OF THE ESTATE AS THEIR EXEMPT PROPERTY. THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE MAY MAKE THESE SELECTIONS IF THE SURVIVING SPOUSE, THE DEPENDENT CHILDREN, OR THE GUARDIANS OF THE MINOR CHILDREN ARE UNABLE OR FAIL TO DO SO WITHIN A REASONABLE TIME OR THERE IS NO GUARDIAN OF A MINOR CHILD. THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE MAY EXECUTE AN INSTRUMENT OR DEED OF DISTRIBUTION TO ESTABLISH THE OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY TAKEN AS EXEMPT PROPERTY ALLOWANCE. ON AND AFTER JANUARY 1, 2012, THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE MAY DETERMINE THE FAMILY ALLOWANCE IN A LUMP SUM NOT EXCEEDING SEVENTY-TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OR PERIODIC INSTALLMENTS NOT EXCEEDING SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER MONTH FOR ONE YEAR AND MAY DISBURSE FUNDS OF THE ESTATE IN PAYMENT OF THE FAMILY ALLOWANCE. THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OR AN INTERESTED PERSON AGGRIEVED BY ANY SELECTION, DETERMINATION, PAYMENT, PROPOSED PAYMENT, OR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER THIS SECTION MAY PETITION THE COURT FOR APPROPRIATE RELIEF, WHICH MAY PROVIDE A FAMILY ALLOWANCE OTHER THAN THAT WHICH THE PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE DETERMINED OR COULD HAVE DETERMINED.  (b) The dollar amount stated in SUBPARAGRAPH (I) OR (II) OF paragraph (a) of this subsection (1) shall be increased or decreased based on the cost of living adjustment as calculated and specified in section 15-10-112; EXCEPT THAT, WHEN THE INCREASE IN THE DOLLAR AMOUNT STATED IN SUBPARAGRAPH (II) OF PARAGRAPH (a) OF THIS SUBSECTION (1), AS ENACTED IN SENATE BILL 11-________, ENACTED IN 2011, TAKES EFFECT, THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WILL BE SUSPENDED FOR ONE YEAR.

Seeking a safer haven; Renting out property is still a popular way to make money for those wary of shares  ,"HIGH-tech worker Peter Minshall is losing confidence in the stock market to help him secure his financial future, so he is turning to property instead.  

The 32-year-old IT consultant from Battersea, south-west London, says: 'As a contractor, I am often paid lump sums rather than a regular salary and have always used them for pensions and investment plans.  
'I don't want all my assets to be in stock market-based schemes, especially the way markets are today. So I decided to use a recent bonus to buy a property to let.' Peter went through New World Mortgages, the phone and internet lender launched in Britain by parent company Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 'The application process was easy and I had no problems raising the funds or finding tenants,' he says.    Peter is getting income from rent and expects to see good capital growth if house prices continue to rise.    But can property investments really outperform shares?    In its latest lettings report, which takes in the views of agents across the country, Bradford & Bingley Lettings Agents says that renting out a flat gives the owner a return of up to 10 per cent of its value a year, though this is before the cost of management fees, maintenance and insurance.    The average annual income after these costs is seven per cent, according to B&B still higher than most bank or building society savings accounts, which rarely top six per cent. And the property market also offers significant potential for capital growth.    Meanwhile, share dividends are providing less than three per cent and capital values are falling with the spread of international equity turmoil.    John Crossley, head of Bradford & Bingley Lettings Agents, says: 'While rentals account for about 11 per cent of the UK housing market, they are on the increase. There is growing demand from tenants for properties to rent rather than buy because modern living requires more mobility and young, high-earning professionals seem to want more flexibility.' Other factors are also making experts optimistic about the buy-to-let market.    Roger Hillier, product development manager of lender Mortgage Express, says: 'A rising number of divorces is creating new households needing somewhere to live. Also, first-time buyers are considerably older now than those in the Eighties, which means more people are renting for longer.' Since their introduction in 1996, buyto-let mortgages have brought interest rates in line with standard mortgages, rather than forcing buyers of investment properties to borrow at steep commercial rates.    THE latest big name lender to enter the market is Cheltenham & Gloucester, which offers loans direct to the public and through Lloyds TSB branches.    It provides property investor deals with an interest rate of 7.25 per cent, though borrowers must have a deposit of at least 20 per cent of the purchase price.    Most buy-to-let lenders are like C&G and require borrowers to stump up hefty deposits before loans are agreed.    But they are becoming more flexible about the amount they will offer.    Most will now take rental income into account when loans are offered, while in the past they based the amount they would lend almost entirely on applicants' salaries.    Crossley warns that buyers need funds to cover periods when they might not have tenants, and should also be aware that it can take a long time to realise the asset if they decide to sell when the property market is falling.

Martin Lewis' tip to save Â£40 a year if you pay for your NHS prescriptions,"Money Saving Expert Martin Lewis has a tip for people to save around Â£40 on their prescriptions every year. It could be a useful piece of advice with a cost of living crisis getting worse for Brits

With a cost of living crisis already hitting Brits and a stark rise in costs around the corner, Brits have been looking at extra ways to save money.
One way they can do this is by saving on their medical prescriptions.  Martin Lewis and the Money Saving Expert team recently revealed that around one million people overpaid for their prescription in the 12 months to April 2021.  They argued that people missed out on average savings of Â£40 on medical prescriptions alone.  With the crisis set to get worse in April as tax rises take effect, along with a rise in the cap in energy bills by around Â£693 a year for the average household, even little ways of saving could soon be vital for many Brits.  Prescription charges could also soon rise, so how can Brits save on their prescriptions  How can I save on my prescriptions  People can save up to Â£40 per year on their medical prescriptions by avoiding individual payments on their medication.  If you regularly pay for medication, it is worth buying an NHS prepayment certificate for unlimited prescriptions.  An investigation by Money Saving Expert found that figures from the NHS Business Services Authority showed 1,063,648 people paid for at least 12 prescriptions in the 2020/21 financial year, with at least 16 prescriptions being purchased on average.  How much is an NHS prescription season ticket  An NHS prescription season ticket -officially known as a prescription prepayment certificate PPC -is now worth Â£108.10.  Those concerned about making such a large payment in one go should note that they do not have to pay it all at once -instead you can pay by direct debit in 10 instalments of Â£10.81 each.  With prices rises looming in April, it is entirely possible that the price of the PPC will go up. By how much it is not yet known, so it is recommended that those wanting to purchase their certificate should do so before the April deadline.  Will the price of my prescription go up  It has not yet been confirmed if the price of NHS prescriptions will go up, but will likely do so if the current trend continues.  A single prescription currently costs Â£9.35 and prescriptions have gone up by 26.35% over the last 10 years.  A continuing of this trend would see another 2.63% increase this year, meaning prescriptions could go up to Â£9.57 in the next few weeks.  This change would only affect people in England as they remain free in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.",1
Fed Rate Hike: 7 Questions (and Answers),"It wasn't a question of if, but when. And the answer is ""now,"" as the Federal Reserve Board announced Wednesday that it would raise interest rates just in time for the new year, and a new administration.

During the Fed's Dec. 14 meeting, the Federal Open Market Committee voted for a 0.25-percentage-point increase, raising the federal funds interest rate to 0.75%. It was the first increase since a 0.25-percentage-point hike in December 2015, which Federal Reserve Board Chair Janet Yellen positioned then as a vote of confidence in the U.S. economy. That hike was the first increase in almost 10 years.
All the big banks have funds at the Federal Reserve, and the Fed's pronouncements on rates set how much interest those banks can charge one another to borrow money to meet reserve requirements. It's the banking world's equivalent of an emergency fund. (This is why Wall Street watchers sit vigil in anticipation of the board's every utterance.) That, in turn, dictates terms for savers and borrowers seeking the best ones on deposits and loans.  Now that the Fed has made its pronouncement and the interest rate winds have changed direction, the next step for consumers depends on which side of the saving-borrowing divide they stand. For guidance, NerdWallet's in-house experts respond to the most pressing questions from savers, homeowners, home shoppers, credit card holders and investors.  1. What impact will the rate hike have on my retirement savings?  Predicting the effect the federal funds rate increase has on any individual investor's retirement savings depends a lot on his or her near-term plans for the money and what's in his or her portfolio: Large U.S.-based companies? Foreign stocks? Dividend-payers? Indexed investments? Individual stocks concentrated in particular sectors?  When a rate increase is expected (as this one has been for many months), the effect on the overall market is usually baked into stock prices already, at least partially. It's reasonable to expect at least a bit of short-term stock market anxiety in response to the news, since Wall Street is notoriously easy to spook. Intermittent volatility in exchange for higher potential returns on your long-term savings is par for the course. The stock market's post-election dive and quick turnaround race to all-time highs is just the most recent example.  2. Should I adjust my investing strategy?  In NerdWallet's new end-of-year financial savings survey, 17% of Americans said that stock market volatility is one of their top sources of financial anxiety. Our advice for how to handle potential market turbulence remains the same as it always has been for long-term investors: Take a deep breath, don't make any sudden moves and concentrate on the things you can control. (Fiddling around with a Roth IRA savings calculator is a more worthwhile distraction than fiddling with the investments in your account.) Some other suggestions if you need something to keep your hands busy until 'business as usual' resumes:  * Revisit your original investment plan: Do the effects of higher interest rates change your long-term expectations for any of the investments in your portfolio? In the near term, they might, especially if you're invested in stocks, exchange-traded funds or mutual funds in industries that are in expansion mode (where the higher costs of borrowing can influence the ability to invest in future growth) or heavily reliant on consumers' ability to finance purchases (think homes and cars). But what about longer term? If your original investment thesis still stands, then stand by your investments.  * Check up on your asset allocation: A well-balanced portfolio that contains a diversified mix of assets helps investors sleep well through even the most raucous Federal Reserve Board meeting. Find a quiet spot to review your retirement portfolio's allocation. But don't be too quick to move things around in response to what is likely just a short-term blip. (Here's more on what it means to diversify and guidance on four ways to rebalance your portfolio.)  * Make the most of money you need in the next three to 10 years: Don't forget to consider your short-term savings as part of your overall portfolio. Any money earmarked for upcoming expenses (such as the first handful of years for retirement or a down payment on a home) should be invested in more predictable and less volatile investments than the stock market.  * Take advantage of market volatility by investing whenever the market takes a hit: Running toward the wreckage with your money takes nerves of steel. But the rewards of following through on the first part of the 'buy low, sell high' rule of thumb are well worth it. You don't have to dive into the discount bin with all of your money at once, either. Adding to your positions over time (aka dollar-cost averaging) is one of the best investing strategies. See how even small savings increases can affect your future way of life with a retirement calculator.  3. What does the rate hike mean for my savings account?  Rates on savings accounts might go up, but they won't jump overnight, and increases wouldn't be significant. Banks consider many factors when setting savings rates, and a Fed rate increase doesn't play a huge role in those decisions. Still, a bank typically will look at how its competitors respond to a Fed increase, and if other financial institutions keep savings rates low, it won't have much incentive to increase its own rates. But if banks start raising their rates, others will likely feel compelled to do the same to stay competitive.  It's probably best to keep your expectations low. When the Fed announced its hike in December 2015, many of the biggest banks reacted in the same way: They raised loan rates and left savings rates unchanged. This boosted banks' margins.  4. Will the rate hike affect my CDs?  Standard CDs will be affected in much the same way that savings accounts will: Rates might go up over time, but not by a lot. Keep in mind that most standard CDs come with fixed interest rates, so even if your bank's rates do go up, your CDs' annual percentage yields won't change.  Some banks, however, offer bump-up CDs that let customers request a rate increase if the bank's rates rise. In most cases, customers can exercise this option only once during a CD's term. These types of CDs usually have lower interest rates than fixed-rate certificates, and many have higher deposit requirements. Still, if you have one, keep track of your bank's rates. If they go up, ask your financial institution to adjust your CD accordingly.  5. Is the interest rate on my credit cards going up?  Probably. Interest rates on credit cards typically rise or fall with the prime rate, which is directly affected by the Fed's action. When the Fed boosted rates by 0.25 percentage point in December 2015, most major issuers raised the annual percentage rates on their cards by an equal amount within a month or so. If your rate is going up, you might not even hear about it from your credit card company. Although card issuers usually have to give you 45 days' notice of an increase in your APR, there's an exception for increases triggered by a change in the prime rate. So keep an eye on the APRs listed on your credit card statement.  A higher APR on your credit card means it will cost more to carry debt, although how much more depends on your balance. Your APR is a factor in how your minimum payment is calculated, so that could go up as well. Regardless of the effect in dollar terms, reducing your credit card debt is always a wise move.  6. How will a rate hike affect my mortgage?  Thirty-year fixed mortgage rates rose more than half a point (0.50%) in the four weeks following the election of Donald Trump, according to the NerdWallet Mortgage Rate Index. Rates are solidly over 4% for the first time this year. Considering a $300,000, 30-year fixed rate mortgage, each half-point increase adds close to $100 a month to your payment.  So, that's already happened.  Â» MORE: Calculate your monthly mortgage payment  With additional Fed rate hikes expected next year, mortgage rates may have as much as another half point to go. That would put home loan interest rates just under 5% by the end of 2017. Refinance activity has already taken a hit, as rates have climbed to their highest levels since July 2015.  And that's before Republicans begin implementing their stated agenda to reduce the government's role in the mortgage market. Those moves could also cause mortgage rates to edge higher, though it might be some time before the Trump administration gets around to its mortgage market reform.  * If you're already a homeowner with a fixed-rate mortgage, you're all good. Your rate is set.  * If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage, you'll likely see your payments increase over the next year, depending on how often your rate resets. Keep an eye on mortgage rates and consider moving to a fixed-rate loan. You may want to begin the mortgage shopping process soon if you intend to stay in your home for a few years.  * If you have a home equity line of credit, it's a good time to consider your options. You may want to convert it to a fixed-rate home equity loan, or budget for paying off your line of credit before rates move much higher.  7. Should I worry if I'm shopping for a home?  Buying a home depends on so many different factors "" how much house you can afford, mortgage rates and home prices in your area. Of course, there are also your family's needs, your job situation, the down payment and the rest.  It's hard to time all of that perfectly. But here's the thing: If you're all set to buy, don't let moderately higher mortgage rates worry you. Proceed according to your plan. While the long-term outlook seems to indicate steadily rising interest rates, we're building on very low ground. You know that whole 'historically low mortgage rates' thing you've heard for the past few years? Yeah, we're still there.  It will take a long climb higher before mortgage rates are back to their 44-year historical average of 8%. In the meantime, you'll be in the money with a 4% or 5% home loan. Even a 6% mortgage is a significant discount to the average.  Yes, your buying power can be affected by higher interest rates, but that can also be offset by the better wages and greater employment opportunities of an improving economy.

Sidestep a Tax Hit by Reconstructing IRA Basis,"How can you prove your client has IRA basis (after-tax funds) when it hasnâ€™t been reported to the IRS? If the IRA basis cannot be proved or reconstructed, then those after-tax IRA funds (the basis â€” which should come out tax-free), will be taxed when withdrawn, and this will result in a double tax on those assets. A recent case might provide some insight.

The U.S. Tax Court ruled that hardship distributions from a 401(k) and an IRA were taxable and subject to the 10% early distribution penalty. The court also allowed the IRA owner to claim a portion of his distribution as a tax-free return of basis, even though he had never reported his IRA basis to the IRS. (Gustavo E. Morles v. Commissioner, T.C. Summ. Op. 2015-13, Feb. 23, 2015)
Gustavo Morles was a faculty member of the University of Phoenix and participated in their 401(k) plan. In 2010, he was unemployed and having some financial trouble. He took distributions from both his 401(k) plan and IRA, and used some of that money to pay his rent and avoid eviction.  Morles received a $6,893 distribution from his 401(k) plan in 2010. The plan distribution was reported to him and to the IRS on Form 1099-R, which showed the entire distribution amount as taxable (i.e., there were no after-tax funds). He was under age 59â€‰Â½ at the time of the plan distribution.  PAYING THE RENT  Morles also had a small IRA that he used to pay his rent. His IRA was funded in 2008 with a $1,000 contribution, but he didnâ€™t take a deduction for that contribution on his 2008 federal income tax return. He only had one IRA and never made another IRA contribution or took a distribution before he took a $951 early distribution in 2010. He received a Form 1099-R from the IRA custodian reporting the distribution.  Morlesâ€™ 2010 taxes were done by a paid tax preparer, but neither his 401(k) nor his IRA distribution was reported as income for the year. As a result, the IRS sent him a tax bill for the unreported income.  In a notice of deficiency dated April 2012, the IRS determined that Morles owed $4,789 as a result of his errors. Morles believed the distributions were tax- and penalty-free, and the issue wound up in Tax Court, where Morles represented himself. He argued that neither distribution was taxable because he was suffering economic hardship, including the threat of eviction.  The court ruled that both distributions should be reported as income and that the 10% early distribution penalty applied. It determined that the 401(k) distribution was fully taxable because there were no after-tax funds in the plan. The court also rejected Morlesâ€™ argument that hardship distributions from a company plan are tax-free because he provided no evidence that the tax code offers such treatment â€” probably because it doesnâ€™t.  The IRS believed the entire IRA distribution was taxable, since Morles had never completed a Form 8606 to report his nondeductible IRA contribution. Morles, however, believed it was tax-free because his IRA distribution was less than his initial $1,000 IRA contribution. In his mind, the IRA distribution was nothing more than a tax-free return of his investment. The court allowed the IRA basis and ruled that the IRA distribution was partially taxable and partially tax-free under the  pro-rata tax rule.  Although Morles did not properly report his nondeductible IRA contribution, the court said he could prove that he had basis (after-tax funds) through other means. Furthermore, it indicated that there is nothing in the tax code that explicitly prevents an IRA owner from claiming basis that was not initially reported correctly.  The court noted that Morles did not take a deduction for his IRA contribution at the time it was made. Accordingly, his $1,000 contribution for 2008 was a nondeductible IRA contribution that created basis.  Although Morles only had one IRA that was funded solely by the $1,000 nondeductible contribution, it appears that his IRA had investment gains. Those gains are pretax funds, which are taxable and distributed ratably with his after-tax funds under the pro-rata formula.  Ultimately, the court ordered Morles and the IRS to redo their math and take into account the after-tax funds that were part of his $951 distribution.  The court agreed with the IRS that the 10% penalty applied to both distributions because Morles was under age 59â€‰Â½ at the time. Since his 401(k) distribution was fully taxable, the 10% penalty applied to that entire amount. On the other hand, since the court ruled that Morlesâ€™ IRA distribution was partially tax-free, the 10% penalty only applied to the taxable portion of his distribution.  REPORTING AFTER-TAX AMOUNTS  When after-tax funds are contributed to an IRA, they must be reported on IRS Form 8606. By reporting such amounts, the IRS knows certain funds in the IRA have already been taxed, and cannot be taxed a second time when they are later distributed.  After-tax funds can be added to an IRA in one of two ways: either via nondeductible IRA contributions or via rollovers of after-tax retirement funds that were held in an employer plan, such as a 401(k). Once inside an IRA, after-tax funds can generally only be withdrawn under the pro-rata rule, where each dollar withdrawn is partially taxable and partially tax-free, based on the percentage of after-tax money in the account.  REESTABLISH BASIS  If clients add after-tax money to their IRA during the year, they must file a Form 8606. However, failing to timely file Form 8606 does not automatically mean a client will be unable to claim that a portion of their distribution consists of after-tax funds and thus is nontaxable. Theyâ€™ll just need to find a way to prove how much of their distribution, in fact, comprises after-tax funds.  One way to find any unreported nondeductible contributions is by checking IRA statements. You may also be able to track down Form 5498 (IRA Contribution Information) for prior years, which would show if any IRA contributions were made.  Once you figure out which years your client made contributions, look at the tax return for applicable years to see if a deduction was taken. If you find a year where an IRA contribution was made but no deduction was taken, then you can assume that a nondeductible IRA contribution was made. Note that nondeductible IRA contributions started in 1987, so thereâ€™s no point in going back and scouring statements and returns before that.  Assuming you can prove prior basis, clients may want to file Form 8606 to bring it up to date. Clients should be sure to keep any supporting documentation in case the IRS questions the newly discovered basis.  Advisors can help clients avoid a double tax on IRA basis by checking to see if they made nondeductible IRA contributions and have reported them correctly.  Updating Form 8606 basis information will be helpful to clients and their tax preparers, as well. â€‰  Ed Slott, a CPA in Rockville Centre, N.Y., is a Financial Planning contributing writer and an IRA distribution expert, professional speaker and author of several books on IRAs.

A solid retirement plan that homes in on a RAM,"Dear Mr. Berko: I'm 69, and my wife is 77. We have no debts and no children. After 37 years of working with the same firm, I'm quitting. I don't know how I lasted that long because the company and its owners are not nice to work for. But I have $317,000 to roll over from my 401(k) to an individual retirement account.

A broker we met recommends a list of high-yield stocks paying 12 percent to 18 percent. Another adviser, who counsels retiring employees, says the safest and best investment would be an annuity that right away would pay us $1,479 a month, or $17,748 annually till both of us die. He calls this an immediate annuity because it would begin paying us immediately.
This 401(k) is the only asset we have besides our Social Security and our big house, which is worth $225,000. We're thinking of selling our home and buying a smaller townhouse for $116,000. After paying moving costs, we would have about $100,000 remaining.  We'd invest $60,000 of that cash in those 12 percent to 18 percent stocks, giving us $7,000 to $9,000 annually, and keep $40,000 for emergency cash. My wife and I get $28,000 annually from Social Security. If we could get nearly $18,000 from an annuity plus $7,000 to $9,000 from stocks, that would be the cat's meow.  We need at least $55,000 a year to live on. Any help you could give us would be great. â€“ S.A., Indianapolis  Dear S.A.: Getting a safe 12 percent to 18 percent dependable income on those stocks would be perfect but impossible. Even with highly regarded speculative issues such as Mesabi Trust, Portugal Telecom, TICC Capital, LinnCo, Northern Tier Energy, Calumet Specialty Products Partners or Dominion Resources, that is a big number.  Broker No. 1 knows his high-income stocks, but he also should know these would not be suitable issues for you.  Meanwhile, an immediate annuity is a great idea. But the idiot who's counseling you should go back to annuity school or return to his previous job selling recycled cardiac stents.  There are good annuities and there are bad annuities, and this isn't a good one. It's a high-commission (10 percent) piece of garbage and poorly rated. Given your age and stage, a high-quality immediate annuity would give you two guaranteed lifetime income of $22,000 to $26,000 a year.  Look for such names as Pacific Life, John Hancock, Sun Life Financial, Northwestern Mutual, Protective Life, Thrivent Financial, Axa Equitable, New York Life and Jackson National. They are among the nation's top insurers. I suggest you review several of them and take the highest rate that's offered.  And you don't have to sell your big house. Consider keeping your house and taking out a reverse-annuity mortgage, or RAM.  In this case, the bank would send you a monthly check, which I guesstimate would be somewhere in the neighborhood of $800 to $1,100 a month for the next 827 years or till you both have passed on, whichever comes first.  The precise amount you would get depends on the value of your home and your ages, but that monthly check would be tax-free. And you wouldn't have any liability if your home were to crash in value or be worth enormously less than what you have received.  Indeed, reverse-annuity mortgages are ideal for many retirees, and AARP has some excellent, easy-to-understand reading material about them.  Malcolm Berko is an investment specialist.

Medicaid cuts could take toll on seniors // Half of Minnesotaâ€™s nursing home residents get help through the program.,"The Senate GOP health care bill could lead to cuts in programs that help frail Minnesota seniors and jeopardize many cost-saving services that support caregivers and help seniors stay in their homes. The Senate bill, which could come up for a vote this week, takes a number of steps to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. It also would massively curb federal spending on Medicaid, a 52-year-old social services program that provides matching federal dollars to help states care for the poor, elderly and disabled. Seniors are the fastest-growing group to rely on Medicaid, the nationâ€™s largest source of public health coverage. In Minnesota, seniors account for about 9 percent of the 1.2 million men, women and children covered under the program, which is called Medical Assistance.
 â€œThereâ€™s a lack of awareness that Medicaid is really the safety net in Minnesota for so many of our seniors,â€ said Minnesota Department of Human Services Commissioner Emily Piper, whose agency manages the $11 billion program. The proposed health care bill would end the expansion of Medicaid, allowed under the ACA and implemented by Minnesota. It would also fundamentally change the way states receive federal aid to help care for some of their most vulnerable citizens. The proposal aims to save billions in federal spending by ending open-ended payments to states and establishing a maximum payment on each enrollee. Minnesota would fare worse than most other states because caps are based on medical costs, which are among the lowest in the nation due in part to programs that limit expensive hospital stays and nursing home care. The state is in the process of calculating potential losses under the Senate plan. Under the House bill, which appears to be similar through 2025, the state faces a potential loss of about $2.3 billion in federal funding in the first 18 months and up to $11.4 billion by 2025. Capping federal Medicaid dollars will take needed bloat out of the system and give power back to the states, Republicans backers of the bill argue. But others worry that shifting the burden to states will have an outsized impact on seniors, whose cost of care is growing. â€œItâ€™s not just the seniors who rely on Medicaid, their whole family does,â€ said Piper. â€œTheir adult children, who are working and saving to send their kids to college, or who are raising young children who canâ€™t take on the additional responsibility of providing day-to-day, 24-hour care of aging grandparents.â€ Seventy percent of people over 75 will spend time in a nursing home or need access to long-term care services in their lifetime. Medicare, the governmentâ€™s health insurance for seniors, doesnâ€™t cover assisted living, extended stays in nursing homes or the costs to hire someone to help with cooking, bathing or managing medications for months or years at a time. Thus, Medicaid serves as a safeguard for growing numbers of middle-class elders, particularly those with challenging illnesses such as dementia and heart disease, who rely on the program after theyâ€™ve drained their personal savings. Half of Minnesotaâ€™s nursing home residents are currently covered by Medical Assistance. â€œThe general public thinks of this as an issue for some, and not others,â€ said Jennifer DeCubellis, Hennepin Countyâ€™s deputy commissioner of Health and Human Services. â€œWhat we try to do as a state is provide additional supports to keep people in their homes longer. We know how critical that is to quality of life, for keeping families together. But itâ€™s also an expense for the state. Nursing home care is very expensive.â€ Over the decades, Minnesota has launched a bipartisan effort to get waivers from the federal government to make flexible use of Medicaid dollars to serve seniors in their homes or communities. Those funds now pay for a broad umbrella of services: help with such daily activities as bathing, grooming and toileting; house calls by nurses or case managers to help manage medications; adult day services; meals; transportation to doctorâ€™s appointments; and household chores. Last year, nearly 30,000 Minnesotans were served by the Elderly Waiver program. The state spent an average of $1,300 to $1,600 per person a month, compared to the average monthly cost of a nursing home of $6,700. â€œThe proposed cuts will have an unfortunate impact on the progress weâ€™ve made,â€ said Erin Parrish of AARP Minnesota, citing a recent AARP study that ranked the state No. 2 in care for seniors and their caregivers. â€œThe number of Minnesotans turning 65 this decade will be greater than the past four decades combined. The cap doesnâ€™t keep pace with changing demographics.â€ Minnesota has pushed harder than most other states to try to keep seniors out of institutions. More than three-quarters of the stateâ€™s Medicaid spending for long-term supports and services goes toward programs that seniors get at home or in the community. But these are optional services. Faced with less money, advocates fear the state would be forced to cut back or eliminate these programs. â€œThere arenâ€™t many choices at the state level,â€ said Paula Hart, president and CEO of the Minnesota and Wisconsin chapter of Volunteers of America, which serves more than 8,000 seniors in community settings, affordable housing and group homes. â€œTheyâ€™d really be forced to make a â€˜Sophieâ€™s Choice.â€™ Do you not provide services to people? Do you cut the services they get? Do you cut rates to providers? None of those are good solutions.â€ Informal caregivers likely will feel collateral damage, advocates warn. Family, friends and neighbors provide 92 percent of long-term care needed by older adults in Minnesota, according to the state Department of Human Services. This unpaid care is worth an estimated $7.8 billion a year, more than the state spends on nursing homes and long-term services and supports through Medicaid. â€œIt feels like weâ€™re pulling the rug out from underneath families and seniors,â€ said Kari Thurlow, an executive at LeadingAge Minnesota, which represents senior housing providers. â€œIf we donâ€™t have Medicaid in place, not only will it make it hard for seniors without assets and income to find services, it likely will mean more out-of-pocket expenses for their adult children. Thereâ€™s a trickle-down effect.â€ Organizations that provide senior housing and services say too much already is being balanced on the backs of those who can afford private pay. Federal cuts will make it even more difficult to pay competitive rates for those eldercare workers who provide front-line care for the aged and infirm with complex needs. â€œRight now, you have people in our industry who are hardly making ends meet,â€ said Mary Jo Thorne, a regional director of housing for Augustana Care. â€œBut you get to the point where the provider will say, â€˜I canâ€™t lose money. I canâ€™t do this anymore.â€™ Where will these people go? Thatâ€™s what worries me most.â€ Hennepin Countyâ€™s DeCubellis said the county is prepared to make â€œthe business caseâ€ for continuing to fund programs that keep people out of institutions, even if the menu of Medicaid-eligible services shrinks. Her bigger concern is the politics. â€œMaking the longer-term investment in whatâ€™s right for people and whatâ€™s gong to sustain communities and keep communities and individuals stabilized doesnâ€™t always fit in a short political cycle,â€ she said. Jackie Crosby â€¢ 612-673-7335 Fast facts: Medicaid and Minnesota seniors About 9 percent of all beneficiaries are seniors. They account for about 18 percent of Medicaid spending. Medicaid covers half of all nursing home residents. 77 percent of long-term care spending goes to services that help seniors stay in their homes or communities.

GAME ON We tried 6 savings challenges that saved us hundreds of pounds â€“ hereâ€™s how you could too,"SAVINGS challenges are a great way to get into the habit of putting aside cash â€“ and you could save hundreds of pounds a year.

From the Bingo to Monday to Friday savings, the idea is that you set yourself a challenge based on a set of rules to squirrel away your pennies.
The right one for you will depend on how much you want to save and what you can afford to put aside.  The Sunâ€™s Money team each took on six challenges to find out how they work and crucially how easy they are to stick to.  Combined we managed to tuck away Â£371 in one month.  While some challenges claim to save you hundreds of pounds a year  Brits tucked away more than ever during lockdown as coronavirus measures curbed spending, according to the Office For National Statistics.  But as the rules eased and many face income cuts, saving cash became a bit trickier.  There isnâ€™t a right or wrong way to save.  Where to put your savings  NOW isn't a great time for savers as interest rates are at record low meaning you won't make much money on your cash.  The Bank of England has even hinted that it could take the base rate â€“ what banks and lenders use to set their own interest rates â€“ below zero.  This could see banks and building societies charge savers a fee to hold their cash. Weâ€™ve put together a guide on how to protect your finances if this happens.  For now, here are some examples of the top paying accounts available today:  * Easy-access â€“ You wonâ€™t be charged for withdrawing cash from an easy-access account but typically interest rates are lower to reflect this. The top paying account today is 0.96% with Coventry Building Society.  * Notice savings â€“ Good for those who know theyâ€™ll need to access their cash but not sure when, say for example if youâ€™re saving for a house deposit. You will be able to withdraw your money but you have to give set notice first, say 90 days. The top rate today is 1.12% on an account with DF Captial.  * Fixed-rate â€“ These typically offer better rates but youâ€™ll have to lock away your cash for the agreed term or face paying a penalty to withdraw it early. Here are some examples of the top-rates: â€“ One-year fixed â€“ 1.18% with DF Captialâ€“ Two-year fixed â€“ 1.15% with Aldermoreâ€“ Five-year fixed â€“ 1.5% with UBL UK  * Cash Isa â€“ These are tax-free savings accounts, meaning you get to keep all of the interest earned on savings set aside in a year. This year, the rate is set at Â£20,000. Like savings accounts, there are a number of different types available, such as fixed-rates and easy access. Here are some examples of the top-rates: â€“ Easy-access â€“ 0.96% with Coventry BSâ€“ One-year fixed â€“ 0.82% with Charter Savings Bankâ€“ Two-year fixed â€“ 1% with Cambridge Building Societyâ€“ Five-year fixed â€“ 1.4% with UBL UK  * NS&I Premium Bonds â€“ Instead of being paid interest, Premium Bond savers purchase bonds worth Â£1 each, which are entered into a monthly cash prize draw. Prizes vary from Â£25 to Â£1million but the odds of winning have recently been dramatically reduced, meaning you also run a high risk of earning nothing.  Experts recommend setting up a standing order for a fixed amount to leave your account on payday and then taking a challenge on top.  Moneycomms.co.uk personal finance expert Andrew Hagger said: â€œThe main thing to ask yourself is will your actions save a sufficient amount and can you keep your savings challenge going for the long term?  â€œIn some cases I fear that people may lose interest and give up after a few weeks or months.â€  â€œSometimes these less traditional savings methods are important first steps for new savers who eventually grasp the savings habit and then start to save bigger sums to help them achieve their dreams, for example, for a new car, holiday or house deposit.â€  Thinking of taking on a money challenge? Hereâ€™s our verdict on some of the most popular ones:  Bingo challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: Â£1,200 (if you restart the same card above every month)  * We saved: Â£100  The 2020 bingo challenge helps you put aside Â£1,378 a year by saving a certain amount a week and crossing it off on the board.  It was created to help people who struggle to save easily, but also has flexibility for weeks when you donâ€™t have a lot of spare cash.  You need to find a Bingo card you like and then each week you save one of the amounts.  Our saver says: As the challenge was only for one month I set myself a goal of Â£100 and made my own board by picking random numbers, low and high.  Personally, I needed the visual reminder so stuck it up on my wall â€“ it felt satisfying every time I physically crossed off the numbers too.  The perk of this trick is thereâ€™s no set days that you have to put money aside â€“ just make sure all of the numbers are completed by the end of the month.  It meant on the days I didnâ€™t have any cash to spare I didnâ€™t feel pressured to put any into my savings account.  I averaged around two payments a week and paired a really low amount with one of the higher numbers so I didnâ€™t feel I was being left without.  But I left Â£18 and the Â£7 to the last week, which was quite a push at the end of the month.  Seeing the Â£100 in my bank account was worth it. I would try this again as it turns a chore into a game.  Weather challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: Potentially hundreds  * We saved: Â£95  The idea behind the weather savings challenge is that you put aside an amount equal to whatever the highest temperature is that week.  One degree Celsius is equal to Â£1, so if the temperature reaches 16C that week youâ€™ll need to put Â£16 into savings.  Our saver says:  I never imagined the UK would get soaring temperatures when I picked the weather savings challenge, but there we were in mid-September with a mini-heatwave.  On the upside it did help add extra cash to my savings pot. I set a reminder on my phone to nudge me to save the money, otherwise you could easily forget.  If you do forget (and I did on the last week) you can use a website called timeanddate.com to review temperatures from the previous week.  It would be interesting to do this over a longer period of time and see how it changes seasonally.  I imagine it would be helpful to start in January when the temperatures are low and then build up.  Round up challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: Â£445  * We saved: Â£25.79  Rounding up your purchases to the nearest pound and saving the rest could see you put away an average of Â£1.22 a day â€“ or Â£445.30 a year â€“ according to Which?.  There are plenty of apps and bank services out there that will automatically do this for you, so you donâ€™t have to do the maths.  For example, high street banks, like Halifax, Lloyds, Bank of Scotland, and digital banks, such as Starling and Monzo, let customers switch on this feature within the app.  Our saver says:  I used my existing bank account with Starling to do the round-up challenge.  It was easy to do given the app has a tool that automatically rounds up your transactions and transfers the cash to a separate savings pot.  You donâ€™t really notice the extra pennies on top of each transaction, so itâ€™s a handy way to boost your savings.  Over the course of just over a month, I saved Â£25.79.  Itâ€™s definitely something Iâ€™ll consider carrying on with, although the challenge alone isnâ€™t enough for me to reach my savings targets.  Iâ€™d recommend it as an extra way to save cash or as a test if you feel like you canâ€™t afford to save.  But if youâ€™re saving for something big, such as a property, youâ€™ll need to do more than just round up your purchases or itâ€™ll take a very long time to get a deposit together.  Money saving challenges  IF you'll struggle to save a fiver a day for 100 days before Christmas, why not give a different savings challenge a try instead?  Hereâ€™s a rundown of some of the most popular schemes:  * Weather saving challenge â€“ Save the amount equal to whatever the highest temperature was that week. Â£1 = 1C.  * 1p challenge  â€“ save 1p a day for everyday of the year, but it increase the amount by 1p each day. So day one you save 1p, 2p on day two and 3p on day three. When you reach 100 days you start adding a Â£1 coin each day too, while this increases to a Â£2 coin each day plus pennies at 200 days, and Â£3 each day on top of pennies at day 300.  * 20p a day challenge â€“ Start by putting 20p in savings, then increase the amount by 20p every day. For example, the first week will look like this: 20p, 40p, 60p, 80p, Â£1, Â£1.20, Â£1.40.  * Â£5 a week challenge â€“ Like the 20p challenge, put aside Â£5 a week and increase it by a fiver each week. Eg Â£5, Â£10, Â£15, Â£20  * Round-up challenge  â€“ Every time you buy something, round up the purchase to the nearest Â£1 and put the difference in a savings account. Eg. You pay Â£2.60, so you put 40p in savings. You can use an app such as Monzo or Starling to do this.  * Bingo challenge  â€“ Here you have a bingo card with different numbers on it and you tick them off when youâ€™ve put that amount in your savings account. It can be ad hoc but you have to tick them all off by the end of the month.  * Monday to Sunday  challenge â€“ With this challenge, you simply save Â£1 on Monday, Â£2 on Tuesday and so on until the weekend where you donâ€™t save on Saturday or Sunday.  * 365 day challenge  â€“ Every Sunday you put aside Â£1, followed by Â£2 on Monday, Â£3 on Wednesday and so on. On Saturday youâ€™ll put away Â£7, and then the process repeats and youâ€™ll put aside Â£1 on Sunday as the new week begins.  Monday to Friday challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: Â£780  * We saved: Â£60  If you like having weekends off then the Monday to Friday challenge could be the one for you.  You kick the week off by putting Â£1 into savings and then increasing the amount you put in by Â£1 every day, for example, on Tuesday itâ€™s Â£2 and Wednesday itâ€™s Â£3.  By the end of the week you will have put aside Â£15 in total â€“ then you get Saturday and Sunday off.  Our saver says: Iâ€™m terrible at carrying cash, so I ended up setting up a pot on Monzo after one week when I ran out of physical money.  I wish I could say I remembered to save daily, but I usually ended up forgetting and would make a transfer once a week of how much I should have put away, so Â£15.  I think thatâ€™s quite a lot to put away weekly and Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d have been able to keep up with it over a year.  But over four weeks, I ended up building up Â£60 in my Monzo pot, which I was pretty pleased with.  Give something up challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: Â£489.60  * We saved: Â£40.80  Youâ€™d be surprised at how much those small every day spends add up to â€“ and how much youâ€™d save if you gave them up.  This can be anything from your daily coffee, weekly takeaway or a TV subscription.  Weâ€™ve previously spoken to first-time buyers whoâ€™ve used this method to save hundreds towards the mortgage deposit â€“ but how did it work out for our saver?  Our saver says: Instead of popping in for my morning coffee at the station on the way to work, I made one at home and took it with me in a reusable cup.  Wearing a mask makes it awkward to drink a cup of coffee on the train so sipping my own homemade fix on the walk to the station was simple to adjust to.  Giving up takeaway coffee was also easier because I had already gotten out of the habit of buying them during lockdown.  At Â£2.55 a pop for my usual takeaway Costa coffee â€“ a flat white with almond milk and a 25p discount for bringing my own cup â€“ I saved Â£40.80 this month.  I didnâ€™t squirrel away the money I saved each time but that would be a good idea for anyone struggling to stick to it so they can see the money building up.  I knew I was saving money but adding it up at the end I was surprised just how much because it felt like small amounts each time.  Add Â£5 a week challenge  * Yearly estimated saving: Â£650  * We saved: Â£50  Stick to the add Â£5 a week challenge and you could end up with a tidy Â£50 in your savings account â€“ thatâ€™s if you manage to keep with it.  Like the Monday to Friday challenge, you increase the amount that goes into savings as time goes on, in this case you add a fiver on every week.  Starting at Â£5 in the first week, increase it to Â£10 in the second, Â£15 in the third and Â£20 in the final week.  You then reset it every month to keep the amount you put into savings affordable.  Our saver says: This savings challenge really didnâ€™t work for me.  Because the amount you squirrel away increases each week it means you canâ€™t set-up a weekly direct debit to siphon off the money directly into your savings account to stop you spending it and I would never remember to do this manually.  I also rarely carry cash so it wasnâ€™t simply a case of putting aside the money into a piggy bank each week.  Iâ€™ve instead set-up a monthly direct debit to add an affordable set amount to a Stocks and Shares Isa each month.",1
Donâ€™t buy a new car without these documents in hand; Itâ€™s important to be prepared,"Itâ€™s important to be prepared

Youâ€™ve done your research, checked your credit reports to make sure theyâ€™re accurate, and youâ€™re ready to get serious about buying a car. You feel more than ready to sign on the dotted line and drive home in your new ride.
It could happen. Or, you could drive home in your old vehicle, kicking yourself for having forgotten one of the documents you need to complete the purchase. Hereâ€™s how to lay the groundwork for getting the deal done on the day youâ€™re ready to buy.  Four steps to prepare to buy a car  Step 1:  Youâ€™ll want to talk to your insurance agent about what it will cost to insure the make and model you are considering buying. You donâ€™t want that figure to be a surprise, and you also want to find out how soon you will need to notify your insurer you have the new vehicle.  Step 2:  Talk to your bank or credit union and get preapprovedÂ for the loan youâ€™ll needâ€”and do this close to your planned purchase date. You may get something resembling a blank check (up to a certain maximum) that must be signed by you and the dealer. By getting preapproved, you will know the total loan amount and interest rate you qualify for. Even if you plan to finance at the dealer, it canâ€™t hurt to come in with a preapproval; you are far less likely to agree to a longer term or higher interest rate because you really want to drive that new car home today. It can also help you stay within your budget by serving as a solid reminder of how much you planned to spend and how long you were willing to make payments â€” before the showroom floor made it so hard to remember.  Step 3:  Make sure you have your driverâ€™s license and proof of auto insurance with you. You shouldnâ€™t be driving without these documents anyway.  Step 4:  Obvious as this seems, be sure you have a way of funding your down payment. If itâ€™s not cash, make sure the dealer accepts the form of payment youâ€™re planning to use. (If you forget to do this, you would not be the first, but that would be little consolation.)  Expert Tip:Â Be cautious about having your credit pulled unnecessarily. Each inquiry made for the purpose of extending credit can cause a small, temporary decrease in your credit score. And while inquiries for the purpose of getting a car loan made in a two-week period should count as only one entry, weâ€™ve heard from consumers who have told us their credit scores dropped as the result of multiple auto loan inquiries. Some dealerships now ask customers to fill out a credit application even before a test drive, and there are reports that some have checked credit without customer consent. It can help to keep an eye on your credit through this process for this reason. Hard inquiries into your credit require permission, and it can be illegal for your credit to beÂ pulled without your approvalÂ in this manner.  Can you purchase a car with a credit card?  Speaking of your down payment, you may have wondered if this can be charged to a credit card â€” or if the entire car can be paid that way. The answer is yes and no. It is possible that the dealership will not accept a credit card payment for the car, as this can come with large merchant fees that lower their profits. However, if your credit is in good standing, then it is still possible.  A better option would be toÂ use your credit card for just the down payment. Not only is this better for your credit, since using all of your available $10,000â€“$15,000 credit limit can damage your credit score, but itâ€™s more likely to be accepted by the dealer.  Also read: Why buying a 10-year-old car is a savvy move  Finally, youâ€™ll want to use aÂ credit card that has excellent benefits.Â An appropriate credit card can earn you big rewards on your car purchase or other auto-related purchases.  Planning to trade in your car? donâ€™t forget these items for the dealership  If you plan to trade in a car, you have a bit more to do.  You will need to bring the following items to the dealership:  Your carâ€™s certificate of title (If it has gone missing, your state department of motor vehicles can tell you how to get it replaced.)  The carâ€™s current registration  Your car keys and the ownerâ€™s manual  Your account number or a payment stub if you still have a car loan (Weâ€™re going to hope that if this is the case, your car is worth more than you owe.)  A clean car, paying special attention to areas out of sight but convenient for stashing things: under seats, over the visors, in the glovebox and in every corner of the trunk  Besides a new car, expect to come home with a good bit of paperwork. Pay special attention to the purchase and sale agreement. You will need the information there to get or update your insurance â€” and you might even need it at tax time next year if you bought a car that qualifies for a tax credit.  What do I need to apply for an auto loan?  While you wonâ€™t need to drive all the way to a dealership to get an auto loan (you can simply apply online), you will still need someÂ important documentsÂ in front of you to easily fill out the application.  Hereâ€™s what you need:  Proof of identity through an ID or passport  Your credit report, which the lender can pull using your name, address, date of birth and social security number  A valid state-issued driverâ€™s license  Proof of monthly income through pay stubs or social security income receipts  Proof of residence through mortgage statements or utility bills  Contact information for personal references (note: this may not be required)  Vehicle make and model  Proof of car insurance  Payment type (cash, credit, debit, etc.)  Your carâ€™s registration if you are trading in the vehicle  The list is rather long, but having each document will speed up the process and prevent you from going back and forth between your files.  See: Do this before buying a car, it could save you a bundle  Make sure that you can qualify for an auto loan by checking your free credit score. From there, you can apply for your auto loan with confidence and compare credit cards that can help you finance your new car.  Frequently asked questions  Will my credit rating affect my auto insurance rates?  You should choose auto insurance coverage based on your credit rating and overall coverage needs.  How can I find a credit card with a low interest rate to charge my car purchase?  We donâ€™t recommend that you put your entire purchase onto your credit card, but there areÂ cards with low APRÂ or no APR for up to 15 months available to compare. If you can pay off the remaining balance during this period, then these credit cards may be for you.  How good should my credit be to get a credit card that is appropriate for a car purchase?  Many of the best rewards credit cards with high credit limits require good or excellent credit. AÂ good credit score is considered 700â€“749 and anything over 750 is considered excellent.  You mentioned that hard inquiries can affect my credit score. What is a hard inquiry?  A hard inquiry is a credit check that indicates you have applied for credit, usually through a loan. Each time a hard inquiry is pulled from a different lender, your credit score can drop by up to 10 points, because it indicates that a lender has reviewed your credit and that you are trying to open up a new line of credit.

Education Secretary calls for an end to 'low value' degrees,"Thousands of students are being let down by universities providing poor value degrees, the Education Secretary has warned.

Damian Hinds is calling on institutions to drop or revamp courses delivering poor value for money.
It comes as Department for Education (DfE) analysis suggests that on more than one in 10 of all courses there is a 75% chance graduates will not be earning enough five years after leaving university to start repaying student loans.  According to the official graduate outcomes for 2015 to 2016 data, the percentage of courses where the repayment threshold is not met after five years varies from subject to subject.  Graduates must start repaying their loans when they earn Â£25,000 or over - a threshold that was raised by the Government in April 2018.  Mr Hinds is urging prospective students to use all the data available to them to make sure they are choosing a course and institution that is right for them.  The DfE analysis identified around 20 providers where at least three quarters of all students are still not earning enough to start repaying their loans five years after graduation.  Mr Hinds believes the figures should be a wake-up call for universities about their responsibility to deliver the best outcome for students.  He said: ""The opportunity to study at university should be open to anyone with the talent and potential to benefit from higher education.  ""With students and taxpayers sharing the cost of higher education it's right that we challenge those institutions which could appear to be more focused on 'getting bums on seats' than getting students into high quality courses worth paying for.  ""That's why I want universities to be brave and ask themselves if they're running courses that really help students gain the skills they need for the workforce of tomorrow - if they're not they should improve them or end them.  ""But if universities think other options like apprenticeships or technical education are a better fit for a student, they should give young people that advice rather than put them on a course that isn't providing what they need for a bright future.""  The DfE says around 45% of the value of outstanding post-2012 student loans are not expected to be repaid, coming at a significant cost to the taxpayer.  Mr Hinds said it is not right that institutions benefit from student loan funded fee income for delivering poor value courses, as students and taxpayers are the ones that suffer.",1
Medicare Part B Premiums Climb for 2020,"High-income retirees will experience the biggest changes.

Medicare beneficiaries, expect to pay more for coverage next year. The Medicare Part B premium is rising, and high-income retirees will see a spike in income-related charges for 2020. But for the first time in a decade, inflation adjustments have changed the income thresholds for those charges, mitigating the pain for some high-income beneficiaries.
SEE ALSO: Retirees, Avoid These 11 Costly Medicare Mistakes  The standard monthly premium for Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient services, jumps nearly 7% for 2020, to $144.60. New Medicare enrollees, those who don't get Social Security benefits and those who are directly billed for Part B premiums are automatically subject to the standard premium.  Other Medicare beneficiaries may not get the full wallop of that premium increase. Given the 1.6% cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits in 2020, some Medicare beneficiaries will be protected by the ""hold harmless"" provision. That provision keeps many beneficiaries' Part B premium increase from exceeding the increase in their Social Security benefits if premiums are automatically deducted from benefits.  But about 7% of beneficiaries will pay more than the standard premium: High-income beneficiaries don't benefit from the hold-harmless provision and instead pay a monthly income-related adjustment on top of the standard Part B premium. These beneficiaries also pay a surcharge on their Part D prescription-drug plan premiums.  The good news for some high-income beneficiaries: For the first time since 2011, the income thresholds determining the 2020 surcharges are adjusted for inflation. Surcharges don't start to kick in until single taxpayers have more than $87,000 of modified adjusted gross income (AGI plus tax-exempt interest), which is $2,000 more than the threshold that applied for the past 10 years, or until married taxpayers filing jointly have more than $174,000 of MAGI, $4,000 more than in recent years. There's one exception to the inflation adjustments: The top fifth tier, which was new for 2019, remains the same and applies to singles with MAGI of $500,000 or more and joint filers with MAGI of $750,000 or more.  The not-so-good news? The total Part B premium for those subject to surcharges is climbing by nearly 7% across all the tiers. The first tier's total premium, for instance, rises from $189.60 in 2019 to $202.40 for 2020.  SEE ALSO: 7 Things Medicare Doesn't Cover  Part D surcharges, however, are dropping slightly. For example, those in the first tier will pay $12.20 on top of their plan premium in 2020, which is 20 cents less than 2019. Those in the fourth tier will pay an extra $70, a 90-cent drop from 2019.  Of course, the biggest savings will go to those who fall into a lower tier because of the inflation adjustments. For instance, let's say your MAGI is $135,000 as a single. In 2019, you are in the third tier paying a Part D surcharge of $51.40, whereas in 2020, you fall into the second tier and owe a Part D surcharge of $31.50--a savings of nearly 39%. The total Part B premium would fall about 18% with that same switch in tiers, to $289.20 in 2020.  Check Eligibility for Surcharge Waiver  Medicare premium surcharges are based on information from your tax return two years prior. If your circumstances have changed since you filed that return, you might qualify for a surcharge waiver.  The federal government provides relief as a result of certain life-changing events, such as death of a spouse or retirement, which can qualify you to use your current, lower income and avoid the surcharge. You can learn more at www.socialsecurity.gov.  If you experienced one of those events since your 2018 tax return was filed, you can file Form SSA-44 with the Social Security Administration and provide the appropriate documentation, such as a letter from your former employer noting your retirement.  If you had a one-time spike in income, such as a large profit from the sale of a house, you're out of luck on escaping the surcharges. But Medicare premiums are determined annually, and the surcharge will drop off in 2021 if your 2019 income falls below the surcharge income thresholds.  SEE ALSO: Does Medicare Cover That?

Student Loans Company calls on students to prepare for payment,"The Student Loans Company is urging students to get ready for the first payment of the new academic year.

During September approximately 1.25M students across the UK will receive Maintenance Loans from the Student Loans Company supporting them to access opportunities in higher and further education.
With the new academic year set to start, SLC is urging students to get ready for the first payment by following its top tips:  Complete your online application - it sounds obvious but some students, especially those who have gone through clearing, may not have applied for funding yet and should make sure they do this as soon as possible. The easiest way to apply is online at www.gov.uk/studentfinance.  Register at your college or university payments are made to students on the first official day of their course, but only if their attendance on their course has been registered, Students should follow the registration guidance provided by their university or college. It can take up to three days for payments to reach a students account so they should also make sure they have money to cover initial costs, such as books, transport or their first months rent.  Make sure you have provided up-to-date bank details often when a student goes to college or university they open a new bank account. Its important that they update their online student finance account with the new details to ensure their money goes to the right place.  Provide any evidence you have been asked for as soon as possible - parents and partners may also be asked to provide financial information and evidence. They should do this through their own online account which they can set up on GOV.UK.  Follow Student Finance Englands Facebook and Twitter channels - look out for details of our Facebook Live sessions which give students the opportunity to put their questions to our team of student finance experts.  SLCs Executive Director of Operations, Derek Ross said:  The team at SLC will be working hard over the next month to ensure that students receive their funding at the start of term. Students can help ensure the process is as smooth as possible by following our advice. There is lots of information available on our payment page and on our social media channels to help students and their parents get prepared.  The National Association of Student Money Advisers (NASMA) added:  We here at NASMA know what an exciting time this is for new students starting on the next stage of their educational journey.

ON THE MONEY: Converting to a Roth in stages,"It has become abundantly clear that a Roth IRA is, in many ways, superior to a traditional IRA.

Once you get past the lack of deductibility of contributions to a Roth, the other tax benefits of a Roth are inescapable.
Consider that a Roth IRA can be a source of recurring tax-free income (without the need for nettlesome required minimum distributions) or could serve as a safety net when you need some extra funds.  A Roth can also be part of your tax-free legacy to your heirs, since the distributions that they take from the account are not taxable, and the monies in the Roth continue to enjoy tax-free growth.  The tax free growth does not last forever though, since a Roth beneficiary must begin taking RMDs by Dec. 31 of the year after the owner's death.  When an owner withdraws income from a Roth IRA, the distributions are not considered as part of gross income, thus not raising taxable income; and when one's income is lower, good things happen tax-wise:  You do not have to pay a 3.8 percent tax on investment income.  In some cases, there will be less tax on your Social Security benefits.  You may pay lower Medicare premiums.  You may be eligible for larger medical expense deduction.  You will not be subjected to a loss of itemized deductions or personal exemptions.  So then why doesn't every taxpayer convert his or her traditional IRA to a Roth?  Simple - the entire amount of the conversion is included in your taxable income for that year. There are also some potential downsides to a Roth conversion:  The government could enact legislation to change the tax code and make Roth IRA's less favorable. That was the case during the Obama administration when then-President Obama kicked up some dust by suggesting Roth distributions should be taxable.  Your tax rate in retirement could go down instead of up and that would mean that a conversion at today's higher rates would be a bad bargain.  The Roth's investments could go down in value instead of up (meaning you paid tax on value you didn't get).  You might someday need the cash that you pay to the IRS to pay for the conversion.  Rather than attempting to eat the entire elephant in one fell swoop, it may pay to consider converting to a Roth in increments, rather than all at once.  For example, if your taxable income is low in a given year, it could be advantageous to simply convert enough of your taxable IRA so that the additional income you will have to include would not thrust you into a higher tax bracket.  As an example, if a married retired couple had a taxable income of $65,000 of taxable income for 2020, they would be in the 12% marginal tax bracket.  Since the 12% bracket phases out at $80,250 this year, they could convert $15,250 from their traditional IRA to a Roth in 2020 without propelling themselves into the 22% tax bracket.  This technique would be particularly appealing if the couples' future RMDs will place them in a higher bracket down the road. Taking this incremental approach this year could lower those future RMDs enough to avoid a higher bracket later.  If your spouse is in failing health, remember that when one spouse dies, the survivor often finds him or herself in a much higher single filer income tax bracket even though the income of the surviving partner hasn't increased.  It may make sense for married couple to consider this possibility and do a Roth conversion before a death occurs.  Another effective incremental strategy is to convert shares of stock that are currently undervalued but are likely to go up in the future.  Assume that you have Google stock that is currently worth $25,000, but you believe that the stock will double in the next two or three years.  The strategy would be to move the actual stock from the traditional IRA to a Roth IRA, thus paying income tax today on the lower price.  The future expected appreciation in the stock will escape taxation in the Roth. And yes, you may convert specific assets in a traditional IRA to a Roth.",1
Investing advice from Vince Lombardi,"Vince Lombardi's famous ""Number One"" soliloquy epitomizes the way you should look at your investment portfolio. Lombardi said, ""There is no room for second place. There is only one place in my game, and that's first place. ...There is a second place bowl game, but it is a game for losers played by losers.""

Your investment strategy should embrace similar selection criteria, only the best with judicious attention being paid to profitability and intrinsic value. Keep in mind we are talking about investing and not trading, which is simply a polite word for speculation.
A Wall Street trader/speculator portrays a striking resemblance to a Las Vegas gambler; they both want to profit by successfully picking the correct outcome of a random event. An investor minimizes risk through diligent research and the utilization of a longer time horizon.  Time is the critical factor. Trying to forecast short-term trends on Wall Street is like trying to herd cats, a great idea but one with little probability of success. Being patient alleviates market volatility and enables you to benefit from a continual compounding of earnings.  A good example of a company that has the potential to reward investor patience is Verizon (VZ). Having completed its acquisition of AOL in late June of this year, the stated reason for the purchase was the leveraging of Verizon's network with AOL's strength in advertising, video and mobile.  Verizon also plans for AOL to contribute to its ""Internet of Things"" platform, a technology that helps Web-enabled devices communicate and coordinate with one another. The conjecture is that AOL's ad technology platform was at the heart of Verizon's attraction for AOL.  Verizon's attractiveness to investors is the predictability of its revenue and earnings growth, which have consistently allowed Verizon to raise its dividend yield over the past five years at an annualized rate of 2.93 percent. Moreover, Verizon's growth strategy and the de-leveraging of its balance sheet has removed most speculation as to the long-term viability of Verizon's dividend and capital return program going forward.  Based on the most recent quarterly earnings report, Verizon appears to have considerably more pricing leverage than initially anticipated, driven by adoption of 4G LTE devices and growth in retail prepaid connections. (4G means the fourth generation of data technology for cellular networks. LTE stands for Long Term Evolution and is short for a very technical process enabling high-speed data transmission for phones and other mobile devices.)

Ohio has the most student debt in the country,"Ohio University ; Athens, OH - news

By Sarah M. Penix
Going to school in Ohio may be more expensive in the long run for students.  Ohio has the most student debt in the country, according to a study conducted by WalletHub, a personal finance website, in August. Ohio is also among the top 10 states for the average amount of student debt and the amount of students in debt.  Two-thirds of students in the state have debt, and the average debt is $30,239 per student. Ohio University's annual tuition is about $25,000 for in-state students and about $34,000 for out-of-state students.  Combined with the highest student debt in the country, Ohio holds a low home ownership rank for people from ages 25 to 34. Illinois, Washington, D.C., Vermont, Tennessee and Georgia also fall under the category of high student debt and low home ownership.  The percent of OU students who graduate with debt is on par with the stateâ€™s ratio of two-thirds, though the average debt is about $2,500 less than the state average. OU ranks 36th out of 48, with 48 being the university with the lowest student debt when comparing the mean of student debt among Ohio colleges and universities.

"TAX TIPS \ As tax deadline nears, here's five tax tips you should take note of:","RRSP contributions

RRSP contributions are subtracted from your taxable income, making for one of the best tax breaks available to you.
Make sure you know your contribution limit and stay within it.  Moving expenses  If you need to move more than 40 km for work, you can claim:  * Transportation and storage costs  * Travel expenses (including gas and food)  * Up to 15 days temporary accommodation If you sell your home, you can also claim:  * Legal fees  * Taxes on transfer of title  * Cost of selling your old home  Keep all of your receipts as moving claims are often reviewed.  Childcare expenses  Includes:  * Daycare  * Babysitting  * Boarding school  * Certain camp fees  Parents can claim up to $7,000 per year for children under 7 years of age, $4,000 per year for children aged 7 to 16 and $10,000 per year for disabled children.  Expenses can usually only be claimed by the lower-income spouse.  Charitable donations  You receive a 15% federal tax credit for the first $200 and 29% for any amount over that. Combined with the provincial tax savings, you could receive almost 50% of your donations in tax savings.  Bonus for first time donors: With the First Time Donors Super Credit, you'll receive a $512 federal tax credit if you donate $1,000.  Business expenses  Claiming business expenses helps lower your taxable income -but they must be reasonable.  If you work from home, you are able to claim items related to your home office. If you are claiming a vehicle, for example, you must have a logbook to record your business mileage versus personal use.  Credit card slips or statements are not enough -you need an itemized receipt for any expenses you claim.",1
Fund managers are still laughing all the way to the bank;Comment;Opinion;M oney,"WARREN BUFFETT says you should ""be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful"" if you want to get rich. But it isn't easy to buck your instincts when you're afraid of losing your job or worrying about how to pay the mortgage next month.

According to the Irish Banking Federation, which published its annual Personal Asset Profile survey last week, fear is on the rise as more of us opt for lower-risk savings and investments. Nearly 60% of respondents said that ""risk"" was playing a greater part in their decision-making, compared with just 48% of people in 2007.
With both property and equity markets doing so badly, it comes as no surprise that people are opting for ""safer"" capital-guaranteed or deposit products - although ""safe"" is a relative term when inflation and Dirt are ravaging the real spending power of your savings. Given how more than one third of the respondents admitted to not having a clue about the products they have invested in or the actual return (or loss) they are getting, and that a third never bother to review their holdings, decision-making seems to have been driven up to now more by ignorance than risk-driven fear.  Surveys like this, which highlight how ignorant we really are about money, must be very comforting for bankers, who are offering ever larger suites of deposit accounts that they flog as ""safe"" destinations for money. Based on these results, they probably won't have to field too many awkward questions about the devastating impact that inflation and tax has on returns.  Even investment fund providers, whose customers are taking a hammering, must be heartened by the large number of people who admit that they haven't got a clue what their funds are worth. Long live their ignorance, the fund managers must be saying.  After all, who else but an innocent would buy or keep paying into a policy or fund in which the fund provider and manager keep collecting huge upfront and continuing fees even when they are steadily losing your money. If you do finally realise what's happening and want to cash out, the same manager may impose sneaky exit penalties, called a ""market value adjustor"", that can be as high as 10% of your already loss-making fund, and there's nothing you can do about it.  The truth is that if we really understood how to gauge risks and rewards, we probably wouldn't leave our money with bankers and fund managers at all.  (C) Times Newspapers Ltd, 2008 ",1
Looking Ahead  ,"You've filed your 2005 tax return. Did you get the desired results? Did you lower your tax bill? Tax planning works best when it begins early in the year. The following strategies and new opportunities offer immense benefits for your 2006 tax return, if you act now:  
* Apply a Bunching Strategy. Are your itemized deductions less that 150 percent of the standard deduction? If so, consider a bunching strategy, where you apply the standardized deduction one year, and itemize deductions the following year. In the itemized deduction year, consider paying two years' worth of property taxes and making multi-year payments for other expenses. Consider, too, paying for business items and professional development expenses during an itemized year to reduce lost itemized deductions based on adjusted gross income. Remember, though, that paying additional property tax and taking more miscellaneous deductions in one year could subject you to the Alternative Minimum Tax. Don't overlook annual miscellaneous expenses, such as investment journal subscriptions, safe deposit box rentals, and brokerage fees for taxable investment accounts.    * Evaluate 2006 Tax Credits. Tax credits for 2006 residential energy property expenditures range from $50 for an advanced main air circulation fan, to $300 for any energy-efficient building property item. Buyers qualify for tax credits ranging from $400 to $3,400 for new hybrid vehicles purchased after January 1, 2006. Tax credit considerations include vehicle weight, fuel economy, and lifetime fuel savings.    * Fund IRA/401(K) Plans. Everyone should set aside as much as possible for retirement funding. For a 401(k) plan, contribute enough to fully benefit from an employer's matching funds, and try to make the maximum $15,000 contribution. Individuals 50 years old or older can add ""catch up"" contributions up to $5,000. Self-employed individuals should establish self-employed retirement plans. The new Roth 401(k) plans give younger employees in lower tax brackets a great way to get long-term, tax-free appreciation. High school or college-age children with part-time job income can also contribute up to $4,000, or the amount they earned, to a Roth IRA.    * Capitalize on FSA Rule Changes. The IRS recently approved a grace period until March 15 for employees to use the previous year's Flexible Spending Account funds. A recent IRS ruling allows fund reimbursements for a number of over-the-counter items, including antacids and cold tablets, as well as weight loss or smoking cessation aids. Some reimbursements may require a doctor's approval.    * Consider Gifts to Individuals. The annual gift tax exclusion for 2006 was raised to $12,000 per individual. Gifting enables you to transfer investments to a child or someone else who is in a lower tax bracket. A child younger than 14 years old can have an unearned (investment) income of $1,700 for 2006, before subjecting parents to the ""kiddie tax"" rules. The first $850 is tax free, with the next $850 subject to a 10 percent tax bracket.    * Be Tax-Wise in Charitable Giving. Giving appreciated stock enables you to make a valuable charitable contribution without paying capital gains tax on that stock. When donating a used car, inquire whether the charity will sell the car, or use it for charitable activities. The latter may yield a bigger deduction. For a sale, the price the charity gets is the donated value. Bank-issued credit cards can also be used to make charitable contributions, even if the card balance isn't paid until 2007.    * Coordinate Capital Gains/Losses.    You are limited to $3,000 in annual net losses. Try to offset short-term gains against short-term losses so that when you sell stocks with long-term capital gains, they are taxed at the 15 percent tax bracket. Also, take deductions for investment interest when you are taking the deduction against short-term capital gains, rather than long-term capital gains, which are taxed at 15 percent.    * Avoid Penalties for Underpaying Estimates. If penalized for underpaying estimated taxes, increase your withholding tax or estimated tax payments.    * Invest in a 529 College Savings Plan. If you are saving for a child's or grandchild's college education, contribute to a 529 college savings plan. The contributions are treated as annual gifts, up to $12,000 per beneficiary. If you exceed that annual amount, you can elect on a gift tax return to take the contributions into account ratably over five years, as long as the five-year total per beneficiary does not exceed $60,000. ($120,000 for you and your spouse). Earnings are tax free when used for qualifying educational expenses.    Get Started...Now!    The benefits you'll see next tax season from implementing tax-saving strategies now will be significant. Over years and decades, those benefits compound in value. So, what are you waiting for?

Obama calls for higher standards on brokers giving retirement advice ,"President Obama called on the Department of Labor to crack down on the ""backdoor payments"" and ""hidden fees"" paid to brokers giving retirement advice.

The president endorsed a new rule proposed by the Labor Department on Monday that would increase the standards for brokers who recommend investments for retirement accounts, requiring brokers to have the client's best interests in mind.
Under more stringent ""fiduciary"" standards, brokers would need to justify if they are recommending a security that is more expensive than other options available or that may be underperforming, retirement experts say. Current rules only require that the investment be ""suitable,"" which doesn't place as much emphasis on cost and performance.  The president endorsed the tighter standards at a press event at AARP on Monday, stressing that excessive fees hurt middle class families who are trying to improve their long-term security by saving for retirement. ""You should have the peace of mind of knowing that the advice you're getting for investing those dollars is sound,"" he said.  The proposed rule is expected to be published in several months, after receiving approval from the White House's Office of Management and Budget. It would then be published and subject to public comments.  The exact details of the proposed rules won't be available until the Labor Department's announcement in a few months, but the changes are targeting Individual Retirement Accounts, which hold more than $7 trillion in savings for more than 40 million Americans.  An estimated $1.7 trillion of IRA assets are invested in products that provide payments that lead to conflicts of interest, according to research released Monday by the White House Council of Economic Advisers.  Weak consumer protections cost IRA investors up to $17 billion a year in excessive fees, the report said. Administration officials say the new rules would not eliminate commission payments.  ""Numerous studies have found that some advisers consistently steer customers to high fee products despite the fact that high fee products don't perform any better,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren during the AARP event.  The new rules are expected to generate strong resistance from financial institutions, which argue the added restrictions could make it more difficult for savers to get potentially useful advice. ""This re-proposal could make it harder to save for retirement by cutting access to affordable advice and limiting options for savers,"" said Kenneth E. Bentsen,president of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.  Brian Graff, executive director of the National Association of Plan Advisers, said the new rules may force savers to end long-standing relationships with advisers. The change could make it harder for savers to roll their savings into an IRA, where they may benefit from having more investment options than they do in a 401(k) plan, even if some of those options are more expensive, he says.  The Labor Department tried to adjust the standards for retirement advisers in 2010 but withdrew the proposal after receiving strong resistance from the financial industry. White House and Labor Department officials made it clear that these new rules would not ban commissions.  There are three main conflicts that can exist when a person receives advice from a broker, according to a White House memo leaked to the news media last month. Some investors are encouraged to roll over assets from a 401(k) plan into an IRA, without receiving warning that the fees they incur in the new plan may be higher than what they were previously paying. Some brokers receiving payments when investors buy a certain fund or security, may recommend that clients buy and sell those products more often than needed, causing them to pay those fees repeatedly and unnecessarily.  Other advisers attempt to justify their fees by recommending that clients use actively managed funds. But when those funds underperform low-cost index funds, investors are stuck with a double whammy of lower returns and higher investment costs.  The council estimates these conflicts reduce investment returns by 1 percentage point each year, which could reduce savings by more than a quarter over 35 years. Put another way, a $10,000 investment would normally grow to more than $38,000 over that time period, after adjusting for inflation, would instead be worth $27,500.  A typical worker who rolls over a 401(k) to an IRA at age 45 will lose an estimated 17 percent from her account by age 65. For someone with $100,000 in retirement savings, receiving conflicted advice could limit growth to $179,000 by age 65â€”a loss of $37,000 when compared to someone not receiving that conflicting advice.  ""You could end up with tens of thousands of dollars less simply because your adviser isn't required to put your best interests first,"" said Jeff Zients, director of the White House National Economic Council.  Some investors may not be aware of the conflicting interests that could encourage their advisers to steer them into costly products or to make moves that could leave them with a loss. A 2013 survey of retirement savers by AARP found that about 50 percent of respondents were ""less likely"" to trust their plan providers after learning that advice they offer is not currently required to be in their best interest.  ""Most of the general public has no idea that there are different kinds of advisers or different kinds of standards,"" says David Certner,Â legislative policy director for the AARP. ""Most of them assume that the advisers are working in their best interest.""  Once the Labor Department issues the proposed rules, investors will get a chance to submit comments in writing and in a public hearing. After reviewing the feedback, the administration will decide what to include in a final rule, which will not go into effect immediately after it's finalized.

THE CREDIT SPIES MAKING MILLIONS OUT OF WATCHING YOUR EVERY MOVE,"PETER and Judith Lewis have never had any money troubles. They've paid off their mortgage, promptly meet any bills, and never run up debts.

So, when they decided to switch to a better current account deal last month, they expected the move to be plain sailing.
But the couple were left humiliated when Nationwide called and said they had been turned down: their custom was not welcome. They were told a bad debt was to blame.  Mr Lewis, 70, a retired flight engineer, says: 'We had never been turned down for anything before. I couldn't understand what had happened.'  They pleaded with Nationwide to find out what had gone wrong. Finally, they were advised to check their credit report. When it arrived, it showed they had failed to repay Â£336 on a Nationwide credit card in 2008.  Mr Lewis say: 'The record was simply not right. We'd been victims of fraud while on holiday in Australia and the card had been cancelled. I rang the credit reference company and said: ""You've libelled me."" We were so angry with them.  'Had we needed a mortgage, we couldn't have got one. We felt we were blamed for something that wasn't our fault.'  Credit reports, and the agencies that compile these records, have taken over our lives. They hold data on every adult in the UK and use this information to rack up vast profits. So powerful are these firms, it is impossible to move home, change mobile phone or switch current account without their say so.  But when the information held by the credit agencies is wrong, the effects can be devastating. What's more, the information can prove almost impossible to change.  THE BIG NAMES THAT RULE YOUR LIFE  The three main credit reference agencies in Britain are Experian, Callcredit and Equifax, who put together huge databases of information supplied by banks, energy companies and mobile phone firms.  On top of this, they add details such as where you live, which they take from the electoral roll. The idea is that this gives a complete picture of how you spend your money, what your habits are and how good you are at repaying debts.  Firms pay the agencies to see this data. They can then use it, along with their own information, to make decisions about whether to accept you as a customer.  Your details are worth a fortune.  Experian is a FTSE 100 company with headquarters in Dublin and offices in Nottingham. Last year, it took revenues of Â£539 million in the UK (up from Â£479 million in 2011). It had no UK corporation tax bill, and instead got a credit of Â£159 million from the Treasury. It said the tax credit related to losses racked up in previous years.  Equifax, which is based in the U.S., in Atlanta, Georgia, reported that revenues from the UK increased by 6 pc last year to Â£87 million.  Callcredit, which was founded by Skipton Building Society but is now owned by a private equity firm, saw its operating profits jump by 40 pc last year to Â£17.3 million.  A real money-spinner for the firms is the masses of information they hold on you: everything from whether you have claimed on your insurance policies to the kind of savings account you use.  Callcredit boasts it holds the personal details of 43 million people. This includes 26 million residential addresses, 20 million landline numbers and 15 million mobile numbers.  Among the data it may know about you are the ages of your children, the angle of your garden (useful information for firms that sell solar panels or satellite dishes), whether you have a burglar alarm fitted, the make and mileage of your car, how much you spend on wine, sports and vitamins, if you gamble, where you go on holiday and what you read.  These details aren't on your credit file but are collected because they're a gold mine for any company that wants to sell you something.  These personal details are then sold to marketing companies by middle-men called data resellers. Callcredit says that 95 pc of all data resellers use its service. A further chunk of profits comes from selling complex computer programs to businesses, allowing them to interpret the details in your credit report. These programs are what bank staff use when you apply for a loan.  Not only do they allow them to decide whether to lend to you, but they can also indicate whether you will be a profitable customer.  Experian sells a program that alerts your bank if you are likely to need more credit in the near future. Based on this, the banks will be able to flog you a new credit card or loan.  Equifax uses your data to allow insurers to see if you may be a risky customer. It has a similar service for energy suppliers â€” allowing them to highlight anyone whose record shows that they had failed to repay a bill. All three firms run tracing services to track down people who have defaulted on bills.  A final money-making ploy is to get you to subscribe to see your file. By law, credit reference firms must give you your credit report for Â£2 by post, or Â£4 over the phone. The agencies say they don't make money from these reports.  They show just a very basic list of your current address, any financial agreements you have, your credit limits, and whether you have repaid on time dating back over the past six years.  But the agencies also encourage you to sign up to services that claim to let you analyse your file and improve it by taking out certain types of loans and credit cards.  Experian charges Â£9.99 a month, and Equifax Â£9.99. Callcredit offers a free service called Noddle. However, with Experian's service, for example, anyone who signs up is pointed to a list of credit cards they could apply for.  WHO WATCHes THE CREDIT spIES?  Michael Cole, 65, a businessman from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, had never checked his credit report until last year. He was planning to buy a new buy-to-let property and became worried when the bank he had applied to for a mortgage started asking increasingly detailed personal questions.  So, he checked his credit file with Equifax and uncovered a list of errors.  It said he had lived at a previous address for three years, when it was in fact 25, and it incorrectly claimed he owed BT Â£89.  His current credit card wasn't listed but lists of credit and store cards that he had closed years ago were.  It took Mr Cole five months to resolve the errors. The dispute forced him to put the buy-to-let project on hold. He says: 'I have asked where Equifax got the information from. They never told me.  'The whole system appears to be out of control and unregulated. There are no penalties for damage caused by the errors of these companies, yet the impact they can have on people's lives is devastating.'  Correcting wrong information on your credit file can be hugely inconvenient, and leave you struggling financially. The system is weighted in favour of the banks. It is up to you to spot errors and fight them.  The agencies say they constantly check information. They argue they make very few errors compared with the amount of data they process  However, a survey by consumer group Which? found that as many as one in eight credit reports is incorrect.  Britain's biggest High Street names treat your credit report as gospel, and however much you protest they won't budge until it is corrected at source.  But you can't change your credit file yourself . The only alteration you can make is to put a note of no more than 200 words next to the black mark.  Only the bank, insurance company or mobile phone provider that filed the incorrect record can change it, so you must take up the dispute with them through the credit reference agencies.  Banks have 28 days to investigate. If they fail to resolve your problem, your record will remain incorrect â€” though it may be marked as disputed.  After this you can complain to the Financial Ombudsman Service.  The Information Commissioner's Office also checks whether the credit agencies and the banks are complying with the Data Protection Act.  the shop staff who can see your file  There are no official rules over who can see your data. The only proviso is that they are part of a firm that has subscribed to the credit reference agency database and that there is a legitimate reason why they would need to see it.  Any staff who can access your file must abide by the Data Protection Act. However, they do not have to undergo training or hold any qualifications before they can see your file â€” though many big banks and insurance companies do insist on this.  You must give permission for your report to be accessed â€” but it is possible you can do this unwittingly as it often forms part of an application for a loan, credit card or mobile phone.  In reality, most of the time an organisation does a credit check on you, the person viewing your file cannot see your specific personal details.  What they are looking at will be a rating given to you by that company's computer systems, which have analysed your details. This may be as simple as 'accept' or 'reject'.  This is the practice with most High Street names. However, the growth of credit files has raised concerns over how smaller firms can use your details, and whether anyone from a secretary to a director can see your record.  All the credit agencies stress that they make every effort to protect the personal information. A spokesman from Experian says: 'Our work is closely regulated and we  * Public information, such as your address, or electoral roll details  * Credit card and loan borrowing and repayments  * Some mobile phone bills  * Some water and energy bills  * Payday loans  * Court records  * Details of debts owed at previous addresses  * Fraud allegations  Â© Daily Mail",1
First-home buyers using government deposit scheme to pay thousands in extra interest,"First-home buyers using the Coalition's controversial deposit scheme will pay tens of thousands of dollars in extra interest and face larger monthly repayments in a major windfall for some of Australia's largest banks and lenders.

As Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded the policy would have a ""firming"" affect on falling house prices, experts warned a key element of the plan will actually leave first-time buyers in debt for much longer.
But former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser gave tentative backing to the policy, saying it should help people ""at the margin"" enter the property market and that caution among banks would prevent borrowers taking on excessive debt.  Under the Coalition's election-eve proposal - which was swiftly matched by Labor - first home buyers will only need a 5 per cent deposit for a mortgage compared to the usual 20 per cent. The government will effectively guarantee the difference for up to 10,000 people a year.  But borrowing the difference between a 5 and 20 per cent deposit will bite the new home owners for the length of a 30-year mortgage.  On a $500,000 property, a first-time buyer now has to stump up $100,000 deposit, leaving them with a $400,000 mortgage. Over the life of a 30 year loan, the buyer would pay $304,000 in interest with monthly repayments of $1956.  But a 5 per cent deposit on the same property would be $25,000, forcing the buyer to borrow $475,000. Over the life of that loan, they would pay $57,000 more in interest than someone with a 20 per cent deposit.  Of more immediate concern would be the monthly repayment of $2327, or $371 more than the person who had a larger deposit.  Someone taking out a mortgage on a $400,000 property would face $289,000 in interest under the Coalition's proposal compared to $247,000 if they had a 20 per cent deposit.  A person with 20 per cent downpayment would make a $1565 monthly repayment compared to $1858 for someone with the bare minimum deposit.  Mr Fraser, who also chaired ME Bank after running the RBA between 1989 and 1996, said the banks' current caution would protect borrowers.  ""For the time being I think they're going to be pretty cautious and pretty prudent, and it's that that I think will in a way protect prospective first-home buyers to some extent,"" he said.  IFM Investors chief economist Alex Joiner said the best policies to make housing more affordable were those that encouraged stable employment and solidy increased wages.  He said the Coalition's plan, which was matched by Labor leader Bill Shorten within two hours of being announced on Sunday, would actually load up debt on people who were not in a solid financial position to take it on.  ""The government talks about the price of a house, they don't talk about the cost that these people are going to saddled with for years and years,"" he said.  ""They're trying to shoe-horn people into the property market. These are people who are at the marginal end of the market and so can't afford to be it in the first place, and probably shouldn't be there.""  Mr Morrison on Tuesday said the scheme ""wasn't free money"" but said it would mean less young Australians need to ask the ""bank of mum and dad"" for the cash. He has already flagged that the policy could be expanded if there was strong demand.  Grattan Institute fellow Brendan Coates said in its current form, capped at 10,000 entrants a year, the policy would have almost no impact but warned any expansion could actually make the situation more difficult for first time buyers.  ""If you get rid of the cap then you'd have people pulling forward their purchases, you'd have more people in the market competing for the same properties, that would drive up prices and do nothing for affordability,"" he said.  ""If you really want to deal with this you have to deal with supply and that means looking at planning regulations in the middle-ring suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.""  Former prime minister Paul Keating also warned the policy focussed on demand rather than the supply of properties available to first time buyers.  ""The risk is that people get the 5 per cent, momentarily it helps them but the prices rise by more than 5 per cent on the supply side,"" he told ABC radio. ""The supply side doesn't increase the prices by 5 per cent.""  Mr Morrison confirmed a report by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age that the policy had not gone to cabinet, saying it had been discussed by the Coalition's ""senior economics team"".  Mr Shorten deflected questions over Labor's quick support for the policy, labelling it a ""modest proposal"" while arguing the opposition was doing far more to encourage housing affordability.

Why is an RRSP a good idea?,"rrsPs are relatively easy to set up. you can make arrangements through financial advisors, financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, or have investment brokers or financial planners help you find the right plan for you and assist you with the paperwork. you can let an advisor choose and manage your investments, or you can take a more active role by setting up a self-directed rrsP.

""an rrsP helps you save for retirement and gives you an immediate tax benefit when you make a contribution to it,"" says Bruce Barran, cPa, ca, a partner with davis martin-dale llP in london. ""That tax deduction helps you reduce your taxable income for the year in question. it's a key benefit for people who contribute to rrsPs. Plus, the income you earn in the rrsP is only taxed when you withdraw the funds at a later date. ideally, you make rrsP contributions when you are in a higher tax bracket and withdrawals when you are in a lower one.""
a few things to note when considering an rrsP, you must have a social insurance number and earned income to start an rrsP. Why is that? your previous year's employment income is used to determine contribution room for the current tax year. For 2014, each taxpayer's annual contribution room is calculated as 18 per cent of their 2013 earned income, to a max imum of $24,270, less any required pension adjustments. The contribution limit increases to $24,930 for the 2015 taxation year. also, any unused contribution room from previous years is carried for-ward, so the amount that you can contribute may be even higher.  ""your rrsP can include many kinds of investments, such as Gics, stocks, bonds and mutual funds,"" Barran explains. ""Government pensions are not enough to retire on. you need to plan ahead for retirement and rrsPs are a good retirement savings vehicle.""  To decide whether or not an rrsP is right for you, consider your age, your current income level, the time you're likely to need to withdraw the funds for retirement, and what your tax rate is expected to be when the funds will be withdrawn. you should also consider if other options, such as a Tax-Free savings account or and registered education savings Plan, make more sense for your savings at this stage of your life.  To make an rrsP contribution and include the deduction on your 2014 personal tax return, you must make your contribution by march 2, 2015.  - - -  RRsP checklist  A social insurance number and earned income is needed to start an RRSP.  Contribute to an RRSP by March 2, 2015.Why? To qualify as a 2014 deduction, contributions to your personal or spousal RRSPs must be made by this date.  How much should you contribute? To determine your RRSP contribution limit for 2014, refer to your previous year's Notice of Assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), or visit the CRA website at www.cra-arc.gc.ca.  Note: For 2014, each taxpayer's annual contribution room is calculated as 18 per cent of their 2013 earned income, to a maximum of $24,270, less any required pension adjustments.  Determine what amount, if any, you have already contributed to your RRSP for 2014.You may have made contributions throughout the year, or have unused contribution room from previous years that you can use, up to your 2014 RRSP contribution limit.  Remember to consider group RRSPs. You will receive a 2014 tax deduction for this amount as long as the contribution is made by the deadline.  Watch the mail for your receipts. If you're filing a paper income tax return, you must attach receipts for all amounts contributed from March 4, 2014 to March 2, 2015 inclusive. This includes any amounts you are not deducting on your income tax and benefit return for 2014, and those you are designating as Home Buyers'Plan or Lifelong Learning Plan repayments.",1
"Investor Optimism Highest in Seven Years, Says Survey","Investors are feeling more optimistic than they have in years but remain concerned about stagnant income, according to a survey conducted by Wells Fargo & Co. and Gallup.

The Wells Fargo/Gallup Investor and Retirement Optimism Index jumped to 46 in the third quarter, its highest level in seven years, with much of the gains stemming from investors' heightened optimism about economic growth and the labor market, according to the survey. However, six in 10 of those surveyed said they are doing no better financially than they were five years ago, signaling limited progress during the U.S. economy's gradual recovery.
The quarterly survey measures the perceptions of more than 1,000 U.S. investors with $10,000 or more in investible assets.  Investor optimism also still remains well below its pre-2008 recession average, with investors still skeptical about growing their savings in the stock markets and about their ability to increase their income.  The majority of nonretired investors expect their income to be stagnant, as 61% of nonretirees with $100,000 or more in assets said they don't foresee a time when their income will be significantly higher than it is today.  ""Investors are saying they're more optimistic about the economy and the job market. But nonretirees worry about their ability to earn more in their lifetime,"" said Karen Wimbish, director of retail retirement at Wells Fargo. ""Clearly, average investors have not forgotten their recession experiences.""  In addition, investors remain wary of the stock market, with 60% saying caution toward investing in the market is ""wise"" since it protects them from possible market losses. The majority, however, still actively choose stocks for their long-term investment accounts, with just 29% avoiding stocks in long-term accounts.

WOMEN 'ON A MISSION' TO AID SENIORS; NEW FIRM HELPS WITH RETIREMENT HEALTH INSURANCE,"With a combined 70-plus years helping Medicare recipients and supplemental insurance customers, three long-time friends and colleagues say they are now ""on a mission"" to help seniors and retirees.

New business partners Trish Vandre of Barboo, Deb Harvey of Portage and Mary Olson of Lodi said they have spent too many years seeing older people make the wrong decisions when choosing health insurance coverage.
Last month, they started Retirement Specialists LLC to help new retirees navigate the maze of information, jargon and potential confusion surrounding Medicare and help direct them toward the right health insurance taking into account an individual's financial situation and health conditions as they enter retirement.  All three are trained social workers. Until last month, Harvey and Vandre worked for Sauk County Aging and Disability Resource Center as legal advocates. Olson comes from Dean Healthcare specializing in Deancare Gold.  The three left their jobs last month to embark on a new business, where all agreed they could help people more thoroughly by going into private practice.  ""People nearing retirement get inundated with information about Medicare and insurance policies and Part D plans, and no matter what their business was, they are not experts in this,"" Vandre said. ""We've all spent 20-plus years working with older people in the areas of Medicare and all things health insurance.""  Harvey said that in her years of working for the county, she wasn't able to refer older people to what she believed would be the best health insurance plans available. ADRC workers are able to help seniors navigate Medicare, but cannot recommend one private insurance plan over another.  ""I'd have to say to them, 'You really have to go look in the phone book or find an agent,'"" Harvey said. ""The hard part for me was once people get past that six months of getting Medicare, they're under this false impression they can come and go out of health insurance, and you can't.""  That's because a new health insurance provider requires a health questionnaire, the results of which can be used to deny coverage.  After partnering with her colleagues, Harvey said she has the freedom to advise clients to choose an insurance plan like Physicians Mutual.  ""It's A-plus rated,"" Harvey said. ""I can't say enough about it. It's the on-going service, and we're right here. We don't take the money and run.""  Selling insurance plans may be the bread and butter of their business, but the three say they perform a lot of pro bono work because Medicare is so confusing to new retirees.  Olson's experise for the last 17 years was with Deancare Gold. However, starting in January 2016, that plan no longer will be sold. She said a new Medicare Advantage Plan will be released this fall.  Rather than work with an entirely new Medicare program through Dean, Olson decided to join Vandre and Harvey in the new endeavor.  Vandre said they strive to take the time and explain to people what it means to sign up for Medicare for the first time, and to talk about why they are such believers in Physicians Mutual for health care benefits in retirement.  ""They have quality products and amazing service,"" Vandre said. ""They're a mutual, so every policy holder is a member, like a co-op. The company puts preventative care first, and they invest in preventative care.""  Harvey said it's also affordable.  ""In the 21 years I've done this job, I have never seen an insurance company go down in rates and Physicians Mutual went down seven percent this year,"" Harvey said.

PENSION REFORM 'RISKS CREATING A LOST GENERATION',"THE Government has been accused of dragging its heels over plans to encourage more people to save for retirement through a works pension.

Steve Webb, the former Pensions Minister who oversaw the introduction of auto-enrolment in late 2012, says the recommendations announced today to extend the regime to more workers are 'shockingly lethargic'.
'This pedestrian pace of reform risks creating a lost generation of people in their late 40s who will simply be unable to afford to retire,' he adds.  Webb's ire is centred on the fact that the plans outlined by David Gauke, Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, will not be implemented until the 'mid-2020s', meaning millions of workers will still not be automatically enrolled into their employer's pension fund. These 'excluded' workers will include the low-paid, those with a number of poor paying jobs, and those under the age of 22.  A Conservative manifesto commitment to bring the self-employed into the auto-enrolment net has also been ignored, although the Government says it will look at ways in which 'technology' can be used to encourage the country's 4.8?million army of self-employed to increase their pension saving.  Some nine million workers are now saving into a pension for the first time as a result of auto-enrolment - with their payments topped up with tax relief and an employer contribution. Although they have the right to opt out, few do. The key proposals included in the auto-enrolment review will result in both more workers being drawn into pensions and employees saving more than currently.  The age below which workers are excluded from auto-enrolment will drop from 22 to 18, a move benefiting women in particular because it will give them more time to save - making good the periods they take time out of the workplace to have children or look after elderly parents.  Also, the slice of annual earnings (currently between Â£5,876 and Â£45,000) used to determine the amount of contribution that ends up in someone's works pension fund will widen with the dropping of the lower earnings limit.  The Government says these respective measures will help introduce 900,000 young people into pensions and bring an extra Â£2.6?billion into pension saving. Gauke says: 'We are committed to enabling more people to save while they are working so that they can enjoy greater financial security when they retire.'  The Government's decision to delay the reforms until the mid-2020s has probably been prompted by concerns over a possible backlash from businesses which will have to pay more in pension contributions as a result. Many companies are fearful of an economic hiccup resulting from Brexit.  Neil Carberry, managing director of lobby group the Confederation of British Business, says a timeline of the mid-2020s for the new proposals is 'sensible' and would 'enjoy business support'.

Risky Student Debt Is Starting to Sour,"The number of student loans held by subprime borrowers is growing, and more of those loans are souring, the latest signs that a weak job market and rising debt loads are squeezing recent graduates.

In all, 33% of all subprime student loans in repayment were 90 days or more past due in March 2012, up from 24% in 2007, according to a Wednesday report by TransUnion LLC.
Meanwhile, the Chicago-based credit bureau found that 33% of the almost $900 billion in outstanding student loans was held by subprime, or the riskiest, borrowers as of March 2012, up from 31% in 2007.  ""If you become subprime, it's more likely that you will not pay your debt,"" said TransUnion Vice President Ezra Becker, who oversaw the study.  The high debt loads could weigh on consumer spending and the economy, said Cristian de Ritis, a senior director with Moody's Analytics, a unit of Moody's Corp. If the defaults continue to increase, ""the taxpayer is going to be on the hook for losses,"" he added.  The federal government has taken a more active role in student lending and now makes about 93% of all loans.  Another study, released by Fitch Ratings, a unit of Fimalac SA and Hearst Corp., Wednesday, warned that the gap between college costs and what students can borrow under the federal student-loan program will continue to widen.  TransUnion performed its study at the request of credit unions, which make private student loans.  In the five years through last March, the portion of all student loans that were 90 days or more delinquent rose to 11.4% from 8.8%, while the average student- loan balance per borrower increased 30% to $23,829, TransUnion found.  For some borrowers, the burden is even greater. Kristin Jones, 24 years old, ran out of money to complete her education at Northeastern University in Boston and, with more than $60,000 in student-loan debt, is looking to finish her senior year at a cheaper school.  Ms. Jones, who works for a company that manages corporate-benefits plans, said she fell behind on her student loans after she found she couldn't afford to go back to Northeastern and her loan payments started kicking in.  ""I'll be pretty much trapped for life by these loans and the credit default,"" said Ms. Jones, who is on a repayment plan but still owes Northeastern one semester's tuition.  The TransUnion study didn't measure whether borrowers had poor credit scores at the time they took out their loans or if their credit scores dropped because of their repayment problems. Missed student-loan payments are more likely to have a big impact on the scores of borrowers with short credit histories such as recent college graduates, TransUnion said.  Another study, released Tuesday by credit-score provider Fair Isaac Corp., found that roughly 26 million consumers had two or more open student loans on their credit report in October 2012, up from about 12 million in 2005. A majority of bank risk managers expect student-loan delinquencies to continue to rise, according to Fair Isaac.  To be sure, the rise in student-loan debt is being at least partially offset by reductions in other types of debt, such as credit cards and mortgages, said Richard Fry, a senior economist with the Pew Research Center in Washington. That should make repaying student-loan debt more manageable for some families, he said.  But Dahjanay Williams, a 21-year-old junior at Wheaton College in Massachusetts, still worries that if she doesn't get a job before her loans come due, she won't be able to make regular payments and her credit will take a hit. ""That might mess up my credit history,"" said the New York City native.  Repaying debt has become more difficult in part because loan balances have grown and the interest rates on federal loans have increased as a result of a shift from variable-rate to fixed-rate loans. Most federal loans now carry interest rates of 6.8% or 7.9%, versus a rate of 2.875% on federal Stafford loans in May 2005, said Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of the financial-aid website FinAid.org.  Jennifer France became delinquent on her loan payments once, in 2009. Now, there is a good chance she will become delinquent again, she said.  The 36-year-old public defender from Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., borrowed about $100,000 in federal loans and $30,000 in private loans to cover law school more than a decade ago. She has taken advantage of the income-based repayment option, which allows borrowers to peg their federal loan payments to a certain portion of income and lowers a borrower's monthly payment. But her income recently went up, and her monthly payment on all loans jumped from around $500 to more than $800, which might be too much for her to keep up with.  ""Maybe they shouldn't be so willing to give money to kids,"" she said, ""We all thought we'd be making $100,000 out the door.""  Stafford loans, which account for more than three-fourths of federal student loans, impose no credit standards and are capped at a total of $57,500 for undergraduates. Ruben Medrano, a 52-year-old undergraduate studying business management at Texas A&M University-San Antonio, said taking out about $26,000 in federal student loans was much easier than taking out an auto loan or a mortgage. ""The last vehicle we purchased, we spent four to five hours in the dealership,"" Mr. Medrano said. ""The student-loan process took me 30 to 45 minutes and I never had to leave my home.""

Catch up contributions are also jumping $500, to $6,500 in 2020. That means Americans 50 years and older can contribute a total of $26,000 in 2020.  The maximum contribution for individual retirement accounts will remain at $6,000, as will the catch-up contribution for those accounts (at $1,000). SIMPLE plans are going up to $13,500 next year, from $13,000 in 2019.  The IRS has also adjusted the income limits for eligible deductions of IRA contributions. The phase-out range determines if a taxpayer can claim a deduction on their federal income tax return for their IRA contributions â€” someone who earns between the range would be limited in what they can claim, whereas someone earning past the range would not be able to claim a deduction. Taxpayers who are not covered by an employer-sponsored plan can deduct their contributions in full, according to the IRS.  The new limits, beginning Jan. 1, 2020, are as follows:  The phaseout range for single account holders of traditional IRAs and heads of household who are active participants of a plan is $65,000 to $75,000;  For married couples filing jointly, where the spouse who makes the IRA contribution is an active participant in a qualified account, the phase-out range is between $104,000 and $124,000;  For an IRA contributor who is not an active participant but is married to someone who is, the range is $196,000 and $206,000;  And for married individuals filing separately, the phase-out range for an active participant remains at $0 to $10,000.  See:Itâ€™s going to be easier to make early 401(k) withdrawals, but should you do it?  Roth IRAs, which are funded with after-tax dollars, have separate income limits and no deductions, and are held to these phase-out ranges for making contributions:  In 2020, singles and heads of households have an adjusted gross income range between $124,000 and $139,000;  Married taxpayers filing jointly have a phase-out range between $196,000 and $206,000;  And for married individuals filing separately, the phase-out remains at $0 to $10,000.  The total contribution limit to 401(k) and similar plans increased to $57,000, up from $56,000, and would include employee contributions as well as employer contributions.  Many Americans donâ€™t max out their 401(k) plans. Only 13% of participants did so in 2017, when the limit was $18,000, according to a 2018 Vanguard report about its investors, and they were typically participants who had higher incomes, were older and had a longer tenure at their employers. Comparatively, 9.1% of Fidelity investors with a 401(k) plan had maxed out their accounts in 2018, up from 9% in 2017 and 8.1% at the end of 2013.

"WSJ: US States, Facing Budget Deficits, Look To Hybrid Pensions","State governments, the last bastion of guaranteed pensions, are increasingly looking to the 401(k)-style plans that dominate the private sector.

Some new state workers in Michigan and Utah will soon begin to receive part of their retirement benefits from a 401(k)-type plan, after lawmakers there recently voted to adopt plans that combine a 401(k) component with a guaranteed benefit.
These hybrid plans are a cost-cutting measure for states seeking to pare back the guaranteed retirement payments considered a bedrock benefit for government workers. In down markets, the plans could mean less-generous benefits for these workers, who have sidestepped the market volatility many of their private-sector counterparts endured in recent years.  Utah and Michigan join six other states that have some form of hybrid plans for public workers. Most of those states, including Oregon and Washington, set up hybrid plans within the past 15 years.  (This story and related background material will be available on The Wall Street Journal Web site, WSJ.com.)  A number of other states, facing looming pension-fund liabilities, have expressed interest in hybrid plans, industry participants say. Some officials in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, for instance, are contemplating a move to a hybrid plan.  ""Reality is not negotiable,"" said Utah state Sen. Dan Liljenquist, a Republican who was instrumental in crafting the legislation for the pension changes in that state. ""The fact is somebody bears the risk. Ultimately, the state is bearing more risk than it can.""  Total unfunded public-pension liabilities in the U.S. increased to $457.8 billion in fiscal year 2008 from $368.5 billion in 2007, according to a June report by Standard & Poor's, citing the most complete data available. States have taken various measures to bridge that funding gap, including scaling back cost-of-living adjustments, increasing monthly contributions from employees toward their pensions or extending the retirement age. Often the changes affect only new hires.  In the search for other ways to tackle the problem, these hybrid plans can represent a middle ground. Since they maintain a defined-benefit plan for workers, the hybrid plans can help lawmakers skirt the political backlash that could accompany any threat to a defined-benefit plan, while they move some of the investment risk to employees.  Though it isn't a booming trend, ""hybrids are being looked at now more than ever before,"" said Cathie Eitelberg, senior vice president and public-sector practice leader at Segal Co., whose clients include government pension funds.  ""The opponents of defined-benefit plans have been out there for a long time"" and, given recent market losses, ""the agenda is just ripe for downsizing,"" she added.  In Utah, where state employers were facing rising contribution rates, new workers as of July 1, 2011, can choose to enroll in a defined-contribution plan--such as a 401(k)--or a hybrid plan. In the hybrid plan, workers can invest in a 401(k)-type fund. State and employee contributions to the defined-benefit portion of the hybrid plan fluctuate based on the financing of the pension fund. The state contribution is capped at 10% in both plans.  In Michigan, new school employees as of July 1 will contribute 2% of monthly income to a 401(k)-type fund, with state employers matching up to 1% of pay. Employees are automatically enrolled in the fund, but can choose to opt out or choose to contribute more.  There is still a defined benefit component, but it will cost the state less: Public employers will contribute on average 2.5% of an employee's monthly income toward retirement, down from an average base of 4%. There is no longer a cost-of-living adjustment.  Retirement officials think that change may encourage new workers to remain in the 401(k)-type fund in order to try to make up for the lost annual bump.  ""We hope to create a culture of savings"" with the defined-contribution component, said Phil Stoddard, director of Michigan's Office of Retirement Services. The 401(k) component makes the benefit plan attractive for younger workers who are unlikely to remain in one job for 30 years, Stoddard said.  Some workers aren't enthralled. ""It's less benefit overall because of the variability of that 401(k) component,"" said Doug Pratt, director of communications for the Michigan Education Association, a union representing 130,000 school employees.  The reduced benefits mean ""we're going to lose some good people"" who will find the benefits package less attractive, Pratt said. But a hybrid plan is ""certainly a better alternative than ditching pensions all together.""  The vast majority of public-sector employees have a defined-benefit plan--79% in 2008, according to the most recent data available from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit research institute in Washington. In comparison, 33% of private-sector employees were enrolled in a defined-benefit plan in the same period.  In 2008, 18% of state workers had a defined-contribution plan, compared with 55% of private-sector workers enrolled in a defined-contribution plan.  The heightened interest in hybrid plans doesn't appear to foreshadow a swift change toward defined-contribution plans. Though defined-contribution plans are often on legislative agendas, they rarely have been adopted in the public sector, said Ron Snell, director of the state-services division for the National Conference of State Legislatures.  Only Alaska and the District of Columbia have mandatory defined-contribution plans for all workers, according to a June report by Snell.  -By Jeannette Neumann, The Wall Street Journal; jeannette.neumann@wsj.com  (END) Dow Jones Newswires  July 09, 2010 17:58 ET (21:58 GMT)",1
How to foot the bill for a college education,"When it comes to paying for your children's college, the best advice is to start saving early and often.

""The earlier you start, the easier it is to achieve your goal,"" said Jud Powell, a financial advisor with Edward Jones in Abilene. ""That's exactly right. If you have a goal in mind, there are so many tools available to you.""
Powell said there are websites available that can estimate how much money you'll need by plugging in the name of the school and the year the child will be attending. A word of caution, however, about how high that figure could be.  ""I was talking to some grandparents about it and they said their grandkids wanted to go to Clemson because they live in South Carolina,"" said Powell. ""We looked at the cost and they said, 'There's no way.' I said, 'Yes, there is, because we've always had inflation.""  If people start early, Powell said one of the best tools is a college 529 plan, which allows you to put the money in the child's name and withdraw it tax free when the time comes.  If, for whatever reason, the child doesn't need the money for college, the plan can be put in another child's name with no penalty. Also, if the child is in college, the money doesn't have to go toward tuition. It can also be used for any other expenses associated with college.  For people who haven't started saving early for their children's college education and find it looming in front of them, Powell said it would be a mistake to borrow from a retirement account to pay for college, regardless of how attractive that may look at the time.  ""That's a bad idea for two reasons,"" he said. ""You have to pay taxes on it. And, if you're under 59 and a half, you have to pay an extra 10 percent penalty. You end up only getting about 75 cents for every dollar.""  There's another reason why Powell advises against that. You can borrow money for college. You can't borrow money for retirement.  Taking out of the retirement fund to pay for college could change your retirement plans by forcing you to work longer or by changing your standard of living in your retirement.  With the cost of a college education, one would think that most people would try to plan for it.  ""You'd be surprised at the number of people who don't,"" said Powell. ""A young person doesn't think 18 years is ever going to get here and they think they have plenty of time. It's like buying insurance for assisted living. We know we need to do it, but we put it off.""  For people who find themselves unprepared for the cost of college, there are some other options, said Lori Herrick, Director of Financial Aid at McMurry University.  ""How a student does in high school is important, not just their GPA, but extra curriculars and community service. They need to begin looking at scholarships that are available to them aggressively during their senior year.""  There are other ways that students can defray the cost of their college education. One is by taking dual credit courses while in high school. However, Herrick offered a caveat to that plan.  ""One thing to understand is that the child is going to be in an upper-level class and is still just 18 years old,"" she said. ""If they can handle that, dual credit is a great idea.""  Another option is for a student to attend a junior college for the first year to get those courses out of the way without incurring a huge debt.  A student also needs to be prepared to get through college in four years by taking advantage of block tuition, which most colleges charge.  Under block tuition, said Herrick, 12 hours cost as much as 18 hours.  ""We want students to be successful,"" said Herrick.",1
Long quest for small sum,"THE CRUSADER

READER Mr T Affleck, of Poole, Dorset, was concerned for some years about a sum of just under Â£200 in his pension fund. He first wrote to Scottish Widows about it in May 1998. ""I regret that our contract is with the trustees and I cannot enter into correspondence with individual members, "" an assistant wrote back.
Mr Affleck contacted the trustees and wrote to them again when he retired in December 2002 but received no reply on either occasion. In February this year he wrote again to Scottish Widows. No reply again. ""It is only a small pension, "" he told The Crusader, ""but it would be nice to know when, or if, I am going to receive it.""  We tried to contact the trustees but had as little success as Mr Affleck, so we got in touch with Scottish Widows.  Its customer relations manager replied promptly with a copy of a letter he was sending to Mr Affleck. ""The last contact we had with them [the trustees] was in 2002, "" he admitted, ""since when all correspondence has been returned marked 'gone away'. We do not therefore know their whereabouts or what the position is regarding their circumstances.  ""However, a decision has been taken that, in the apparent absence of the trustees, we will deal directly with the individual members of the scheme.""  This week, we heard from Mr Affleck again. ""Scottish Widows has offered me Â£231.81. You have achieved in a few weeks what I have tried to do for 18 months. I didn't think you would be bothered with such a small problem but you have proved that you mean what you say in the Daily Express."" ",1
An investment plan is a lifeline when you get that sinking feeling,"It's funny how when the market plunges, you can feel it physically. It's that sinking feeling. It's how I felt for a brief moment on Tuesday evening, after bad economic news continued to pour in and the S&P/TSX composite had just closed 383.73 points lower at 13,357.56.

My recovery was a lot quicker than the TSX's, though. Long before Wednesday's open, I had convinced myself that there was no need to be alarmed. I took some time out to think about my investments and decided not to change a thing. I realized right then and there that I had successfully adopted one of the most resolute tenets of personal finance advisers everywhere: Have a plan and stick to it. Take it from me, it really does make you feel secure amid the volatility.
According to Christine Benz, personal finance director at Morningstar Inc., a Chicago-based investment research firm, having an investment plan is the best way to protect yourself from â€œmaking sure you're not just responding to what's happening in the market today or this week.â€ She says it's astonishing to see the huge number of investors who, nervous by volatility in the markets, â€œsuddenly just uproot parts of their portfolio in an effort to keep their money safe.â€  These investors, she says, choose to find safety in money market accounts or even by holding cash, but that security comes at a cost: Returns can be so low that it's even hard to out-earn inflation.  That's particularly concerning because inflation is rising â€“ Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney said this week that the central bank expects inflation to rise above 4 per cent early next year. It means that you need to make even greater returns to cover inflation. Say you're investing in a mutual fund with fees of 2 per cent â€“ you'll need a return of 6 per cent before you start to make any profit.  The other place where panicked investors generally move their money, Ms. Benz says, is â€œto whatever has been working recently.â€ Right now in Canada, that would be energy or commodity stocks. The problem is that by the time investors decide to pull out of other investments and buy these â€œhotâ€ stocks, share prices are near their highs and there's little profit left to be made.  Ms. Benz says age is the most crucial consideration in drawing up an asset allocation plan and deciding how you're going to invest. How close are you to retirement and needing that money? If you have a long time frame, say 10 years or more, invest more heavily in stocks â€œbecause that's probably your best shot at out-earning inflation,â€ she says. It also means that you can ride out any volatility.  Ms. Benz also points out that investors are most secure when their portfolios are diversified. If you're investing in stocks, include some that pay dividends. They may seem old-fashioned, she says, but investing in some dividend-paying stocks in a company with a history of raising them â€œcan be a very attractive place to be.â€  But diversification goes beyond just the kind of stocks you hold. To achieve real diversification, Ms. Benz suggests that investors look beyond their borders and their home-country biases and think globally. If markets are volatile in North America, have some of your money invested in areas of the world that are faring better. Or think about investing in an emerging market where the growth rate is forecast to be much higher than Canada's 1 per cent for 2008.  To feel perfectly safe in volatile times, Ms. Benz also believes in having an emergency fund. Financial planners always advise clients to keep a bank account with three to six months of living expenses at the ready in case something goes wrong, like you lose your job or get sick, but how many of us really do it? I don't know anyone who does, even among my most financially attuned friends.  But Ms. Benz says such a fund not only gives you the security of having a safety net, but allows you to avoid tapping into your retirement funds or borrowing on high-cost credit to make ends meet should something go wrong.  These are all great tips, but I also take comfort in knowing that although the markets are volatile, we've been here before. In fact, in my second Investor's Diary on Jan. 26, I wrote of the unsettling plunge in the markets that saw the TSX lose 6.6 per cent of its value in five days a week before, and then fall another 605 points the following Monday.  My conclusion then: I was too nervous to make any move. Well, that was then, this is now. I think I may start looking for some bargains.",1
"For most people, employer-sponsored benefits are a sizable chunk of their total...","For most people, employer-sponsored benefits are a sizable chunk of their total compensation. That's why making the right choices is critical and it's worth spending the time to create a plan and get it right. From now through early December, most employees will have the opportunity to review and make changes to their benefit options.

Many of us simply check the boxes to continue our current benefits. Maintaining the status quo takes less time and is an easy way to validate the choices we've made in the past. Of course, if you have experienced a major life event, such as a significant job change, health issue, marriage, divorce, the birth of a child or a child leaving the nest, it's likely you're going to need to make some adjustments. However, even if you haven't had major change in your life, it's wise to take a hard look at all your benefits. Here are some key areas you should consider during your open enrollment period to ensure you're maximizing your benefits:
Retirement savings plan  Open enrollment is a prime time to consider boosting your retirement plan contributions and assess your investment choices. In 2016, individuals under 50 years old can contribute $18,000 to their 401(k) or 403(b) plan in 2016, while those ages 50 and older can contribute $24,000. You may also want to consider a Roth 401(k) or 403(b) as a way to build up retirement savings that may qualify to be withdrawn on a tax-free basis when you retire. It's important to note that the 2017 limits for both health care flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and retirement savings plans are indexed to inflation and have not been set yet (as of Sept. 14).  Health benefits  Insurance coverage is a top priority for most of us. Think about your own health and what your anticipated medical needs might be in the coming year and pick an appropriate plan. You might want to choose a plan with lower deductibles if you expect to address specific medical issues. A high deductible option may be best if you don't anticipate any major medical issues (although we never know when such problems may occur). If you go the high deductible route, consider a Health Savings Account (HSA). It allows you to set money aside on a pre-tax basis that can be used to meet current eligible out-of-pocket medical expenses, but can also be invested to grow and help pay future medical costs.  Flexible spending accounts (FSAs)  Your employer may offer the ability to use pre-tax dollars to fund spending accounts to help pay for medical and child care expenses. In effect, this reduces your out-of-pocket expenses in each area. There are limits to the amount you can put toward a health care and dependent care FSA each year; the dependent care limit depends on your marital status and age of your children. Check the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website so you know what your limit is.  Life insurance  If you have family members who rely on you for financial support, life insurance should be a priority. Life insurance helps protect the lifestyle and future goals of your loved ones in the event something happens to you. There are many factors that determine the amount of coverage you need. To start, look at your annual income, outstanding mortgage, future amount you intend to put toward retirement, estate taxes, uninsured medical expenses and funeral costs.  Disability and long-term care insurance  Many employers also offer disability income coverage. This is a valuable benefit to provide an income stream if an accident, injury or illness prevents you from working for an extended period.  Any option to purchase additional coverage is worth considering to have more complete protection. Some employers also offer the opportunity to purchase long-term care coverage with a group discount. Compare the costs with coverage you can purchase on your own to determine where you will get the best value.  Open enrollment season is a good time to talk to your employer's benefits administrator if you have questions about your options. It also makes sense to consult with your financial adviser for perspective on how your benefits fit with your overall financial plan.  â€”Timothy LePain of Natick is a financial adviser with Ameriprise Financial Services Inc., member FINRA and SIPC, in Natick.

The Talk You Must Have With Your Parents
","
Your parents are getting on in years. To some people, that means
they may soon come into their inheritance. But most people are more
concerned that what they will get are their parents' problems and
bills, or even the parents themselves.



Advisers say it is never too soon for adult children to start
talking with their parents about the ""what ifs,"" planning for what
could happen. But with the children trying to avoid looking greedy
and parents not wanting to give up control, broaching the subject
can be an emotional minefield.

 ""It is a loaded psychological issue,"" says Sharon Rich, a Belmont, Mass., financial planner. ""You are dealing with two of our culture's three big taboos -- death and money.""    Nonetheless, children who don't take that step may get a rude awakening. They may find themselves scavenging for wills, insurance policies and bank statements after their parents die. Or worse, they may find that they lack the basic tools to protect their parents' interests if they become seriously ill or incompetent.    A good first step is to put yourself in your parents' shoes, says Karen Spero, a Cleveland-based financial planner. That means recognizing that what is best for the parent isn't always best for the child. ""You must try to understand what the parent fears and what it really costs the parent to live,"" she says.    One real fear is often that the children want the money for themselves. ""Everyone is afraid of outliving their money,"" says Ms. Spero. ""In their concern about not having enough, they become somewhat suspicious about other people.""    Take that into consideration and it may be easier to move on to the four things financial and legal advisers generally agree children and their aging parents should address: a will, a durable power of attorney, a health-care proxy and a list of assets.    Alexander Bove Jr., a Boston estate attorney, says preparing a durable power of attorney is the most important step. The document, which should be drafted with the help of a good lawyer, would allow a child to do such things as sign tax returns, transfer assets into a trust and make financial decisions for a parent if he or she should become incompetent. If worded properly, it could even allow a child to establish trusts and make gifts for a parent, Mr. Bove says.    ""I would actually do the power of attorney before the will,"" he says, noting that a will is of no help whatsoever in dealing with the problems that can arise if parents become unable to conduct their own affairs, possibly years before they die.    Many parents don't want to give such power too soon for fear the kids will abuse it, spending the money or making foolish decisions. One solution, says Mr. Bove, is to execute the durable power of attorney, but leave it with a lawyer to be delivered to the child when necessary.    But a durable power of attorney doesn't replace a will. For one thing, its power lapses upon death. And in the absence of a will, or the appropriate trusts, the state will impose its own formula on distribution of the estate.    In a second marriage, for instance, that means that the new spouse could get some of the share intended for the children. ""In a case like that, for sure, we don't want to downplay the importance of a will,"" says Mr. Bove.    The third critical item is a health-care proxy. With this document, the parent would delegate the right to make health-care decisions, such as whether to undergo an operation. Rules vary from state to state, but often a living will is incorporated into the document, outlining specifically what measures would be acceptable to prolong life.    While on the topic of health care, children may also want to tackle funeral arrangements. ""This may be harder for the kids to deal with than the parents,"" says Ms. Spero. But it is important to find out if the parents have already bought burial plots or made arrangements with a specific funeral home.    The fourth area is the list of assets and where they can be found. That means listing not only bank accounts and stock certificates, but also pension plans, insurance policies and individual retirement accounts. Don't forget things like money due, such as a loan made to a sister but never openly discussed. Even the mortgage coupon book should be on the list.    Parents may not like telling all to their children. But consider the alternative of trying to reconstruct an estate with no guidelines. ""It can really be a nightmare and often is,"" says Max Gutierrez, a partner at the law firm of Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison in San Francisco.    He tells of children finding stock certificates in the attic years after their parents' deaths. In one case, missing jewelry ""had people eyeing one another suspiciously"" until it was eventually found behind a loose board in a closet. And in at least one case, the children were trying to reconstruct the assets from the parents' tax returns -- ""only to find that they hadn't filed taxes for years,"" he says.    When making the list, it's a good idea to record the date of purchase and the purchase price. This provides a basis price for tax purposes in case assets have to be sold as the parents get older. Also remember that some assets, like brokerage accounts, may require special powers of attorney, since some financial institutions don't honor a durable power of attorney.    Having tackled the basics, children may find it easier to begin discussing financial planning with their parents. Sometimes, the most important financial assistance given an aging parent may be as simple as helping to open the mail and pay the bills. Or it may require some reallocation of assets.    But children must be careful not to trample their parents' security in a search for higher yield, warns Ms. Spero. Money socked away in 3% certificates of deposit, for example, may seem a less-than-optimum investment today, but that doesn't mean the child should push to put that money into a riskier, higher-yielding investment.    ""You can't disrupt someone that much,"" she says, noting that the CDs may make the parent feel secure.    Indeed, advisers say that it often helps to bring in a third party if big changes are needed. That tends to make it easier for the parent to accept the advice, since it can no longer be either judgmental or self-serving on the part of the child. ",1
Rocket Dollar Study Shows The Majority of Americans Want to Diversify Their Retirement Accounts,"
   -- 63% of Americans are not sure they can depend on Social Security, 
      motivating them to have retirement accounts. 
 
   -- 74% of Americans want the option to diversify their retirement accounts 
      to the investments of their choosing. 
 
   -- 69% of younger millennials are interested in investing in alternative 
      assets using a retirement account. 

AUSTIN, Texas, April 26, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- In partnership with The Center for Generational Kinetics (CGK), the award-winning alternative investment platform Rocket Dollar has organized a national study aimed at outlining the public's understanding and interest in retirement savings, alternative assets, and ways to invest along with motivational drivers for investing.
As Social Security Declines, Americans Seek New Solutions  As it currently stands, Social Security is set to run out of funds for full payments by 2034, a year earlier than previously anticipated. With retirement looming closer for some demographics, it's unsurprising that Americans are exploring options to secure their financial futures outside of government-funded ventures.  Rocket Dollar's study highlights the subsequent rise in interest surrounding alternative investments in response to this growing need for diversification. One particularly interesting data point revealed through the study shows that 63% of Americans said their lack of trust in Social Security stands as the leading motivator for having retirement accounts.  The gender breakdown suggests motivators are rooted deeply in individual concerns for financial stability and protection. While men are significantly more motivated than women to have a retirement account in order to reduce their taxable income and have tax-free growth in the future, women are reported to be significantly more motivated due to the uncertainty surrounding the receipt of Social Security benefits and the ability to create a legacy for their futures and the futures of their families.  A Growing Interest in Alternative Investments  Knowing the importance of diversification for long-term investing, especially when it comes to retirement, 74% of Americans want the option to diversify their retirement account to the investments of their choosing, including alternative investments. Across millennials, Gen X and boomers, 53% of all respondents are interested in learning how they can use a retirement account to invest in alternative investments, with younger millennials being the most enthusiastic about the topic.  General awareness of specific types of alternatives varied by generation. Baby boomers were noticeably more aware of investment options such as real estate (67%), precious metals (64%), collectibles (58%), and commodities (48%), compared to younger millennials with regard to real estate (41%), precious metals (31%), collectibles (29%), and commodities (24%). Cryptocurrency had the smallest awareness gap across generations, with 46% of younger millennials reporting familiarity compared to 51% of older millennials, and 55% of baby boomers.  Welcoming a New Era of Investors  Overall, the generational interest in investing in alternative assets using retirement accounts suggests a new age of investors is emerging, with 69% of younger millennials reporting marked interest, followed by 63% of older millennials and 55% of Gen X participants. While 45% of the participants currently invest in at least one type of alternative investment, regardless of age, men reported a substantially higher interest in alternative investments with over 51% of male participants investing currently, compared to 39% of women. The study also revealed the fact that cryptocurrency has become the most popular alternative asset across the board, with 15% of Americans now currently investing in crypto, surpassing collectibles (10%), precious metals (9%), and real estate (8%).  ""As the insecurity of social security becomes more apparent, we are seeing more Americans seeking financial security elsewhere. Every generation of adult Americans believe having a retirement account and being able to contribute to it is important for one's legacy,"" said Henry Yoshida, CEO of Rocket Dollar. ""This study makes it clear that the public is now looking to utilize their retirement accounts to invest in alternative assets as a way to diversify their retirement savings. There is a marked need to offer a variety of alternative investments alongside educational assistance to further the public's understanding of alternative investments available to them.""  This study, ""Unlocking the Power of Alternative Investments in Self-Directed IRAs"" analyzes extensive data to understand how best to bridge the knowledge gap between the ultra-wealthy and the average investor. The study included 1,500 U.S. participants (ages 25-80), weighted to the 2020 U.S. Census for age, region, gender, and ethnicity.

Farming Money - A rich harvest for from investments.  ,"COUNTY Londonderry farmer David Lynch knows one of the first rules is ""as you sow, so shall you reap,"" and he started sowing the seeds for his future security 30 years ago, when, as a 19-year-old, he committed Â£125 a year to an endowment policy with NFU Mutual.  

At the time it was roughly two weeks wages.  
Last month, his policy matured, and he picked up a cheque for 729 per cent more than the original guaranteed sum assured.    Mr Lynch does not want to reveal exactly the size of that payout, but says it was a sum that far exceeded his expectations; the probability is it will not have been far short of Â£30,000.    He said: ""I was fortunate, as a young man, to have a local NFU Mutual agent who gave me such good advice, but I am concerned that the trend today is to spend rather than save.    ""Every week I receive offers inviting me to take out a new credit card and it worries me that people are being encouraged to borrow beyond their means, instead of saving for the future.""    His advice to others is: ""Start young and invest a little every month, it is the best way to ride the highs and lows in the stock market.    ""It is surprising how quickly you stop noticing the small monthly payments, but even more surprising how much compound interest makes your investment grow over the years.""    It's not the end of good news for Mr Lynch, in a few years his NFU Mutual and lump sum pension policies mature.   ",1
â€˜I would like to start savings pots for my childrenâ€™,"Our experts advise a reader on achieving the best long-term returns

Kate Kells, 45, wants to invest in her childrenâ€™s future. The mother of three, from Ilkeston in Derbyshire, has decided to make Â£50 available each month for her sons â€” James, 17, Mark and Ben, both 14 â€” and wants to know where best to invest it.
Ms Kells, a former district nurse who works occasionally as a school invigilator, and her partner, Colin, a tanker driver, want this to be a long-term nest egg to help their children to afford a property or important expenses when theyâ€™re older. To that end, she wants it to be stored in accounts that her children canâ€™t touch until theyâ€™re at least 21.  â€œI donâ€™t want this to be spent as pocket money,â€ she says. â€œMy oldest son is looking at universities, and the last thing I want is for it to be swallowed up while heâ€™s there. This is for afterwards, for buying a property and for expenses later in life. I am so aware of how expensive everything is, and we want to be able to help them as much as we can.â€  Ms Kells already contributes to the money she is putting away for her children by reining in her spending habits.  THE EXPERTS  Rob Burgeman from Brewin Dolphin, a wealth manager  â€œBy using regular savings, your children will benefit from what is known as pound cost averaging. Basically, when stock markets perform less well, you buy more shares and, when they perform strongly, you buy less. This lowers the risk associated with investing a lump sum because you will pay the average price over a period.  â€œGiven the time frame, I think that you can look at an equity-focused fund. Shares can go up and down sharply at times, but the regular nature of the savings and the length of time should mitigate this risk. A number of investment trusts offer regular savings plans that would fit Ms Kellsâ€™s needs. Scottish Mortgage investment trust is a Â£8.3 billion fund that seeks to deliver long-term growth through a diversified portfolio. The annual charge of the fund is about 0.37 per cent and its largest holdings are companies such as Amazon, Netflix and the Asian giants Alibaba and Tencent holdings. It has an enviable track record of delivering long-term growth to shareholders.  â€œMs Kellsâ€™s wish to invest in her childrenâ€™s long-term future is a wonderful opportunity to introduce them to the wider world of investment and long-term savings. Her children may have their own views about investment and may like to invest in a â€˜positive changeâ€™ type of fund or one with a socially responsible investment approach â€” that is the case with one of my children. Baillie Gifford, the fund manager of the Scottish Mortgage trust, also offers a positive change fund in this area.  â€œYou may also consider using a Junior Isa (Jisa) wrapper for the investment. You can put up to Â£4,260 a year into a Jisa and any capital gains or income produced are free of further taxation.â€  Andrew Hagger, the founder of advice site moneycomms.co.uk  â€œCash savings are Ms Kellsâ€™s safest option, but over the long term stocks and shares-based investing should deliver a healthier return.  â€œFor a risk-free option, the best cash-based regular savings accounts are offered to current account customers of Nationwide Building Society, First Direct and M&S Bank. All three pay 5 per cent interest, so are worth considering.  â€œIf Ms Kells takes the investment route, ideally she should invest in stock markets for at least five or ten years. This will help to overcome any short-term volatility.  â€œShe can invest Â£50 in stock-market funds such as unit trusts and investment companies through a regular savings plan.  â€œIt makes sense for her to keep the three investment pots separate because itâ€™s unlikely that they will all be required at the same time.  â€œMs Kells can invest cheaply and easily through an online fund platform such as Alliance Trust, Cavendish Online, Chelsea Financial Services or Fidelity Funds Network. Most of these online brokers offer tools to help you to choose the right investment fund, or you can invest in a pre-selected investment portfolio based on different levels of risk.  â€œBoth Cavendish Online and Fidelity offer ready-made funds but, importantly, Ms Kells can select the level of risk she feels comfortable with.â€  Rachel Springall, personal finance analyst at Money Facts, the data specialist  â€œThere are a few options available to tuck away a nest egg for children until they become adults, such as investing in a Jisa. The best cash Jisa comes from Coventry Building Society and pays 3.5 per cent. Children cannot gain access to funds until they turn 18, when it reverts to an adult cash Isa, but they can take control of the account at 16.  â€œStocks and shares Jisas may be a more attractive alternative for savers who are prepared for a little risk. They can outperform cash returns. One Family even pays a Â£30 gift voucher when savers apply online. As with any fund, growth is never a guarantee, so seeking independent financial advice would be ideal to assess risk. You can find an adviser at unbiased.co.uk.  â€œAs James is already 17, he could open a Nationwide Flex One account instead of an adult Isa, and use the Flex One Regular Saver, which pays 3.5 per cent. However, he will have access to the money.  â€œAs Ms Kells would like to keep the cash untouched by her children until they turn 21, she could approach a solicitor to discuss locking savings or potential inheritance money into a trust before she approaches a financial adviser about investments.  â€œA bare trust would be ideal if she is prepared to allow her younger sons access when they turn 18 (16 in Scotland), otherwise she may need to consider a discretionary trust, where she can specify more clearly when funds can be released (older age/situation). She can search for a local solicitor using the Law Society ( solicitors.lawsociety.org.uk).  Kateâ€™s response  â€œThey make very interesting reading and I am certainly going to look into the suggestions in more detail. Thank you to the experts for providing their assistance in this complex area.â€  If you would like to appear in our column, email us at portfolio therapy@ thetimes.co.uk and please include yourphone number",1
 Trump plan offers 'short-term' insurance,"WASHINGTON - The Trump administration spelled out a plan on Tuesday to lower the cost of health insurance: give consumers the option of buying less coverage in exchange for reduced premiums.

The proposed regulations would expand an alternative to the comprehensive medical plans required under former President Barack Obama's health law. Individuals could buy so-called ""short-term policies for up to 12 months. But the coverage would omit key consumer protections and offer fewer benefits, making it unattractive for people with health problems.
The plans would come with a disclaimer that they don't meet the Affordable Care Act's safeguards, such as guaranteed coverage, 10 broad classes of benefits, and dollar limits on coverage. Insurers could charge more if a consumer's medical history discloses health problems.  Nonetheless, administration officials said they believe the short-term option will be welcomed by people who need an individual health insurance policy but don't qualify for the ACA's income-based subsidies.  Those in this largely middle-class crowd make too much for subsidies and have absorbed years of price hikes. Some say they now face monthly, mortgage-size payments of well over $1,000 for health insurance. Then they usually have to pay a deductible of several thousand dollars. Research indicates the uninsured rate among these customers is growing.  ""If you are not subsidized, the options can be really unaffordable for folks, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters. The administration estimates monthly premiums for a short-term plan could be about than one-third of what a comprehensive policy costs.  Democrats swiftly branded it a return to ""junk insurance, and the main insurance industry lobbying group said it was concerned the Trump plan could divide the healthy from the sick in the market and make it more expensive to cover those with health problems.  Democrats say the solution is to increase government subsidies, so that more middle-class people will be eligible for taxpayer assistance to buy comprehensive coverage. The Obama administration had limited short-term plans to periods of no longer than three months, making them impractical for many consumers.  Trump administration officials reject the notion that they're trying to undermine the ACA. Instead, they say they are trying to make things more workable for people who are not being helped by the health law.  The administration estimates that only about 100,000 to 200,000 people will drop coverage they now have under the ACA and switch to cheaper short-term policies. They also say they expect short-term plans could attract many people among the estimated 28 million who remain uninsured.  ""What we see right now is that there are healthy people sitting on the sidelines without coverage, and this is an opportunity to provide them with coverage, said Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which also administers the Obama-era health law.  A government economic analysis that accompanied the proposal forecast a moderate increase in premiums among customers sticking with their ACA plans through HealthCare.gov. Because subsidies are tied to the cost of premiums, taxpayers would end up spending more.  Administration officials said there's no final decision on whether consumers will have a legal right to renew coverage under one of the new short-term plans.  One major health insurance company, United Healthcare, is already positioning itself to market short-term plans.  But others in the industry see them as a niche product for people in life transitions, like being in-between jobs, moving to another state, or retiring before Medicare kicks in.  ""I certainly wouldn't recommend them to someone receiving a significant subsidy or who has ongoing health issues, but there are certain times and certain places where it makes sense, said Jeff Smedsrud, an insurance entrepreneur whose companies sell short-term plans.  Consumer advocates say customers should read the fine print carefully to make sure the plan will cover their expected bills.  The administration's proposal will be open for public comment for 60 days. Verma said she hopes the new rules will be finalized as soon as possible, meaning plans would be on the market later this year.  However, short-term coverage won't count as qualifying coverage under the Obama health law for 2018. That means consumers with such plans would legally be considered uninsured, putting them at risk of fines. That wouldn't be a problem next year, when repeal of the ACA requirement that most Americans have coverage takes effect.  Tuesday's proposal follows another administration regulation that would allow groups to offer ""association health plans also exempt from ACA requirements to small businesses and sole proprietors. Having failed to repeal ""Obamacare, Trump is now chipping away at it through regulations and waivers.  The plan doesn't affect people with job-based coverage, still the mainstay for workers and their families.",1
New loans provide a different property option  ,"HOMEBUYERS are about to be offered loans worth more than the property they intend to buy.  

Borrowers who opt for a Head Start Shared Equity loan from Mobius Financial Services will be offered loans worth between 2 and 5 per cent more than the property they want to buy, in return for sharing any capital gains with the lender.  
Mobius Financial Services is a subsidiary of Wizard Home Loans and the loan will be made available at Wizard Home Loans from late November.    The loan, available to owner-occupiers only, will help homebuyers pay for transaction costs such as legal fees, stamp duty and mortgage insurance as well as the property.    The funds for transaction costs do not need to be repaid until the loan is discharged.    But borrowers will have to share between 20 and 50 per cent of any capital gain with the lender the proportion will depend on how much is borrowed to pay for transaction costs.    Borrowers will be charged a variable rate of 7.69 per cent on the amount they borrow to pay for the property (not the money borrowed to pay for transaction costs).    It is likely the new loans will appeal to first-home buyers and recently divorced people.    Wizard Home Loans executive chairman Mark Bouris said the new loan would allow more people to enjoy the benefits of home ownership.    ""We've done analysis that shows that in a property market with steady price growth, unlike what we've seen in the past five years, a person who borrows 102 per cent of the purchase price comes out ahead of a renter who waits to save up a deposit and buy in three years time,"" Mr Bouris said.

Council top brass in West Dunbartonshire received half a million pounds in pay and other benefits in the last 12 months.
Three local authority employees received a total remuneration of over Â£100,000 a year, according to The Taxpayersâ€™ Allianceâ€™s (TPA) annual â€˜Council Rich Listâ€™.  In total, the council spent Â£513,013 in pay and pension contributions last year to four of their most senior staff members.  Joyce White OBE, West Dunbartonshire Councilâ€™s chief executive, received the highest salary of Â£124,956.  She also benefitted from Â£24,074 in pension contributions â€” taking her total package to Â£149,030 last year.  The other council employees who received more than Â£100,000 are Angela Wilson, strategic director of transformation and public sector reform, as well as Richard Cairns, strategic director of regeneration, environment and growth, who both took home salaries of Â£108,535.  They also both received Â£20,910 in pension contributions.  And Stephen West, strategic lead for resources, earned a salary of Â£88,116 and his pension contributions brought his total remuneration to Â£105,092.  The TPAâ€™s annual Town Hall Rich List is a council-by-council breakdown of local government executive pay deals.  According to the organisation, in 2018/19 there were at least 2,667 council employees who received total remuneration in excess of Â£100,000.  They say that is 226 more than in 2017/18, and the highest number since 2013/14.  According to the figures, Glasgow City Council had the highest number of employees earning over Â£150,000 at 12.  As residents of every local authority in the UK face increased council tax this month, the think-tank is calling for council tax to be frozen and local authority spending to be focused on frontline health and social care services.  West Dunbartonshire Council increased its council tax by almost five per cent this year which they said would help fund free school meals for every primary pupil.  John Oâ€™Connell, chief executive of the TaxPayersâ€™ Alliance, said: â€œThe coronavirus crisis means that frontline council services are more crucial than ever, but at the same time household budgets face an enormous squeeze from crushing council tax rises.  â€œThere are plenty of talented people in local authorities who are focused on delivering more for less but that is needed across the board.  â€œThe country needs every council to cut out waste and prioritise key services without resorting to punishing tax hikes on their residents.  â€œThese figures should shine a light on the town hall bosses whoâ€™ve got it right but also allow taxpayers to hold to account those who arenâ€™t delivering value for money at this critical time.â€  A council spokeswoman said: â€œThe salary of our chief executive and senior officers are both set nationally with the chief executiveâ€™s salary like other authorities linked to the population.  â€œThe chief executive is ultimately responsible for leading and managing hundreds of services including education, social work and housing as well as 6000 employees and a revenue budget of more than Â£200m and multimillion pound capital investments to deliver regeneration and economic development in the West Dunbartonshire area.  â€œThe council has had a programme in place since 2015 to reduce the number of senior managers in the organisation and year on year this is generating significant savings with the latest reduction in 2019.â€",1
Tom Selby: FCA right to focus on costs and charges in value-for-money push,"There was more than a little, â€˜you don't say, Mr Holmes' about the Financial Conduct Authority's (FCA's) latest missive on delivering value-for-money in the defined contribution (DC) pensions market, writes Tom Selbey, who takes a look at the new rules for IGCs...

The regulator is keen to ensure independent governance committees (IGCs) and governance advisory arrangements (GAAs) - two of the more recent additions to financial services acronym bingo - adequately assess whether workplace pensions and the recently-introduced investment pathways are delivering value for investors.
Specifically, from September 2022 IGCs and GAAs will need to:  * Take into account three key elements of value-for-money: costs and charges; investment performance; and services provided (including member communications)  * Assess and report on value-for-money, particularly through comparison with other options on the market  * Consider, as far as they are able to, whether an alternative scheme or schemes would offer better value and inform the pension provider or the pathway investment provider if so. If they are not satisfied with the pension provider's response, they will need to inform the relevant employer where this could make a difference to the outcome of members of the scheme  * Set out their overall assessment in their reports about whether the scheme or pathway investment provides value-for-money  * Explain how they have assessed value-for-money in their reports and keep relevant evidence they relied upon for at least six years.  While it is probably obvious to most in the market - and certainly to any practising financial adviser - that value is about more than just cost, it is helpful that it is explicitly spelled out in black and white by the regulator.  The three value-for-money metrics set out by the FCA feel like broadly the right ones and should give governance committees enough latitude to consider other things that might be important to members such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and choice.  Lack of competition in workplace pensions  The role of governance committees is particularly important in the workplace pensions market, where millions of people have been nudged into saving for retirement through automatic enrolment.  A sizeable chunk of these people will not have engaged at all with their pension and will simply be rolled into their default investment fund.  Indeed, many may also take little interest in their retirement income options either and it is these â€˜double defaulters' who are the key target market for investment pathways reforms introduced in February.  In the SIPP market, by contrast, people who have actively chosen to save for retirement - and often picked investments already on this basis - have not flocked to pathways investments. It remains a bone of contention that, despite the very clear difference between the self-directed market and the auto-enrolment market, the pathways requirements have been applied in a uniform manner.  Because of the lack of competitive pressures in the auto-enrolment market - particularly where there isn't a corporate adviser in place to hold a scheme's feet to the fire - governance committees were introduced to act on behalf of the â€˜buy-side' (i.e. auto-enrolment members).  Hubris key danger as focus drifts from charges  While most agree costs and charges are just part of the value-for-money equation, they remain key and one of the few elements of retirement planning savers have total control over.  It is therefore important the price savers pay for their pensions remains at the top of the agenda, as even fairly small differences can add up to tens of thousands of pounds in lost retirement income.  Governance committees and the 0.75% default fund charge cap may act to shield members to a degree, but now is not the time for policymakers to rest on their laurels.  There is no particular reason why 0.75% should remain the long-term â€˜right' price for auto-enrolment pensions, and as providers build assets it is crucial the benefits of scale are passed onto customers rather than being swallowed up.  It was therefore somewhat concerning to read that the Productive Finance Group Working Group - whose members include the Treasury, the Bank of England and the FCA - believes there has been an â€˜excessive' focus on costs and charges in workplace DC pensions.  The context of this is the Government's desire to boost the UK economy by driving pension assets to illiquid investments, but the rhetoric feels at odds with the direction of policy in the last decade or so.  It is of course the case that value is a complex concept with many elements that need to be considered. But for governance committees to be effective, it is critical costs and charges remain front-and-centre of the debate.

"Nashville Promoter Pulls Off a Career Switch; Risky Cost-Cutting Move Succeeds, but a Financial Planner Knocks Her Portfolio","Kate Dore believes slashing expenses can lead to a better quality of life.

The 30-year-old Nashville resident knows this firsthand.
For about 7Â½ years, Ms. Dore worked 60 to 80 hours a week, traveling around the country promoting entertainers. She liked the perks of going to comedy shows and concerts. The frequent-flier miles were nice, too.  However, she wanted to work less and be at home more.  â€œI was starting to feel burned out,"" she says.  So, last year she set a radical goal for herself: quit her job and find a new career. She knew it was a risky moveâ€”especially for someone who owned a home. But keeping her promotional job, she decided, would not leave her enough time and energy to actively pursue a new path.  Before quitting, she saved more than 50% of her paycheck for over a year. She had no college debt or other personal debt. â€œI don't believe in credit-card debt,"" she says.  Her 2006 Toyota, with over 70,000 miles, was already fully paid for. â€œI don't feel the need to get a new car just to say I have the latest one,"" she says.  She also made sure she would still be able to pay the mortgage on the home she bought about five years ago. She refinanced her 30-year mortgage to a 15-year 3.25% fixed-rate mortgage. With roughly $73,000 in equity on the 1,500-square-foot home she bought for $167,000, she felt confident she could make the payments.  To further prepare, she dropped her cable service, cut back her cellphone bill, found cheaper car insurance and ate at home more. When friends wanted to meet, she says, she would suggest coffee instead of dinner.  Having roughly $19,000 in a mix of stocks and index funds and $40,000 in a Roth IRA in stock index funds also gave her the peace of mind.  So last August, she quit her job and started looking for a new career.  Soon after, a friend offered her part-time customer-service work. Realizing she had a lot more free time then she expected, Ms. Dore took the job and now works four to 28 hours a week.  She says she liked the flexibility the role offered her, and the benefits.  â€œThey have a great 401(k),"" she says.  Meanwhile, her search for a more permanent job paid off last month, when she accepted a full-time position as a social-media specialist for a technology company. The new job pays about as much as her old one. But she still plans to keep up the part-time work and to continue a personal-finance blog she started in 2013.  Looking forward, she hopes to generate more income from her investments. She'd also like to pay off her home and again save 50% of her income.  â€œThe more I save now, the less I'll have to work in the future,"" she says.  Advice from the pro: â€œMs. Dore has masterfully avoided the trap of debt in one's youth,"" says David Blain, a fee-only financial planner in New Bern, N.C. Her house purchase appears to be appropriate for her situation as well, he says. In general, the planner adds, her approach to money is right.  â€œIf you don't set goals, it's much more difficult to pass on dinners out, the new car, big house, etc.,"" he says. â€œKate set a courageous goal and went for it. That's the purpose of money.""  However, Mr. Blain says he never would have advised Ms. Dore to quit her job, considering all of the equity funds in her portfolio. If she plans to go without an income again, he says, she should have a decent amount of stable assets, like short-term bonds, despite the minimal yields. Even a small allocation of fixed income increases the long-term compounded return, he says.  Mr. Blain advises against owning individual stocks. â€œThere are so many excellent diversified funds and ETFS that it isn't worth the risk,"" he says. But her portfolio shouldn't be all equity funds either, even at her age, he says.  Ms. Dore should be maxing out her 401(k), or at least funding it enough to earn the employer match, he says. She should also keep up her regular Roth contributions.  And while Ms. Dore continues to blog about her personal finances online, he says she should make sure she has good insurance coverage. Mr. Blain suggests checking whether her homeowners policy has a rider that covers identity theft. He also recommends purchasing credit locks from the major credit bureaus, which make it harder for someone to open accounts in her name.

The best energy comparison sites: how to compare gas and electric for cheaper bills,"It pays to switch energy provider - here are the best energy comparison sites in the UK

Energy comparison is tricky. There are over 70 energy suppliers in the UK, each offering a number of different tariffs to choose between â€“ which makes comparing gas and electricity deals yourself a long, laborious task. (We know, weâ€™ve done it.) That's why when it comes to reducing your energy prices, we recommend using one of the best energy comparison sites instead.
Standard energy prices are now capped by the regulator, but itâ€™s a fact that the best energy deals are still found by switching energy supplier. You could save hundreds of pounds every year, especially if youâ€™re one of the roughly 15m UK households on a standard variable or default tariff. So which is the best energy comparison site â€“ and how do you switch? That's where we can help.  How to switch energy provider  Using an energy comparison service is easy. Simply share some basic details about your home and current energy use, and in less than two minutes youâ€™ll be shown a range of gas and electric quotes to help you save money on your bills. Here's how you do it...  * Choose one of the best energy comparison sites from the list below  * Supply details about your home and current energy use  * Browse the results  * Switch to the tariff you choose via the price comparison site  How to choose the best energy comparison site  The best energy comparison sites are Ofgem-accredited, so make sure you look for confirmation of this before choosing a service. It means the energy prices and options youâ€™re shown have been calculated fairly, in an unbiased way â€“ and that the service will have an effective complaints process, too.  Bear in mind that most independent energy comparison sites will initially show you only a list of tariffs they can switch you to. That's because energy comparison sites make money by charging a fee to the suppliers every time they complete an energy switch. These commercial relationships keep the energy comparison free for customers, and enable the sites to handle the energy switch for you â€“ making it quick, efficient and hassle-free. They also allow the best energy comparison sites to negotiate exclusive deals that you wonâ€™t be offered directly by an energy supplier  However, often the very cheapest deals are ones they canâ€™t switch you to (youâ€™ll need to go directly to the energy supplier) so make sure you filter your search results to show all plans. Here's our pick of the best energy comparison sites out there...  The 3 best energy comparison sites in the UK  1. Money Supermarket  The best energy comparison site in the UK overall  Claimed savings in our test: Â£479 - Â£504 | Founded: 1998 | Ofgem accredited: yes | Exclusive deals: yes  Compare energy prices at Money SupermarketVery easy to useAsked more questions for accurate quotesExcellent customer reviews Cheapest deals shown were the same as other sites  When it comes to energy comparison, we think independent price comparison service Money Supermarket is the best energy comparison site out there â€“ both for domestic and business customers. Itâ€™s reliable: Money Supermarket is fully accredited by Ofgem, and boasts an impressive 4.5 out of 5 star rating from over 1,000 customer reviews over on TrustPilot.  The website is also easy to use. Simply enter your postcode and energy habits, and youâ€™ll be shown a list of the best energy plans in your area â€“ we were shown over 50 tariffs that MoneySupermarket could switch us to, plus many more deals that we could switch to directly through the supplier.  Interestingly, all three energy comparison sites in this guide told us that e.onâ€™s Fix Online Exclusive v30 deal (a 12-month fixed-rate contract) was the cheapest we could get. But each calculated our projected energy costs for the next 12 months differently, and therefore showed us a slightly different estimated annual saving from the same deal.  While we don't yet know which site was most accurate, we did feel reassured about the consensus over which deal to choose. Overall, we found MoneySupermarket to be the easiest energy comparison site to use. The results were presented very clearly, and we would happily use it again to switch energy provider.  2. USwitch  A beautifully designed energy comparison site that's easy to use  Claimed savings in our test: Â£495.30 - Â£519.65 | Founded: 1998 | Ofgem accredited: yes | Exclusive deals: yes  Compare energy prices at USwitchQuick to useGood range of quotesWell-presented results  USwitch is another of the UKâ€™s best energy comparison sites. Itâ€™s been fully accredited by Ofgem since 2006, and boasts an impressive 4.5 out of 5 star rating from over 4,000 customer reviews over on TrustPilot. Itâ€™s also authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority, and a Feedo 2020 Gold Trusted Service award winner.  Like MoneySupermarket, USwitch's energy comparison service is very easy to use: it took us less than a minute to provide our details. (Alternatively, you can call the service for free and talk about your energy switch over the phone.)  As we flagged above, USwitch calculated a slightly higher projected annual energy cost for us than Money Supermarket (Â£1,080 versus Money Supermarket's Â£1,065), so although the cheapest deal it showed us was the same one Money Supermarket found, USwitch predicted that our annual saving would be Â£16 higher, at Â£495.30 (or Â£519.65, if we looked at tariffs that the site couldnâ€™t switch us too, as well).

State to launch savings plan for disabled,"MONTPELIER â€” State Treasurer Beth Pearce says the state is setting up a tax-free savings program for disabled Vermonters that will allow them to save for future needs without falling victim to federal benefits cliffs.

The VT-ABLE savings plan was created under the Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, signed by former President Barack Obama, according to Pearce. She said the launch of the Vermont program, expected to begin in the next couple of months, will make Vermont one of a handful of states to offer such a program.
""I am excited to announce that we have reached an agreement to launch Vermont's ABLE savings plan for Vermonters who experience a disability,"" Pearce said in a statement. ""Once launched in early 2017, these accounts will allow eligible Vermonters to save adequate money for future needs in federal tax-deferred accounts. We are expanding access to savings, independence, and enabling individuals to save the dollars they have earned through employment.""  Pearce said people with disabilities have been precluded from saving money in the past because of federal benefits cliffs that cause them to lose access to needed assistance. Before passage of the ABLE Act, those with disabilities who receive any means-tested benefits, such as Social Security or Medicaid, could not have more than $2,000 in savings. The ""asset limits"" forced people in some cases to live in poverty or prevented them from  working or owning homes, according to Pearce's office.  Under the ABLE Act, people with disabilities will be able to save up to $14,000 per year for disability-related expenses like housing, transportation, employment training and other needs. People will be able to save up to $426,000 through the program during their lifetime.  ""VT-ABLE will help further the goal of empowering more Vermonters to achieve a lifetime of financial well-being,"" Pearce said.  The program will allow Vermonters to enroll in a savings plan through a secure web portal. A range of saving plans will be available to eligible Vermonters and allow online electronic funds transfers, withdrawals and a debit card.  The accounts available through the program are investment accounts rather than bank accounts and are similar to 529 college savings plans or 401K accounts. They do provide the transactional capabilities of a checking account.  The program will offer five investment options, including four Vanguard Target Risk Mutual Funds or an FDIC-insured account through Fifth Third Bank, according to Pearce's office.  Each plan has a monthly account maintenance fee of $5 per month, or $60 per year. Vermonters using the program must also pay an asset-based fee of between 0.19 percent and 0.34 percent, depending on the investment option they choose.  The VT-ABLE program will be administered through a partnership with the Ohio State Treasurer's Office. The platform was chosen ""after a lengthy vetting process"" by the Vermont ABLE Task Force, which met throughout 2015 and 2016 to plan the program, according to Pearce.  Tim Lueders-Dumont, Pearce's policy director, said utilizing the existing platform in Ohio was the best option for Vermonters.  ""We looked at a range of options before entering into a partnership with the Ohio State Treasurer's Office. The task force came together to find a solution that would enhance the well-being of Vermonters who have waited a long time for the opportunity to save for their current and future needs,"" he said.  Advocates for the disabled in Vermont say the program will provide more flexibility.  ""ABLE programs meet several needs. Parents and other relatives want a flexible, low-cost way to put aside money for the future of a family member with a disability,"" Kirsten Murphy, executive director of the Vermont Developmental Disabilities Council, said in a statement.  ""Working adults with disabilities want to keep what they earn without frequent adjustments to benefits like Social Security, which has a $2,000 asset limit. In either case, the savings remains in the name of the person with the disability, which is empowering,"" she said. ""We should all learn the importance of saving.""  neal.goswami @rutlandherald.com",1
That old fixed interest debate is back   ,"AS the stockmarket starts to look positive again, it's time for stretched home borrowers to ask: ""Should I fix my interest rate?""   

In the past week about half a dozen people asked me this and it is the question I hate the most.   
It is also a double-barrelled tough question because the second part is: ""And for how long?""     To answer you have to really know the debts, income, expenses and other circumstances of the borrower. Plus you need to know their risk profiles -- thrillseeker or nervous nellie? And their goals.     Let's make it simple and say you want to minimise loan repayments and not cop another two 0.25per cent rises on your home loan interest rate.     Start with what you are paying now and find out if it costs you to break your current loan. One of the best two-year fixed rates on   www.infochoice.com.au   was 7.49per cent at Onedirect.     One of the best three-year rates was 7.24per cent at Meridian Money but with other costs its real rate was 7.56per cent.     (Always find out what the true rate is by adding in the fees. Websites such as Infochoice and Cannex show you this.) Okay, will interest rates rise over the next year or two? There's a good chance -- inflation's the key.     Before the stockmarket problems many economists thought another rise this year was on the cards. With the Yanks likely to cut rates in September, after cutting a rate used for banks borrowing from the US central bank, there is less support for another rise here this year.     Gail Kelly, the St George Bank boss heading to the top job at Westpac, this week said she thought interest rates would stay where they are this year.     She may be wrong but she would not say it if she thought it was a long shot. Also the cash rate at 6.5per cent is at an 11-year high.     And elsewhere plenty of economists think we are close to the top of the interest rate cycle. That means one or two more rises could happen but that should be it.     Personally, I think two more rises, with incomes stretched to meet very high debt repayments, would create a recession and bring about rate cuts.

Help and support from Citizens Advice,"Q. Iâ€™M 55 and looking into my plans for retirement. I want to cash-in part of my defined contribution pension pot worth Â£60,000 but Iâ€™m confused about tax. How much can I take out of my pension pot tax-free and how much tax will I pay on the rest?

A. Pensions are taxable income, however special rules mean you can usually take up to 25 per cent of your pension pot tax-free.
You can take your 25 per cent tax-free lump sum out of your pension in one go. For your pension pot of Â£60,000, if you take a 25 per cent tax-free lump sum youâ€™ll get Â£15,000 tax-free.  For the other Â£45,000, youâ€™ll need to buy an annuity or drawdown product, which is subject to tax.  If you donâ€™t want to take your 25 per cent tax-free lump sum in one go, another option is to take multiple cash lump sums (UFPLS), rather than buying an annuity or a drawdown product.  If you do this, you will get 25 per cent tax-free of each lump sum. For example, if you were to take Â£1,000 per month out of your pension, Â£250 would be tax-free. The remaining Â£750 is taxable.  How much tax you pay on the rest of your pension will depend on how much you â€œearnâ€ in any one tax year. This includes your state pension and some earnings from investments, such as property or savings.  If your total income is less than your personal allowance of Â£11,000, you wonâ€™t pay any tax. If it is above Â£11,000 youâ€™ll be taxed at 20, 40 or 45 per cent as usual.  To find out more about your pension options, visit pensionwise.gov.uk  Copyright Citizens Advice.

Carney,"Host(s): SANDIE RINALDO

SANDIE RINALDO: A word of warning to homeowners tonight. Canada's top banker says the days of selling your house to fund your retirement could be coming to an end. Mark Carney says the real estate market won't stay hot forever and those who are counting on cashing in could discover their nest egg is empty. CTV's Richard Madan explains.
RICHARD MADAN (Reporter): Most Canadian homeowners have long believed their investment will pay off down the road. Christine Moynihan is about to sell the house she's lived in for 17 years, and what she earns from it will fund a big chunk of her retirement income.  CHRISTINE MOYNIHAN (Homeowner): It has been an investment, and it has been one of the key things that, one of the key ways that people invested for their future. MADAN: But Canada's outgoing top banker says that way of thinking has to change.  MARK CARNEY (Bank of Canada Governor): To not assume that the value of your house is going to continue to creep. MADAN: Mark Carney says rapidly rising home prices just aren't normal and Canadians should stop banking on home values as a retirement funds.  CARNEY: Real wealth is built through innovation and it's gained through hard work. It's not through some magical asset reflation.  FILM CLIP: Canada faced a critical housing shortage at war's ends.  CARNEY: Homeownership took off in the early 1940s, and for generations values kept rising. But some experts now warn that cycle is ending.  ROBERT WARREN (Business Analyst): The new generation coming up doesn't have the same level of earnings and income that we do, so you're not going to see the big pushup in real estate that we've seen in the past.  CARNEY: Canada's red hot housing market started cooling last year after Ottawa tightened mortgage rules. But the real estate association says people shouldn't stop buying a home because in the long term it's a solid investment.  CAMERON MUIR (BC Real Estate Association): We go through periods in which prices are flat, or decline in real terms, and then we go through periods in which home prices accelerate due to much better economic conditions. CARNEY: So, as Carney urges Canadians to get their house in order, he's packing up to leave. Carney starts his new job as Bank of England Governor in July. Sandie.  RINALDO: Thank you, Richard.",1
Barron's Mailbag: No Relief in Debt  ,"To the Editor:  

The Editorial Commentary of Dec. 5, ""Indebted to Debt,"" concludes that the bloated credit-card balances of America's families are ""a necessary evil"" that enable people to ""survive financial mishaps."" With all due respect, that is like saying another hit of heroin will enable an addict to have a good day. To rationalize credit-card debt as necessary misses the bigger problem: Average Americans are consuming way beyond their means. They spend because they believe they need a car that makes them adventurous, jewelry that makes them attractive, and that a 42-inch high-definition plasma television is a necessity. Americans spend because they buy what advertisers are selling, and they want it now.  
Don Allen Wilks    Euless, Texas    To the Editor:    Thanks for pointing out that the overwhelming majority of borrowers use debt responsibly and for important purchases, not just whimsical consumption. The commentary also brought to mind a statement by the late real-estate developer William Zeckendorf who, when asked about credit limits accompanied by lower interest rates, said something like: ""Better to be alive at 18% than dead at 12%"".

It all adds up and up  ,"PERSONAL FINANCE  

JUDGING by the volume of correspondence I received, the recent column on the miracle of compounding struck a chord with many readers.  
And that's great, because the power of compounding is seldom taught in schools and its effects truly are miraculous.    Of course, there were sceptics, with some readers writing to say that it's hard to obtain a return of 10 per cent after tax, which was the rate I used in the examples.    Yes, it's not easy to get high returns in the present low-inflation environment, but don't forget the wonderful words of Jim Rohn some people are picking the fruits while others are studying the roots.    Too many people fail to get their investment plans under way because they get so immersed in the fine details that they miss the big picture and never put their ideas into action.    The rate of return you can achieve depends on many factors, which include the asset purchased, the rate of inflation and the tax effectiveness of the vehicle used, so it is going to vary continually.    However, the major lessons of compounding are timeless. How much money you end up with depends on three major factors: time, rate and the sum you invest.    When you are investing for a short term the rate matters little. For example, if you invested $1000 a month for two years at 5 per cent you would have $25,200; at 12 per cent $26,500 just $1300 more.    However, continue the investment program over a long period and the variation is immense.    Think about investing that same $1000 a month for 30 years. At 5 per cent your portfolio would be worth $832,000 but at 10 per cent $2.26 million. That's a difference of nearly $1.5 million.    Is a 30-year term relevant in this modern age? Absolutely! Many people who retire at 60 now may well live to 90. If they don't understand time and rate they face the danger of living longer than their money.    The essence of compounding is that you leave the earnings to grow with the investment instead of spending them. Here's how it works.    Let's assume that you and a friend had $20,000 each invested in a good share that was selling at $4 and producing capital gain of 7 per cent per annum with income of 4 per cent per annum.    If your friend had instructed the company to credit dividends to his or her bank account, the $800 of income would almost certainly become mixed up with all the other money and frittered away on consumer spending.    In contrast, if you had joined the company's dividend reinvestment plan your dividend would have been used to buy another 200 shares. You now have an extra $800 working for you, which is why your portfolio will grow much faster than your friend's as time passes.    Suppose, 10 years ago, you invested $100,000 into a managed fund that matched the All Ordinaries Index. If you had spent all your dividends from your investment you would now have $191,000. But if you had reinvested all those dividends your portfolio would now be worth $279,000 thanks to the miracle of compound interest.    So what strategies can you use to start enjoying the benefits of compounding?    For starters, any investment, or investment vehicle, that allows you to let the earnings stay grafted to the original investment. Superannuation funds and insurance bonds are ideal because the funds pay the tax on your behalf then credit the after-tax profits to your account, making it virtually impossible to get your hands on it.    Managed funds are perfect as long as you reinvest dividends, and shares are good if the company has a dividend reinvestment scheme. If they don't offer this facility a way out is to bank all dividends in a separate bank account and buy more shares as the balance builds up.    Never forget that the secret to investing is to control as many assets as you can as soon as possible.    This is why borrowing for growth assets like property and shares is so powerful. Think about it it would take you forever to save that first $100,000 but you can rent $100,000 for a tax-deductible $6500 a year and have $100,000 working for you immediately.    That's really getting the miracle of compounding working for you.    Noel Whittaker is joint managing director of Whittaker Macnaught Pty Ltd, AFSL Number 246519. email noelwhit@gil.com.au  ",1
"Home Sellers Are Scarce as Rates Rise Higher Low Rates, Rates, After Years of Low Mortgage Rates, Home Sellers Are Scarce -- WSJ","Homeowners wearing the 'golden handcuffs' of low mortgage costs are reluctant to sell their homes now that rates are much higher 


By Nicole Friedman 
Homeowners with low mortgage rates are balking at the prospect of selling their homes to borrow at much higher rates for their next homes, a development that could limit the supply of houses for sale for years to come.  Housing inventory has risen from record lows earlier this year as more homes sit on the market longer. But the number of newly listed homes in the four weeks ended Sept. 18 fell 20% year-over-year, according to real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp. That is an indication that sellers who don't need to sell are staying on the sidelines, economists say.  Larry and Corina Lewis of Tarrytown, N.Y., have two children and expect to need a bigger home in the next few years. But their current 30-year mortgage rate is 2.75%.  ""The thought of giving this up in order to pay double in interest, that's a nauseating thought for me,"" Mr. Lewis said. Even if the average mortgage rate falls from its current level, he said, ""I still don't see it ever getting quite that low.""  Some homeowners will always need to sell due to job relocations, divorces, deaths or other life events. Yet if those who have the option not to move decide to stay put, that could keep the inventory of homes for sale below normal levels and keep home prices elevated, even if demand remains low.  The lack of housing inventory is one of the major reasons home prices have remained near record highs, despite seven straight months of declining sales as interest rates have roughly doubled since the start of the year.  ""I like to call it the 'golden handcuffs' of mortgage rates,"" said Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American Financial Corp. ""You've got existing homeowners who are sitting on these rock-bottom rates, and what is their financial incentive to move and lock into a rate that's potentially as much as 3 percentage points higher than what they've locked into?""  Millions of Americans locked in historically low borrowing rates in recent years when the Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates low. As of July 31, nearly nine of every 10 first-lien mortgages had an interest rate below 5% and more than two-thirds had a rate below 4%, according to mortgage-data firm Black Knight Inc. About 83% of those mortgages are 30-year fixed rates, Black Knight said.  The Fed reversed course and started to raise rates in March in an effort to tame inflation. Those rate increases, including another three-quarters of a percentage point on Wednesday, have rippled through the mortgage market. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.29% in the week ended Sept. 22, up from 2.88% a year earlier, according to housing-finance agency Freddie Mac.  Alyssa and Brandon McDuffie reached out to a real-estate agent this summer to explore selling their Raleigh, N.C., house, which they bought in 2018. The agent said they could probably sell for at least $200,000 more than the $312,000 they paid. The couple decided to hold off until at least next year because home prices are high and they are reluctant to give up their 3.375% mortgage rate.  ""With home prices going up the way they are, if we sold our house, it would make a great profit, but we're going to eat up that profit in another home we're going to buy for a higher interest rate,"" Mr. McDuffie said.  In an analysis of four major metro areas -- Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington -- Redfin found that homeowners with mortgage rates below 3.5% were less likely to list their homes for sale in August compared with homeowners with higher rates.  Economists say it is difficult to predict how much the increase in mortgage rates could reduce home listings, because rates haven't climbed this rapidly in decades. The National Association of Realtors estimated that when mortgage rates increased in 2018, the existing-home inventory was 12% lower than it otherwise would have been.  ""I really don't see inventory rising,"" said Lawrence Yun, NAR's chief economist. By NAR's measurement, which includes homes that are under contract, the supply of homes for sale at the end of August fell slightly from July.  Sam Khater, chief economist for Freddie Mac, said an analysis he did in 2016 of past periods of rising rates showed a decline in sales in which buyers' prior mortgage rates were more than 2 percentage points below their new mortgage rates. But there was no change if the difference between the rates was less than 2 percentage points.  Many sellers today have significant equity in their current homes, which can help them put down larger down payments on their new purchases to offset the effect of the higher interest rates. Those who are moving from high-cost markets to cheaper areas might also be less sensitive to higher rates, Mr. Khater said.  Still, about one-third of about 1,000 homeowners surveyed by John Burns Real Estate Consulting in July said they felt locked into their current homes due to rising rates.  Among the 197 homeowners who said they were saving to buy a home, only 15% said they would be willing to take on a new mortgage rate of 6% or higher, the survey showed.  Craig Young and Kathryn Cataldo hoped to sell their house in Huntsville, Ala., this summer, but they have pushed back their plans in response to the market slowdown.  ""I feel like we've missed the sweet spot in being able to sell our house, "" said Mr. Young, who is 64. They are not in a rush to move, but the house has a steep driveway that could become difficult for them to navigate as they age, he said.  ""If [mortgage rates] keep going up, I'm going to hang on,"" he said.

20 Ways to Earn Extra Cash for the 2014 Holidays,"Coming up with extra cash to cover Christmas presents or take the family to Grandma's house isn't as hard as it seems.

Consider a seasonal job for the holiday season. 2014 is shaping up as a great year to find work for the holidays, and it's not just retailers that are hiring.
Plenty of other legitimate moneymaking opportunities are out there for you to capitalize on at your convenience. Some are simply good for a fast buck, while others could turn into consistent streams of income after the holidays. Find out which cash-generating ideas could work best for you.  Be a Mystery Shopper  You can get paid up to $20 per shopping experience if you agree to shop at a store and provide detailed feedback on customer service, merchandise, and various quality-control metrics. Start by visiting the Mystery Shopping Providers Association's Web site to see a database of jobs with legitimate companies, and be sure to see the association's tips for avoiding mystery shopping scams.  Sell Unwanted Electronics  Don't leave smart phones, tablets, computers or game consoles you're no longer using in a desk drawer or the back of a closet. You can easily cash in on your unwanted electronics -- even damaged items -- by selling them online.  Sell used smart phones and Apple products at Gazelle.com and get paid by check, PayPal or an Amazon gift card. BuyMyTronics.com pays cash for smart phones, digital cameras, tablets, game consoles and more. You can sell smart phones, tablets, laptops and video games to NextWorth.com for cash or take items to one its partner stores, such as Target, and get store credit. At uSell, you can sell smart phones, tablets, game consoles, video games and textbooks. You get paid by check or through PayPal. Shipping with all of these sites is free.  If you want to buy electronics for a gift, however, check out our great gadget gifts of 2014.  Search for Unclaimed Property  Federal and state coffers hold billions of dollars' worth of unclaimed property. Some of it could be yours, but it's up to you to track down the cash.  The feds hang on to tax refunds that are returned to the IRS because of mailing-address errors or that are never claimed by taxpayers because they didn't file returns. The government also holds on to forgotten savings bonds, government-guaranteed mortgage-insurance refunds and government pensions that were never claimed. There's no central database, so you'll have to check with individual federal agencies about missing funds.  State governments hold onto uncashed dividend checks, returned utility deposits, unclaimed state-tax refunds and uncollected insurance benefits, among other things. (If a bank or other payer doesn't have your last known address on file, it will turn over your money to the state in which the institution is incorporated.) You can search for unclaimed property held by states at Unclaimed.org and Missingmoney.com.  Adjust Your Tax Withholding  If you got a big tax refund for 2013, you're not alone: The average refund is about $2,750 in 2014. Why wait until the spring to get the money you really need now? If you're a refund-receiving taxpayer, you've already overpaid your taxes via your initial 2014 paychecks -- banking at least a small refund next spring. Fix your tax withholding now to stop that refund from growing by delivering more of your money to you as you earn it.  Simply ask your company's payroll office for a W-4 form to claim extra allowances, and your take-home pay should rise on your next payday. To see how many allowances you should claim, try our easy-to-use withholding calculator.  Teach Lessons  If you have a special skill -- whether it's the ability to play an instrument well, paint like Picasso or explain calculus in a way anyone can understand -- you may be able to make money sharing it with others. For example, you could earn about $15 to $30 an hour tutoring individual kids or college students if you speak a second language or have great math, science or writing skills.  Or teach a full class. For example, stay-at-home mom Allison Millet, from Bowling Green, Ky., has transformed a passion for fitness into a business to help pay family medical bills. The certified fitness instructor created Backyard Bootcamp and charges $100 per student per six-week session.  Advertise your services on school, campus and community bulletin boards or on online classifieds site Craigslist. And take advantage of social media sites, such as Facebook, to let people know about the lessons you're able to teach.  Be a Tour Guide  If you know a lot about the city where you live, you may be able to profit from your knowledge by guiding tours -- especially during the holiday travel season. For example, travel guide site Vayable lets anyone list a tour or experience that tells a unique story about a destination - from its art to its history to its food -- and earn money from bookings through the site. U.S. tours that are promoted on Vayable -- such as a San Francisco street-art tour or a Washington, D.C., White House tour led by a member of the White House press corps -- range in price from about $25 per person to $200 per person, though more-upscale experiences are priced even higher. Vayable takes a 15% cut of whatever you choose to charge travelers and provides online tools to manage reservations, accept credit-card payments and securely communicate with customers.  Get Paid for Your Opinions  Market-research firms are hired by big businesses to get inside the heads of consumers. Participation in an in-person focus group led by a moderator, such as those run by Delve, can earn you between $50 and $200.  In exchange for taking online and phone surveys, firms such as Harris Interactive and Schlesinger Associates offer rewards points redeemable for gift cards and merchandise. Beware scams, though. Legitimate firms won't charge a fee or ask you to cash a check and wire back part of the money.  Lawyers are getting in on the act, too. ""Online jurors"" can earn cash for giving their opinions on legal cases. EJury.com pays $5 to $10 per case. You'll need a PayPal account. At OnlineVerdict.com, where fees start at $20, payment is made by check.  Sell Gold and Silver for Scrap  If you have gold jewelry that isn't valuable as an antique or a designer piece, consider selling it for scrap. Keep in mind that most gold jewelry isn't pure, say 14-karat or 18-karat, so you'll need to calculate the melt value to get a better sense of its worth as scrap. The melt value reflects the actual amount of gold in the jewelry; a dealer will offer you a percentage of that value. Quotes will vary widely, so get several. See Smart Ways to Sell Your Gold to learn more.  The same goes for silver. Maybe you inherited a few sterling trays you never use. Assuming the trays hold no particular value to collectors, sell them for scrap rather than trying to sell them at a consignment store or online. Check with several metals dealers, both online and at storefront locations, to get quotes. Expect to receive about 85% to 90% of your silver's melt value.  Sell Gently Worn Clothing  If you or your family members have brand-name clothing, accessories or shoes that are in good condition but no longer being used, turn them into quick cash by selling them on consignment. Research the consignment shops in your area to find the right match for the types and styles of clothing you have to sell. Most consignment stores will price items at one-third of their retail value, and you'll likely get 50% of the price at which your items eventually sell. To learn more, see How to Sell Clothes on Consignment.  You might be able to get more for your used clothes by selling them online. For example, you can earn up to 80% of the resale value of women's and kids' clothing, shoes and handbags at fashion resale site thredUP.com. If you have high-end men's and women's clothing, jewelry, watches and accessories, try your luck with luxury consignment site The RealReal. You earn up to 70% of the resale value in cash. Or skip the middle-man and sell your used clothing on eBay, which will require more effort on your part but could result in a bigger return.  Join a Street Team  The weather outside may be frightful, but street teams still need energetic, outgoing helpers to promote products, films, albums, events and more by handing out samples, interacting with people on the street, or dressing as mascots. To get a job earning $20 to $25 an hour, sign up with a company such as Street Team Promotion which handles promotions in big cities nationwide. Make sure you get a contract that specifies when you'll get paid.  Be a Babysitter  Babysitting can be a fun way to put money in your pocket if you like kids, and considering it's the season for holiday parties, you may be in high demand. In big cities such as New York and Washington, expect to earn up to $20 an hour as a babysitter or nanny. (In small and midsize cities, the going rate is closer to $7 to $10 an hour.) Advertise your services on Craigslist, community bulletin boards, the public library or houses of worship.  Sell Excess Furniture  If you have an attic, garage or storage unit filled with furniture you're not using, unload those items for cash by selling them on Craigslist. (You might even end up saving the monthly cost of your storage unit.) You can list large items (free) on your local Craigslist classifieds, and buyers will come to you. Just be sure to insist on cash to avoid bounced checks. Take good photos, share key details and provide a concise description of what you're selling.  If you don't want the hassle of selling items yourself, take furniture and home accessories you no longer want to an upscale consignment store that gets a lot of traffic so that you can get top dollar for your items. Expect to split the profit 50/50 with the store. For more information, see What to Sell -- And Not to Sell -- at Consignment Shops .  Sell Collectibles Online  Perhaps you collected baseball cards (or stamps or coins) when you were young, and now they're just collecting dust. But they might be worth hundreds or thousands of dollars. One place to get top dollar for your collectibles and small items of value is eBay. Click on the ""register"" link in the top left corner of the homepage to create an account. Then visit the site's ""Seller Center"" to learn how to sell. You can list 50 items every month for free, and you'll pay a 10% fee on each item when it sells. Research prices for merchandise similar to what you plan to sell so that you can price your wares competitively. For more tips on how and where to sell valuable items, see 6 Things You Should Know About Collectibles.  Redeem Rewards Points  You could be sitting on an untapped source of cash if you haven't bothered to redeem your credit card rewards points lately. One-third of all rewards -- everything from airline miles to cash back -- worth a total of $16 billion go unredeemed each year, according to a study by marketing research firm Colloquy. Per household, that averages out to $205 worth of rewards a year that aren't redeemed.  The next-best thing to getting cash-for-points is a general-purpose gift card. At American Express, for example, 5,000 Membership Rewards points earns you a $25 AmEx gift card that's good in more than a million places. You can get more bang for your points by selecting a retailer-specific gift card -- often $50 for 5,000 points.  Sell Used Books  Stop letting your used books collect dust on a book shelf, and start selling them online. BookScouter.com makes it easy for you to get the best price for you books. Simply type in the ISBN from your book, and BookScouter.com scans prices from more than 40 book-buying sites to show you which ones are offering the most. For example, the highest price offered recently for a hardcover edition of The Goldfinch, which won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for fiction, was $8.75.  College textbooks can fetch a lot more. For example, some vendors recently were paying as much as $129 for Trigonometry by Ron Larson. Most other textbooks in good condition sell for $20 and up. ExtraBux.com, a price-comparison site, has found that Amazon.com offers the best buyback prices -- about 20% more than runnerup AbeBooks.com. (However, Amazon pays with gift cards only.) For more information, see Get the Best Price When Selling Back Textbooks.  Walk Dogs  Why not get a little exercise while you earn anywhere from $15 to $30 an hour? Working folks will pay plenty for you to take Rover or Scruffy on a daily stroll while they're at the office. Or consider pet-sitting for people while they're on vacation for a daily fee of $50 or more. Advertise your services in veterinarians' offices and on Craigslist. You can also team up with an existing dog-walking operation that handles client recruitment and scheduling. To find one, ask other dog walkers you encounter whether they're part of a group or check Craigslist.  Get Freelance Editorial Work  Sorry, Kiplinger.com isn't hiring. But plenty of media, corporate and nonprofit Web sites are looking for freelancers to write, edit or design content, for about $15 to $30 an hour. Freelancewriting.com and Freelance Writing Jobs provide a long list of freelance writing opportunities culled from several top sites. For $21 a month, you can join Mediabisto's freelance marketplace to post your qualifications and be contacted by media managers for work. Krop is a useful site for developers and designers; Freelance Photo Jobs consolidates listings for photographers; and DoNanza provides information on jobs for artists and other creators.  Sell Baked Goods  There are those who can bake. Then there are those who can't even make a cake from a mix without messing it up. They're the ones who have to rely on others to make the gingerbread men for their holiday party. If you can create tasty baked goods, then you can profit from others' lack of skills in the kitchen.  Laura Haley of Bowling Green, Ky., started making cupcakes as a way to keep herself occupied while staying with her dad when he was undergoing chemotherapy. She posted a picture of her cupcakes on Facebook and instantly received several orders from friends. Now she makes about $200 a month making cupcakes for others who hear about her through word of mouth or see pictures of her cupcakes on her Facebook page.  You also can find clients for your baked goods by volunteering to provide treats for your children's school functions or for church or other religious gatherings, or by selling them at a farmer's market, flea market or local festivals.  Participate in Clinical Trials  If you're willing to be a human guinea pig, you can pad your pockets by participating in clinical research trials. Compensation depends on the nature of the trial and the amount of time involved, but payment can range from $50 to more than $1,000, according to the Center for Information and Study on Clinical Research Participation.  Legitimate studies are sponsored by medical institutions and pharmaceutical companies. You'll be required to undergo a health screening to determine if you're eligible to participate. Come-ons for clinical trials litter the Internet. Many are scams. The safe play is to peruse studies that are actively recruiting participants at ClinicalTrials.gov, a database run by the National Institutes of Health. Search by location to identify local trials.  Cash in On Unused Gift Cards  About $44 billion worth of gift cards has gone unused over the past six years, according to gift card resale site Gift Card Granny. So grab the unwanted cards you have lying around your house, and turn them into cash by selling them online at sites such as Gift Card Granny, Cardpool and Junkcard. You won't get the full value of your card (up to 92% at best). But if you have no intention of using the card, it's like getting free money. Cards for gas stations, grocery stores and retail chains (such as Exxon, Safeway and Walmart) often bring the best offers.  Copyright 2014 The Kiplinger Washington Editors",1
"300,000 PEOPLE EXPECTED TO SELL RETIREMENT ANNUITY ONCE CHANGES COME INTO FORCE","Around 300,000 people are expected to sell their retirement annuity after a further pensions shake-up comes into force next year, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) documents show.

From April 2017, people who already have an annuity - which gives pensioners a guaranteed income - can sell it on for a lump sum.
The reforms will build on the pension freedoms introduced in 2015, which mean people aged 55 and over no longer have to use their pension pot to buy an annuity and instead they can have more choice over how they use their money. The 2015 reforms did not affect people who had already retired and had bought an annuity.  A tax consultation document published by HMRC on the plans for the secondary annuity market said: ""It is estimated that up to five million individuals receive payments under pension annuities and that some 300,000 of these individuals will choose to sell their annuity.""  As previously stated in the Budget, the Government expects a tax windfall of Â£960 million in the first two years of the new secondary annuity market, but it also predicts a revenue loss for the two subsequent years - meaning a net gain to the Exchequer of Â£665 million.  Tom McPhail, head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""This is potentially a double win for the Government, giving annuity holders the chance to exercise more control over their savings, and raising extra revenue in the process.  ""Our own research indicates a healthy appetite for this market, though that will in the end depend on what kind of price investors are offered in exchange for their annuity income.  ""There are still unanswered questions around the regulation of the market and how consumer protection could work; we need to make sure investors don't end up getting ripped off.""  Annuities have been controversial in recent years due to plunging rates and concerns that people were not shopping around to get the best deals, although they do act as a guarantee for pensioners that they will not out-live their savings.  Recent analysis from website Moneyfacts showed that average retirement incomes for people taking an annuity have plunged by nearly 10% since the new pension freedoms were launched. Moneyfacts previously said the new pension freedoms ""have proved counter-productive for retirees reluctant to take any risks with their pension pots as annuity providers have struggled to offer competitive pricing given the more limited business volumes at stake"".  ends  Gareth Shaw, head of consumer affairs at Saga Investment Services, said: ""There are thousands of over-50s who were forced to buy annuities with small pension savings, and are receiving such low incomes that they make absolutely no difference to their retirement earnings. It's not surprising to see that the Government expects to see such high levels of interest in annuity selling.  ""Research carried out by Saga found that 58% of people who wanted to sell their annuity were receiving such a small income they could do nothing meaningful with it.  ""Now the Government must ensure that the large numbers of people looking to sell their annuity get a good deal, and have the tools and information to be able to understand what's available - and what they're giving up.""  ends",1
NHS staff opting out of pensions,"CONCERNS have been raised over an ""epidemic"" of workers opting out of the NHS pension scheme.

Workers who opt out could be giving up pensions worth around nine times what they save, Royal London warned.
It said a recent Freedom of Information (FOI) request by the Health Service Journal found nearly a quarter of a million (245,561) NHS staff had opted out of the NHS pension scheme in the past three years.  A nurse earning Â£25,000 annually who opted out for a year could save Â£1,420 by doing so. But it would cost a lump sum of around Â£13,000 - roughly nine times the Â£1,420 saving - to fill the pension hole caused by that one year of lost pension in retirement, Royal London said.  When people opt out they also give up large employer contributions into their pension pot.  Sir Steve Webb, a former pensions minister who is now director of policy at Royal London, said: ""The NHS as an employer needs to take urgent action to tackle this epidemic of pension opt-outs.  ""All public sector workers have faced a squeeze on their takehome pay in recent years, but it is in the NHS where this has translated into shockingly high numbers of people leaving the pension scheme.""",1
What Doesn't Affect Your Credit Score,"A high credit score can be like a healthy weight. You know you want it, but are you doing the right things to achieve it?

Some information you thought might influence your credit score simply doesn't. Let's look at five things you don't need to worry will hurt your score "" and five things that do make a difference.
These factors don't affect your credit score  Your job and how much money you make: Your credit score comes from the information in your credit reports, which list your credit accounts and your payment history. Those reports do include some employer information, but it's used only to make sure account data is matched to the right person, says Rod Griffin, director of public education for credit bureau Experian.  Don't look for a bump in your score just because you get a new job with a great salary.  Â» MORE: Learn how to get and read your credit reports  Your bank balances: Credit reports list only credit accounts and how you paid them, not savings, checking or investment accounts. Your resulting credit score depends largely on whether you paid creditors on time and not at all on whether you're sitting on a pile of money.  Debit cards and prepaid cards "" even if they have a credit card logo: These cards work like credit cards at the register, but no one extended you a line of credit. You're essentially your own creditor because you're either paying as you go from a bank account or prepaying to load the card.  No line of credit equals no effect on credit score.  Your spouse's track record with credit: Studies show people prefer to date people with good credit, but marrying someone whose credit reputation has been a little shaky won't tarnish yours. Every person's credit reports "" and therefore credit scores "" are separate and individual. However, opening joint credit accounts or co-signing a loan with your spouse could affect your report.  Late fees: This is a tricky one. A late payment can't be reported on your credit reports until you're at least 30 days past due. Until then, you'll just face a late fee from your lender or credit card issuer. As long as you get that payment in before the 30-day mark, you avoid a delinquent mark on your reports and the score damage that follows.  So what does affect your score?  Here are the five key factors that make up credit scores. Knowing these will help you achieve a healthy credit score:  Payment history: This is the single biggest influence on scores, so paying on time is key to a great score.  Credit utilization: The second-biggest factor affecting your score is how much of your available credit you use. It's best to keep your balance on any credit card below 30% of your limit "" and lower is better.  Length of credit history: The longer your track record, the better, so don't close old accounts unless you have a good reason, like avoiding an annual fee.  Mix of accounts: Having both credit cards and installment loans helps.  Inquiries on your credit: When you try to open new credit accounts, each application can cause a small, temporary drop in your score. Checking your own credit has no effect on your score.

Cynical Abbey makes grand exit fee  ,"Abbey""s recent efforts to shake off its unfortunate nickname amongst long-standing critics of the mortgage bank are welcome. But there""s not much point in an expensive rebranding "" from staid Abbey National, to colourful Abbey "" if ""Shabby"" then reverts to the same old tricks.  

The bank""s decision to raise exit fees on its mortgages to Â£225 "" its second increase in four years "" is a cynical one. Abbey has launched some really good-value short-term mortgage deals in recent months, but if borrowers have to pay a fee to move elsewhere once the best rates expire, a large chunk of that value is eroded.  
Lenders are within their rights to charge penalties if borrowers jump ship during the first few years of their mortgages, when they""re on a special deal "" such as a fixed or discounted variable rate "" for example. But once these deals expire, borrowers generally move on to their lenders"" standard variable rates, which are almost always expensive. To penalise people who then decide to take their business elsewhere is totally unfair.    Not that Abbey is the only lender to behave this way, though it is just about the most expensive on this issue. Market analyst Moneyfacts says more than 50 lenders have raised their exit charges during the past year. They include Alliance & Leicester, Cheltenham & Gloucester and Royal Bank of Scotland.    There""s some rank dishonesty going on here. At first sight, the market for mortgages has never been more competitive. But beneath the surface, many lenders are making desperate efforts to claw back what they""re losing on cheap interest rates through higher fees and charges.    Abbey""s penalty is particularly pernicious. If you stay loyal to the lender beyond the term of a special offer, you will pay through the nose on the bank""s standard variable rate. This is currently 6.75 per cent, around 2 percentage points more expensive than the cheapest deals available "" the equivalent of Â£120 extra each month on a typical Â£100,000 mortgage.    If, on the other hand, you don""t want to put up with subsidising low- cost deals for Abbey""s new customers, you must now pay it a fee of Â£225 to take your business elsewhere.    This is a straightforward disincentive to remortgagging: this fee is simply designed to put people off seeking a cheaper deal from one of Abbey""s rivals.    To add insult to injury, many borrowers will now find that Abbey""s exit fees "" and the charges at the other 50 lenders who have raised penalties "" are now higher than what was set out in their original contracts when they first borrowed the money.    Aren""t lenders going back on their word?    ppp Well done Which?. It has won its battle with Fifa over the unfair ticketing arrangements for next summer""s World Cup in Germany. Until now, Fifa has insisted fans buy tickets on plastic issued by sponsor Mastercard, or via a German bank account.

And those with Visa-issued cards would be barred from the free credit-card service.

Texas Receives $10 billion Annual Economic Benefit from Public Employee Pensions,"New Delhi, Sept. 13 -- The economic and financial analysis firm The Perryman Group (TPG) is releasing a study identifying $10 billion annual economic stimulus created by payments sent to Texans from the state's large public retirement systems and the local pensions which are members of the Texas Association of Public Employee Retirement Systems, an organization representing more than 80 such organizations across the state.

""Our study confirmed that, in 2010, the large state and local plans paid more than $10 billion in retirement income to hundreds of thousands of retirees,"" said Dr. Ray Perryman, an economist and founder/president of The Perryman Group. ""More than 95% of these funds are sent to Texas residents and considering multiplier effects create $24.16 billion total expenditures and $11.12 billion in output.
""To put this number in perspective, $10 billion is about five times the total payroll in Texas agriculture, approximately equal to the total combined payroll of computer and electronics manufacturing in the state, and about the same as the total military payroll within Texas,"" Perryman said. ""The retirement payments produce $1.1 billion in tax revenues for the state and $438 million for local government entities.""  TEXPERS Board president Eyna Canales-Zarate delivered the report at a House Committee hearing today charged with examining the costs of local public employee pensions.  ""We share the House Committee's concern about monitoring ongoing costs but we must also balance those concerns with an understanding of the considerable benefits delivered to the Texas economy,"" Canales-Zarate said. ""Costs are already effectively managed at the city level through checks and balances by Boards of Trustees elected by their members and appointed by city leaders. We encourage continued local management of costs and benefits.""  Images, graphs or charts, if any, have been removed",1
A Look at Which Managers Back Their Funds,"SOME MUTUAL-FUND MANAGERS have more than $1 million of their own money invested in the funds they run, but others don't eat their own cooking, newly required disclosure documents show.

So far, it isn't clear whether having the chef at your table makes the food any better. An initial sampling of manager-ownership disclosures doesn't show a consistent correlation between the stakes fund managers hold and fund performance. The first reports were filed in March and many more remain to be filed.
When the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the disclosures last summer, it said ""a portfolio manager's ownership in a fund provides a direct indication of his or her alignment with the interests of shareholders in that fund."" Many financial advisers seek out funds whose managers have big personal stakes, arguing that such holdings give managers an extra incentive to do well for investors.  At the largest fund companies, managers with more than $1 million invested include Stephen Petersen of Fidelity Equity-Income Fund, an average performer in Morningstar Inc.'s ""large value"" category over the past five years, and Edward Bousa and Paul Kaplan, co-managers of Vanguard Wellington Fund, in the top 5% of ""moderate allocation"" funds over the five years. The SEC rule requires funds to disclose manager stakes by ranges, not exact dollars, with $1 million-plus as the highest bracket.  Meanwhile, regulatory filings for Vanguard Group's stock index funds and tax-managed index funds show five of seven managers having no money in the funds in those groups that they oversee. Michael Buek, manager of Vanguard 500 Index Fund, the nation's largest stock fund, had between $10,001 and $50,000 in that fund.  Twelve of 27 managers of Fidelity Investments' industry-specific Select funds had no money in the Select funds they manage, according to a filing.  And at the smaller PBHG fund family, Michael Sutton had no money invested in any of the three PBHG funds he has managed since 2000. While two of Mr. Sutton's funds rank in the bottom 10th of Morningstar's ""large growth"" category over the past five years, there are funds that have performed poorly whose managers have big stakes. James Oelschlager at Oak Associates Ltd. has more than $1 million in each of five technology-heavy stock funds he manages or co-manages, two of which Lipper Inc. lists among the worst-performing stock funds of the past five years.  Some fund companies have long touted that their managers are big investors in the funds they oversee, but others suggest that the information about manager holdings isn't that valuable.  At Vanguard, which last year opposed the disclosure of managers' stakes, spokesman John Demming says tying managers' pay to fund performance, a common practice in the industry, ""is a better way to align the interests of the manager with the shareholders."" He says Vanguard encourages managers to invest in their funds, but doesn't require it. Mr. Buek, the Vanguard 500 Index fund manager, says through the spokesman that all his investable assets are at Vanguard.  Fidelity spokeswoman Anne Crowley says knowing a manager's stake in a fund may tell potential investors whether the fund makes sense for the manager's personal portfolio, but ""it doesn't tell them about whether this fund fits into their own portfolio."" Narrowly focused funds like the Select portfolios, in particular, don't make sense for everyone, she says.  Still, some fund firms and individual managers appear to have felt pressure to have sizable stakes to report. When Morningstar Inc. last month criticized Mr. Sutton, chief investment officer of Liberty Ridge Capital Inc., for not investing in the firm's PBHG funds that he runs, the firm responded with a statement that ""a number of the managers have significantly increased their personal investments"" since the year-end figures in the filing. A spokesman said the firm and Mr. Sutton wouldn't comment further.  At T. Rowe Price Group, where many managers have large stakes in their funds, holdout Stephen Boesel dropped his previous policy of not investing in the T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation Fund he runs, spokesman Steve Norwitz says. Mr. Boesel had avoided his own fund, a top performer in its Morningstar peer group, so ""there could never be any concern or question that any investment decision he made was in any way influenced by his personal interest,"" Mr. Norwitz says.  The manager made an investment, recently disclosed as between $500,001 and $1 million, after ""seeing the regulatory writing on the wall,"" the T. Rowe Price spokesman says.  It can be tricky for investors to find the new disclosures of manager ownership -- and, once found, to figure out what the numbers mean.  The ownership data is listed in the Statement of Additional Information, filed with the SEC and available to investors on request. Some fund firms also post the documents, which can run to more than 200 pages, on their Web sites. In the past, funds had to disclose ownership only by those managers who are also fund directors or owners of 5% or more of a fund share class.  A particular SAI may provide information on one fund a manager oversees, but not others. There also have been errors in some initial filings. Paul Wick, lead manager of Seligman Communications and Information Fund, says his reported stake in his fund -- $100,001 to $500,000 -- represents his retirement accounts but omits another $1.5 million in shares held through a brokerage account.  ---  NEW CEO: Amvescap PLC named Martin Flanagan, co-chief executive of rival mutual-fund giant Franklin Resources, as its new president and chief executive, effective Aug. 1. He will succeed Charles Brady, currently executive chairman, who will continue as chairman of the Atlanta-based company.  Mr. Flanagan has been co-chief executive at Franklin, the No. 4 U.S. fund company, since January 2004, with Greg Johnson. The San Mateo, Calif., firm said Mr. Johnson, son of Chairman Charles Johnson, would continue as president and CEO.

Provincial finance ministers at odds over possible CPP reform,"A growing number of provinces are calling for an enrichment of the Canada Pension Plan, but it appears doubtful the country's finance ministers will find consensus to proceed with CPP reforms.

Boosting CPP, federal transfers to the provinces, the possibility of a national securities regulator and skills training are some of the major themes on the agenda for the federal, provincial and territorial finance ministers.
A number of provinces are urging the federal government to modestly and gradually increase CPP contributions in the coming years to help Canadians better save for retirement. An enriched CPP would complement the new Pooled Registered Pension Plans - a private-sector pension option to boost retirement savings - that is endorsed by the Harper government.  The federal government and a handful of provinces are worried that increasing CPP contributions at the current time would slap an additional financial burden on employers during a fragile economy and threaten their ability to hire workers.  Federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty says he wants consensus from all provinces before boosting CPP contributions, even though the support of only two-thirds of the provinces representing two-thirds of the population is actually needed to proceed. But provinces like Ontario believe there's enough support for CPP reforms and that the federal government should introduce legislation to boost contributions to help Canadians save for their retirement.  ""I think it would be a mistake for a federal government to (stop it),"" Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan told reporters.  ""If it's the will of the provinces, based on the equations that are all agreed to in the act, I think that would be a mistake. I think it would be a mistake to essentially give every province a veto on any important matter - that's effectively what you're saying here.""",1
Strong sellers' housing market in 2015,"Buying a house at what used to be an average price in Buncombe County became increasingly difficult in 2015, and that's likely to continue at least through the next six months, experts say.

Selling a home at higher-than-average price, however, was a different story.
Housing markets in Asheville and Buncombe County set a bevy of records in 2015, putting home ownership out of reach for some while also offering huge rewards for people who bought years ago and are ready to sell now.  Local trends reflect those across the country, national experts say, where low inventory also is pushing up prices.  Particularly significant among regional records is the median Asheville home sale price, which leapt to $242,500, a 7.8 percent increase over the previous record of $225,000 attained in 2006 and last year, said Mike Figura, owner and broker of Community Lifestyle Mosaic Realty in Asheville.  The combination of that price increase with the number of homes sold in Asheville and Buncombe County demonstrates a weaker pace of activity is unlikely, Figura said.  A total of 1,389 Asheville homes sold last year, the most ever. In Buncombe County, the most sold since 2006 at 2,510.  ""The last time we saw (prices) that high, in 2007, they were rising after volume (sold) dropped off,"" Figura said. ""That's an indication of a slowdown. Now, we're seeing peaks in homes selling and home prices â€“ and they're continuing to rise.""  That means the current market is more demand-driven and the prices are ""more real"" than they were before the market crashed in 2007, Figura said. ""The fundamentals are different.""  Other statistics reveal the strength of the seller's market, said Don Davies, founder of Asheville-based Realsearch, a company that analyzes real-estate trends.  The average asking price for homes in Buncombe County, including Asheville, as of Jan. 5 was $539,641 â€“ the highest ever.  Also as of that date, 1,187 county homes were on the market â€“ the lowest since 2004, Davies said.  ""At one time, what was setting high (average) prices was that there were lots of homes over $1 million,"" he said. ""Now, the inventory is low and the demand is high. That's driven prices up and makes the average higher.""  With fewer houses priced between $230,000 and $280,000, only more expensive residences remain, Davies said â€“ another cause of a higher average price.  National attention on Asheville as a destination, as a desirable place to retire, as a region with four seasons, and as a beautiful location with a high quality of life all benefit the seller at the expense of the buyer, said Susan Duncan, owner and broker in charge at Exit Realty Vistas in Arden.  ""The (sellers') market is really booming; it's very hot right now,"" Duncan said.  This cuts two ways, Figura said.  ""I'm happy to see real-estate appreciation for those who invested at the right time,"" Figura said. ""This is their nest egg.""  At the same time, Figura said those hoping to reap a substantial return on a real estate investment by starting now ""are going to have a much harder time than those who started 15 years ago.""  Jonathan Stanley, 39, an IT director at a Hendersonville-based nonprofit organization, is among those homeowners set to benefit.  He and his wife own a 1,450-square-foot house on Dale Street in West Asheville that Stanley bought just over 13 years ago for $117,500.  ""I plan to list it at $225,000,"" said Stanley, who's currently renting that house to tenants and living in Mills River, Henderson County, with his wife, Tracy, and their daughter, 5, and 1-year-old son.  They are keeping their options open. The Stanleys might buy in Mills River or they might decide to build a new home, he said.  The target time for ""serious"" house-hunting is summer, Stanley said.  He hopes to clear about $75,000 in profit once commissions and other closing costs are paid to purchase a new home.  The Stanleys are searching for something in the $300,000 price range that's about 2,000 square feet, he said.  ""We're planning to have more children.""  But many in Asheville and Buncombe County looking to buy are challenged due to rapidly rising prices, low inventory and out-of-towners paying cash for what is available.  ""It's sad to see in our society that you can be a hardworking adult and not be able to afford decent housing,"" Figura said.  This is happening nationwide, too, said Jonathan Miller, the New York-based co-founder of Miller Samuel, a residential real estate appraisal company, and the commercial valuation firm Miller Cicero.  ""Low inventory is forcing housing prices to rise far faster than wage growth,"" Miller said.  ""Housing prices are above the prefinancial crisis high that was a product of zero lending standards,"" he said.  In the current cycle, prices are rising for the opposite reason.  ""Tight credit causes inventory to fall because sellers can't buy in the same numbers they did before,"" Miller said. ""This is not healthy or sustainable.""  At the local level, one result is that homeowners are able to sell high, but they're also going to have to buy high, said Duncan, the Exit Realty Vistas owner.  ""Even if people want to downsize, that's going to be a challenge,"" she said. ""Either way, they're going to take a hit.""

'Force staff to contribute to pensions',"The next generation of workers may need to be forced into pension saving if automatic enrolment into schemes fails to generate enough take-up, a think-tank suggested.

A report from the Social Market Foundation (SMF) looked at how savings policies may need to evolve over the next 20 years in order to deal with people living for longer and taking on more debt earlier in life.
It argued that compelling people to save into pensions may be the ""next logical step"" if the weakness of the economy and sluggish wage growth put people off trying to save for their later years.  The report said that future governments may have to consider stepping into people's finances more to help them manage their money, by forcing them to save into a pension, for example, and helping with loans through various ""pinch points"" in their lives such as dealing with childcare costs. The Government's landmark scheme to eventually automatically enrol 10 million people into workplace pensions started last month and the initiative is being phased in over a six-year period.  Workers are allowed to opt out of schemes after they have been enrolled, but the Government wants employers to re-enrol people who have opted out every three years, to try to persuade them to save.  Fears have been raised of a looming pension-saving crisis amid declining rates of participation in schemes in recent years. By 2020 half of the UK population will be aged 50 or over.  Dr Nigel Keohane, SMF deputy director and author of the report, titled Jam Tomorrow?, said the state will need to ""nudge, prod and regulate"" people into managing their personal income and wealth.  He said: ""That means considering policies like compulsory pensions saving, low-risk pension products and incomecontingent loans for childcare."" Steve Gay, director of life, savings and protection at the Association of British Insurers (ABI), said the report raised some ""interesting ideas"" about how to engage people in saving.  He said: ""Closing the UK's savings gap is one of the biggest challenges facing our society... ""We need to think of innovative ideas that will help people to save for the future. Auto-enrolment is the single biggest pension reform in the last 60 years and will bring over 10 million people into the savings habit.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said: ""We want to get as many people as we can saving for their retirement but we also recognise the need for people to choose.""  50 The majority of the UK population will be over this age by 2020",1
Nationwide Financial Finds Regulatory Responsibilities Top Retirement Plan Concerns for Professional Service Firms,"
COLUMBUS, Ohio--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 20, 2012-- 

Eighty-four percent of professional service firms, such as law offices, medical practices and consulting agencies, say compliance with regulations is their top concern when sponsoring retirement plans for their employees, according to research from Nationwide Financial Services, Inc.
The research also shows that 28 percent of firms with fewer than 50 employees do not feel that their fiduciary requirements are being met. Additionally, 28 percent of plan sponsors were unable to show a complete understanding of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  Based on the research, firms also say that before hiring a financial advisor, they need them to be experts on regulatory and legislative issues. To help advisors stay up-to-date, Nationwide Financial created the ERISA and Regulatory Online Resource, an online resource for advisors.  ""Professional service firms present a real growth opportunity for financial advisors,"" said Anne Arvia, senior vice president of Retirement Plans for Nationwide Financial. ""What this research shows is that financial advisors can clearly demonstrate their value to these firms by working to address their concerns about compliance.""  The study compares employee benefit packages and the retirement planning needs of small businesses to those of professional service firms. The study also looks at anticipated changes to employee benefits, how benefit decisions are made, and how professional service firms select and work with financial intermediaries.  While ensuring plans are in compliance with regulations was the most important service advisors can provide for all small businesses, other services were ranked differently based on firm size and tenure. For example, firms with fewer than 50 employees ranked ""timely resolution of operational issues"" as the second most important service they expect to be provided, while larger firms placed more value on the ""selection and monitoring of investment options.""  Firms that have been in business for more than 50 years ranked ""investment selection and monitoring"" as the second most important service to support their plan, while businesses less than 10 years old cited ""providing participant advice"" as their second priority, behind keeping the plan in compliance.  Overall, 69 percent of professional services firms expect an annual or quarterly plan review, and 67 percent expect educational materials to be available for their participants.  Nationwide launches Added Value program  The survey was conducted to help Nationwide Financial gain insights about small businesses and professional service firms, and to develop tools for financial advisors to better support the unique needs of these businesses through its new Added Value program.  The Added Value program will provide financial advisors with information about key markets, along with guidance and tools to help financial advisors win and retain plan sponsor clients. Resources in the Added Value program include presentations on how to improve prospecting and retention efforts, and an educational overview of social media.  Also included in the Added Value materials are ways financial advisors can enhance their value proposition based on a professional service firm's type, size and tenure.  ""Financial advisors are looking for plan providers that can offer more than just a list of products. The Added Value program gives advisors an edge in helping address professional service firms' needs and concerns,"" said Arvia.  Arvia noted that the professional service firms research is just the first phase of our Added Value program.  ""In the future, Nationwide will conduct similar studies so that we can continue to provide financial advisors with the tools they need to help grow and retain long-term client relationships,"" said Arvia.  For more information about the research and the Added Value program, please watch this short video featuring Anne Arvia. Financial advisors can obtain more information about the program at www.nationwide.com.  Survey Methodology  In 2011, Nationwide Financial commissioned a third-party research firm to conduct a study titled ""Employee Benefit Trends."" The study compared the employee benefit preferences of professional service firms with those of other firms. Over 500 firms participated in the survey. Qualified respondents were primary decision makers for employee benefits at their firms and served in management roles. Firms surveyed were for-profit businesses offering defined contribution plans and had 5 to 500 employees.

Fresh grief for home buyers,"Your Money

FIRST-TIME buyers are set to be the main victims of the ongoing credit crunch as a host of new obstacles push property further out of their reach.
Figures released this week by the British Bankers' Association show the number of newcomers entering the housing market has fallen dramatically â€” and the outlook is bleak.  While a slowdown in the market has halted runaway house prices, many other factors will make the property market even more difficult for first-timers.  This week the UK's largest lender, Nationwide, announced borrowers must now find a 25 per cent deposit, compared with the 10 per cent previously required, to qualify for its best mortgage rates.  ""Many lenders are concerned about borrowers overstretching themselves and not being able to pay them back, "" said Sean Gardner, chief executive of MoneyExpert. com. ""In the past six months more than 500,000 homeowners missed a mortgage payment. Nationwide's move means a first-time buyer will need about Â£55,000 in savings if they want to buy the average house â€” before you take into account stamp duty, which now averages more than Â£2,000."" The withdrawal of 100 per centplus mortgages will come as a blow to many newcomers hoping to bag a home without having to save a deposit.  Home loans exceeding the value of the property were popular with those who struggled to save a deposit and stamp duty while renting. However, in the past few weeks the six lenders offering mortgages worth more than the value of the property have pulled out of that market. Although highrisk, they were useful for some professionals who could expect to earn a decent salary in coming years, such as trainee lawyers.  Melanie Bien, director at independent mortgage broker Savills Private Finance, said: ""Lenders are chasing profit rather than market share and are getting increasingly fussy about who they lend to.  ""Royal Bank of Scotland will stop offering 100 per cent mortgages from the end of this week, while others have cut their maximum loans from 95 to 90 per cent loan to value."" For those without a deposit, mortgages are not getting cheaper in line with a drop in the Bank of England base rate. ""Despite two rate cuts in recent months, rates on new mortgages have not fallen by as much as you would expect, "" Bien said. ""The link between base rate and mortgage rates has frayed, with the liquidity squeeze taking precedence."" Meanwhile, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has made fresh calls for an increase in stamp duty thresholds in next month's Budget.  What it means Problems for new buyers .Lenders are asking for bigger deposits .Loans worth as much as the property are being scrapped .Mortgages are not getting cheaper in line with the fall in the Bank of England base rate ",1
Cash point,"The true cost of the new pension freedoms is that thousands of people are missing out on thousands of pounds worth of income. In the six months since the changes kicked in, 60% of those who bought an annuity (lifetime income) from savings didn't compare the market, and simply accepted the income from the pension firm they had saved with.

From an average annuity of Â£53,300, the best standard yearly income is Â£3,083. The lowest is Â£2,824 - that's Â£214 a year less or Â£4,280 over a 20-year retirement.
The freedoms are meant to prevent people from getting a duff deal on their hard-earned cash. Instead, they have led to confusion and inertia. Most people can boost incomes by 10% by simply shopping around, while those with health and lifestyle factors can get even more.  Andrew Tully, of Retirement Advantage, said: ""Despite measures to try and encourage better practice, the situation is getting worse, and the market is failing consumers.""",1

Social Security in 2018: Potential changes and how they could impact you
The Senior Citizens League says that seniors on Social Security can expect an increase in cost of living adjustments not seen since 2012 as a result of inflation, according to this article on Fox Business. â€œThe rate of inflation is the driver of COLA increases. But the truth is that it would not take much to beat COLAs of the past five years â€” 2013 thru 2017,"" says an analyst with the advocacy group. ""During that time COLAs ranged from a low of zero in 2016, and 0.3% this year, to a 'high' of 1.7 percent in 2013 and 2015, anything above 1.7 percent would make it the highest since 2012. The bar is set pretty low.â€  How to use your RMD to create a tax-free inheritance for your heirs  Seventy-year-old retirees who have to take required minimum distributions from their tax-deferred retirement accounts will be better off using the after-tax money to buy a guaranteed universal life insurance policy than putting the cash in a regular savings account, according to this article on Kiplinger. For example, a retired couple with $431,520 savings in an IRA would end up with more than $1.5 million in retirement savings at age 85 if they buy the policy.  Ask Larry: Can my wife get a spousal benefit?  A 63-year-old wife qualifies for a Social Security spousal benefit on her husband's record if he is already collecting his own retirement benefit, according to this article on Forbes. If she applies, her spousal benefit will be reduced and she will be deemed to have applied for her own retirement benefit, which means she will only get the bigger benefit. However, if the couple is grandfathered by the new law, the wife can collect just her spousal benefit and defer her own retirement benefit.  How to switch careers and still reach your retirement goals  A study by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College has found that seniors who changed jobs in their 50s are more likely to continue working at age 65 than those who didn't, according to this article on CNBC. Workers who decide to switch careers experience a drop in wage income that can limit their ability to build their nest egg. ""I actually recommend career switchers not to worry about the short-term lack of retirement savings. The more important thing is the long-term career trajectory,"" says a certified financial planner.  The retirement question you need to answer  A brief from the Society of Actuaries provides a series of crucial questions that clients should answer as they plan for retirement, according to this article on CBS Moneywatch. ""Advertisements frame retirement as an extended vacation, brimming with fulfillment of life-long passions and dreams. But for many people, retirement is more like driving on a long trip with question marks posted in places where road signs would help,"" the brief states.",1
University staff stage five-day strike in pay and pensions dispute,"The University and College Union members are taking their third round of walkouts this academic year.

Staff at 11 Scottish universities will walk out in five consecutive days of strike action this week in a dispute over pensions and pay and conditions.
It is the third round of strike action of the academic year by members of the University and College Union (UCU), following 10 days of walkouts between February 14 and March 2 and three-day action in December.  The union said Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) pension cuts â€œforced throughâ€ by university employers will see 35% slashed from a typical memberâ€™s guaranteed retirement income, and it is demanding employers revoke the cuts and re-enter negotiations.  In the pay and working conditions dispute, the union is asking for a Â£2,500 pay rise for all university employees as it estimates wages have fallen by more than a quarter (25.5%) in real terms since 2009.  The money is there to pay staff properly, tackle punishing working conditions and reverse pension cuts that will devastate retirement incomes  Jo Grady, UCU  UCU general secretary Jo Grady said: â€œVice-chancellors and principals across the UK have the power to end these disputes. The money is there to pay staff properly, tackle punishing working conditions and reverse pension cuts that will devastate retirement incomes.  â€œInstead, university bosses are choosing to sit on reserves worth tens of billions of pounds and make their own staff suffer. Thatâ€™s why we are out on picket lines yet again.  â€œBy continuing to ignore the longstanding and serious concerns of staff, principals are not only pushing their own workforce to breaking point, but also doing serious harm to the future of higher education and preventing it from being the best it can be.â€  In the pay and working conditions dispute, the union is also demanding an end to race, gender and disability pay injustice, a framework to eliminate zero-hours and other insecure contracts, and meaningful action to tackle unmanageable workloads.  Those walking out on Monday are members at the universities of Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Stirling, Strathclyde and Edinburgh Napier University, Glasgow School of Art, Heriot-Watt University, the Open University and Queen Margaret University.  Members at the Open University are also taking two extra days of strike action because the teaching model is different to a standard university week, with the bulk of tutorials taking place during the weekend.  UCU members there will also be on strike on Saturday March 26 and Sunday March 27.  Members at some institutions are taking action only on the pensions issue, some only over the pay and working conditions dispute, and some on both.  A USS spokesman said: â€œWe understand the concerns of USS members, but the fundamental truth is that the price of promising a set, inflation-protected income for life in retirement â€“ paid no matter what happens to the economy or the higher education sector in future â€“ is much more expensive today than in the past.  â€œThe decisions made by the joint negotiating committee respond to the challenges presented by long-term economic and demographic trends by slowing the pace at which USS pension promises build up in future.  â€œUSS remains one of the relatively few private DB (defined benefit) pension schemes in the country still open to new members and still offering valuable â€˜guaranteedâ€™ benefits to its members.â€  A Universities UK spokesperson, on behalf of USS Employers, said: â€œTaking university staff out on strike again will not remove the need to reform USS to ensure it remains affordable for members and employers.  â€œThe package of reforms proposed by employers has now passed the joint negotiating committee and the USS Trustee Board, and will be implemented from 1st April 2022.  â€œFebruaryâ€™s industrial action did not achieve the outcome UCU intended, and data gathered by Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) suggests turnout on picket lines was even lower than before, with limited disruption to students.  â€œWith news of more strikes and yet another ballot, reasonable onlookers will conclude the union has an ideological fixation with strike action and is determined to pursue it, no matter the cost. Since 2019, an average member of staff earning Â£55,000 per annum taking strike action has forgone over Â£4,800 in pay deductions, to no avail.  â€œScheme members should ask themselves whether they are willing to sacrifice even more to pay higher pensions contributions based on UCUâ€™s unsubstantiated view that another valuation will yield a better outcome.  â€œEmployers have repeatedly made clear that current contributions are at the very limit of affordability, and a majority of those responding to a consultation on UCUâ€™s proposal for higher contributions rejected it. Recent government announcements underline the wider financial uncertainty universities are facing, and with the 2020 valuation now concluded, it is time to look forward and identify lasting improvements to USS that can be made ahead of the next valuation.â€",1

Converting a 401(k) into a Roth IRA  ,"Q. I am 74 and would like to convert all or part of my 401(k) to a Roth IRA. How is that done?  

A.  
It's a two-step process. First, the 401(k) would be rolled over into a traditional IRA. Then that IRA would be converted to a Roth.    Any brokerage or mutual fund company can provide the forms for rolling the 401(k) into an IRA and then converting the IRA to a Roth. So long as the money is moved directly from the 401(k) to the IRA â€” without stopping in an ordinary bank account along the way, for instance â€” there won't be any tax charged, as 401(k)s and traditional IRAs are treated the same for tax purposes.    For the Roth, all the money you convert will be subject to income tax. That's the tax normally paid on withdrawals from 401(k)s and traditional IRAs. It is charged on conversions because once your money is in a Roth, both the original sum and future investment gains will be tax-free.    There are a number of things to consider:    Shifting from a 401(k) to a traditional IRA can make sense even if you don't take the next step to the Roth, as IRAs offer more investment choices.    Roth investors are never required to make withdrawals, while investors with 401(k)s and traditional IRAs have to begin minimum annual withdrawals after turning 70Â½. This is important if you want the money to compound longer, or if you'd like to leave the account to heirs, who would get a Roth free of any income tax. (A Roth can be subject to estate tax if your estate is larger than $2 million.)    If you switched to a Roth, you'd have to leave your money to grow in the account for some time to make the move pay. The benefit comes from the tax-free growth that starts once the money is in the Roth.    Generally, a Roth conversion makes sense if you expect your income tax rate to be higher in the future, since paying tax on today's conversion saves you the higher tax you'd have made later on the 401(k) or traditional IRA.    To be sure of benefiting from a Roth conversion, all of the money originally in the 401(k) should go into the Roth. In other words, don't take money from the 401(k) to pay the tax due on conversion. The tax should be paid from other funds.    Since you are in your mid-70s, the clearest benefit of moving from a 401(k) to a Roth is the ability to pass future investment gains to heirs tax-free.    But even that benefit is not certain if you are in a high tax bracket and your heirs are in a low one. The net sum left to your heirs might be higher if they paid a small tax on a 401(k) rather than having you pay a large tax on a conversion.    Try playing with a Roth-conversion calculator, such as the one at  www.calctools  .com/RothConversion.htm.    Q.    My 21-year-old son has repeatedly been denied a credit card because he does not have a credit history. What should he do?    A.    The simplest solution is for your son to get a secured credit card. Unlike the common unsecured card, the secured card requires the holder to deposit money with the issuer before using the card â€” typically $300 to $500, but sometimes less. The cardholder then has a credit limit equal to the amount on deposit.    After making on-time card payments for a year, he should be able to get a regular credit card.    Search for secured cards at  www.bankrate.com , and watch out for high fees.    Contact Jeff Brown at brownj@phillynews.com.  ",1
"Balancing retirement savings, paying for college","Most people want to help their children pay for a quality college education, but it can be difficult to balance personal financial goals and funding your kids' educational aspirations. When retirement savings is sacrificed for college costs, it can be a disservice to the entire family.

To help guide you in determining the best way to pay for your kids' college while still funding your retirement savings, personal finance expert and host of the So Money podcast Farnoosh Torabi offers several smart tips.
Don't put retirement on the back burner.  While funding your children's college education is important, your retirement savings should take priority. Strive to contribute 10 to 15 percent of your take-home pay toward retirement savings. The reality is college is four years and retirement can be 30+ years. Plus, there's no scholarship for retirement like there is for college!  Take the free money.  If your workplace retirement plan comes with a match, take it. Contribute the minimum to receive your employer match. At the end of the day, it's free money and that's the best kind.  Involve your children in the college cost discussion.  College is expensive, so make sure you're discussing with your kids overall costs and what you're willing to contribute. Have them help research financial aid and scholarship opportunities, too. Remember, you want to find a school that's the best fit - so don't let the initial ""sticker price"" scare your children from applying. Some private colleges may give the best aid packages, but other times they may not. Don't make assumptions and always keep your options open. The goal is to find the college with the best value.  Don't take on more than you can afford.  While involving your children in the discussion, it's also important to make sure you're not setting them up for failure when they graduate. As they research student loan possibilities, make sure they'll be able to comfortably afford payments once they graduate, and that they're not taking on too much debt.  An easy way to start researching together is to visit College Ave Student Loans and use the configure-it-out tool. Answer a short series of questions regarding how much you'll borrow, how many years of schooling are left, whether you want to make payments during school or not, etc. This shows your child what repayment will look like under each option so you can both be clear on the details and agree on a game plan.  Consider the college savings plan that's best for you.  Consider opening a 529 that allows flexible spending toward higher education. Should your child choose to forgo traditional college education or not require the funds set aside, you can easily change the beneficiary to another child or relative.  If you're skeptical of a 529, consider a Roth IRA if your income limits allow. Although typically used for retirement, the Roth IRA has an exception where you can withdraw your contributions from the account at any time tax- and penalty-free for qualified education expenses. The remaining money can be collected in your retirement.  Starting late? Play catch-up.  If saving for retirement has not been a priority, it's time to get aggressive. Pare down costs where possible and take advantage of catch-up contributions. People who are 50 or older can contribute an extra $6,000 to their 401(k) or an extra $1,000 to an IRA this tax year.  Don't become the ""bank of Mom and Dad.""  You want to help your kids, but once you set the precedent that it's OK for your children to ask for money (or a contribution toward college), they may feel they can frequently approach you later in life for funds. Don't set the tone that you'll always be there to financially support them. You want them to grow wings so they can fly independently (and so you can happily enter retirement and enjoy those golden years).  While you should talk with your child about potential majors and career paths, it's important also to add financial conversations into the mix.

READ MORE: State pension to rise just Â£4.25 a week â€“ three ways YOU could get thousands more  It turned out homesitting was the perfect solution for them. It has allowed them to travel, explore new places and spend time in the countryside.  Julie said: â€œWe do a lot of homesits around the Cotswolds near where we live. Even if weâ€™re only going thirty miles or so from home, it is often to somewhere we havenâ€™t heard of before!  â€œThereâ€™s a limited amount of exploring you can do while youâ€™re working and weâ€™re really enjoying discovering new places.â€  Peter and Julie have been able to earn just over Â£180 as a couple for a two-week homesit, and they also get reimbursed for mileage at 45p per mile.

Now Granny is hit by the child benefit claims confusion,"Janet Tutton is one of thousands of women born in the 1950s who missed out financially because of the way the pension system was reformed.

Not only was she affected because of how the state pension age was equalised for men and women, she was also caught out by the sudden increase in the number of years of national insurance contributions needed to get a full state pension.
Janet also learnt that she had gaps in her national insurance record because she had opted out of the state second pension, meaning that she didnâ€™t have the 35 years of credits needed to get a full state pension.  Janet, 66, looked for ways of recouping her credits and discovered that she could earn them through looking after her grandchildren Isaac, six, and Georgie, four, which she had already been doing for years.  You can apply for â€œspecified adult childcare creditsâ€ if you are a family member caring for a child under the age of 12. It means that parents can donate the national insurance credits they would get from registering child benefit to a family member.  However, when she started filling in the application form to claim additional national insurance credits, she realised that another complicated system stood in her way: child benefit. She was not able to get the credits because the childrenâ€™s parents had not registered to receive the benefit. Her daughter Nicola, 40, did not qualify for it because she is classed as a high earner. Like many parents, Nicola did not fill in the child benefit form because, under rules introduced in 2013, she was not eligible for any money.  â€œSheâ€™s a very busy person in a high-pressure job, itâ€™s just a lot of effort to get nothing back,â€ Janet says.  Parents can claim Â£1,788 in child benefits each year for two children, but they have to start paying some of this back through tax if one of them earns more than Â£50,000 a year. If one of them earns Â£60,000 a year they get nothing. Two parents each earning Â£49,999, with a household income of almost Â£100,000, can get full benefits.  Janetâ€™s case is another example of how families are being affected by the confusion around the child-benefit system. This is why  The Times  and  The Sunday Times  are calling for reform in the forthcoming budget.  â€œOnce upon a time, when everyone received child benefit regardless of income, this link between child-benefit and national-insurance entitlements made sense, but the current system is no longer fit for purpose, â€ Becky Oâ€™Connor of the adviser and asset manager Royal London says.  HMRC says: â€œWe use a wide array of channels to reach those customers who may be liable to pay the high-income child-benefit charge. This includes putting information in packs made available to new parents which tell them how to claim child benefit.â€",1
Savings and retirement options for Baby Boomers,"Starting this month, the first wave of baby boomers will be turning 65 and signing up for Medicare. Some of their generation are opting to take their Social Security benefits at age 62. And many more would like to continue working but can't find a decent job because unemployment is still above 9 percent.

Unfortunately, many boomers are not financially prepared to stop working because they don't have enough savings set aside for a comfortable retirement. Although procrastination and poor saving habits play a major role, other factors also come into play.
The traditional pension plans that their parents' generation took for granted are mostly a thing of the past. They have been largely replaced by 401(k) plans which put the responsibility for saving directly on the employees.  And, through no fault of the workers' themselves, the financial meltdown on Wall Street adversely affected the balances in most retirement accounts. On top of that, many boomers banked on their homes as part of their retirement funds, but the economic crisis reduced the typical home's value by almost a third.  Still, their greatest shortcoming has been a failure to save. And it seems that younger workers are at risk of falling into that same pattern. Half of eligible young employees do not participate in a 401(k) savings plan and when they do, they don't save much. Also, younger workers are more likely to liquidate their accounts when they leave for a different job.  The solution is simple. Everyone needs to take an honest look at the state of their finances and begin making whatever changes are necessary to start creating a secure financial future for them selves. Saving more is critical, especially since workers are, and most likely will continue to be, more reliant on personal retirement savings than those of past generations.  If you aren't contributing to your 401(k) retirement plan at work, visit your human resources department today to sign up. You'll never regret that decision.",1
Claim student moving expenses: Keep September receipts for use in April tax returns  ,"At this time of year, tens of thousands of kids are on the move, either returning to post-secondary schools or attending school for the first time. In some cases, they are not necessarily travelling from home but have had summer jobs in other places. The starting point (that is, where the student leaves from) and the finishing point (where the school is, makes no difference so long as at least one of them is in Canada.  

The main limitation in respect of claiming moving expenses by a student is that the expenses are limited in that they can only be set off against the taxable amounts of scholarships, bursaries or research grants. One odd result of the 2006 Budget, which made scholarship money non-taxable, is that it effectively removed one source of income against which moving expenses could be claimed ... a small price to pay for a big tax break.  
But if the student also holds down a job, a common phenomenon, moving expenses can be set off against employment or business income generated at the locale where the job is. The only limitation here is that the travel in question must have been at least 40 kilometres.    Consider the following case. Joshua was attending school in Toronto, but got a very well paid job planting trees in British Columbia for the summer. As the employer did not pay for the trip to B.C., the costs associated with travelling there were deductible against the income earned. This, of course, involves the basic moving expense claim available to anybody.    But when he moved back to Toronto, the costs associated with that move were also deductible, because he did have income from a part-time job in Toronto. He could use the moving expenses against that income as well. In practical terms, a combination of the deductions plus the tuition tax credits meant that he had no tax liability and was able to transfer $5,000 of tuition tax credits to his long-suffering father, who paid for a fair percentage of his education.    In order to make the claim, the student must be in ""full-time attendance"" at a ""university, college or other educational institution."" There are often serious questions raised about both what is meant by ""full-time attendance"" and whether certain schools meet the statutory definition. The best source of non-technical information is found in Interpretation Bulletin IT-178R3.    Under subsection 62(3) of the Income Tax Act, eligible moving expenses include any expense incurred as, or on account of:    - Travelling costs, including meals, lodging and vehicle expenses, in the course of moving the taxpayer and members of the household.    - Transportation and storage costs for household effects (including items such as boats and trailers).    - Costs for up to 15 days of meals and temporary accommodation near either residence.    There are many other expenses which can be claimed in respect of moves, but few of these would be applicable to a student. Others who can claim moving expenses should check the Interpretation Bulletin.    One of the reasons it is important to alert children about the moving-expense deduction now is because the claim will normally be made some time in April. While receipts need not be submitted with the claim (which involves filing a T1-M form), it is necessary to retain receipts for possible verification. It is not enough for the student to make a rough and ready estimate after the fact and hope for the best.    - Arthur Drache, CM, QC, is an Ottawa-based lawyer with Drache LLP and is associate counsel to Miller Thomson LLP.    adrache@drache.com  ",1
FINANCIAL FOCUS; How does Social Security fit into your retirement income strategy?,"It might not be on your calendar, but Aug. 14 is Social Security Day. Since it was enacted on Aug. 14, 1935, Social Security has provided some financial support for millions of Americans during their retirement years. While Social Security benefits, by themselves, probably aren't enough to enable you to retire comfortably, they can be a key part of your overall retirement income strategy - if you use them wisely.

To help you make decisions about Social Security, you will need to answer these questions:
When should I start taking my benefits? You can take Social Security once you reach 62, but if you wait until your full retirement age, which will probably be between 66 and 67, you'll get much bigger monthly checks, and if you wait until 70, you'll get the biggest possible payments. Before deciding when to begin receiving your benefits, you'll need to weigh a few factors, including your estimated longevity and your other sources of income.  How should I consider potential spousal benefits? If you are married, or if you're divorced but were married for at least 10 years, you could receive up to half of your spouse's full retirement benefit (offset by your own benefit, and reduced if you claim early). If you outlive your spouse, you could claim survivor benefits, which can provide either your own benefits or 100% of your deceased spouse's, whichever is larger. Consequently, the higher-earning spouse might want to postpone taking benefits for as long as possible to maximize the survivor benefit.  How much can I earn without reducing my Social Security benefits? If you are younger than your full retirement age and you are receiving Social Security, the Social Security Administration will withhold $1 from your benefits for each $2 you earn over a certain threshold (which, in 2019, is $17,640). For the year you reach your full retirement age, your benefits could be withheld by $1 for every $3 you earn over $46,920. But once you reach your full retirement age, you can earn as much as you want without your benefits being withheld, although your benefits could still be taxed, depending on your income.  How much of my pre-retirement income will Social Security replace? Generally speaking, you should expect Social Security to replace slightly more than a third of your pre-retirement income. However, the higher your income during your working years, the lower the replacement value of Social Security will be.  What other sources of retirement income should I develop?Contribute as much as you can afford to your IRA and your 401(k) or similar employer-sponsored retirement plan. You may want to consult with a financial professional, who can look at your entire retirement income picture and recommend moves to help you achieve the lifestyle you've envisioned for your later years.  Keep in mind that your decisions about Social Security filing strategies should always be based on your specific needs and health considerations. For more information, visit the Social Security Administration website at socialsecurity.gov.  One final word: You may have concerns about the stability of Social Security. While no one can predict the future, many potential solutions exist to put the program on more solid footing. Consequently, try to focus on the actions you can control.

Pitfalls in interest-free,"QUESTION: 24 months interest-free seems too good to be true. Is it?

ANSWER: If you play strictly by the rules, interest-free deals offered by large stores can be a good way to buy what you need, but can't afford at the time. Apart from a monthly administration fee of a few dollars, try to pay instalments each month of at least one 24th of the total amount, to completely pay out the loan within the interest-free period. If not, you'll incur interest on the balance of up to 28 per cent! If you lose your job and get stuck with that high interest, it could send you broke.
QUESTION: I'm paying the minimum amount each month on my 36-month interest-free purchase of furniture, which cost $5500. Is this enough to avoid interest?  ANSWER: No, the minimum amount each month is not nearly enough to pay off the purchase price in time. When the interest-free period is up, you'll be expected to pay a lot -- the full balance of the loan.  QUESTION: I went to buy a chandelier, which was advertised at a discount of 15 per cent, on my credit card. At the cash register, I changed my mind and asked to buy it on their interest-free offer. The store told me the discount wasn't available if I bought on an interest-free loan. Can they do that?  ANSWER: The store should point out that exclusion in their advertisements, otherwise it's misleading for customers. It shows how the costs can be built in to interest-free deals. Not a fair practice. I'd report them to Fair Trading.  QUESTION: I'm having a dispute about an outstanding amount on my interest-free purchase, which I thought I'd paid out. As the months go by, that originally small amount is blowing out, but they still refuse to drop the charge.  ANSWER: At 27 per cent interest, it's easy to see how even a tiny amount can multiply to a huge sum over time. Write immediately asking for an official explanation of the charges, and request to have them dropped. You could elect to pay the amount they claim is owing and take the matter to Fair Trading for resolution. It pays to read the fine print of interest-free contracts.",1
Troubleshooter,"Pension problems

I am approaching 60 and have a pension pot of about Â£125,000 in a defined contribution scheme from my time with an organisation called Home Group. The scheme is administered by Friends Life.
I was told by Friends Life in June last year that, as a result of the government's pensions reforms, from this April I would be able to take all of the pot out as cash without having to buy an annuity. But on two subsequent occasions, the most recent this month, I was told that it cannot confirm this as ""we are waiting for details from the government"" and that I ""should phone back in March when we hope things will be clearer"".  Given that these reforms are supposed to take effect in less than three months' time, I find it frustrating that I cannot obtain any definitive answers on which to base critical financial decisions.  LEN DAVIES, VIA EMAIL  From April, anyone aged over 55 should be able to do what they like with their pension pot. But the ""freedom and choice"" pension reforms could leave 5.9 million people at risk of poor decisions, the National Association of Pension Funds (NAPF) warned this week. ""There is very little time until freedoms start but there's still a great deal of uncertainty about what people should do to make best use of the new pension reforms,"" says Graham Vidler, of the NAPF. It doesn't help if people such as Len can't get basic answers to their questions from their pension provider.  Another reader, Paul Harrison from Nottingham, says he phoned Scottish Widows in January to inquire about taking advantage of the new pension rules. He says: ""I was amazed to be told that Scottish Widows had no systems or procedure to register my inquiry. I then said I would like to draw down my pension over a period of time to avoid 40 per cent tax but Scottish Widows stated I would have to draw the whole pension or leave it where it is.""  Both Friends Life and Scottish Widows were apologetic but argued that they have systems in place. A spokesman for Friends Life says: ""We are sorry to hear that Mr Davies did not receive the support he required. We are now arranging for a retirement specialist to call him to discuss his questions. We have a dedicated team of people who can provide customers with information and answer questions about the new options available to people approaching retirement. However, we are unable to action an instruction from a customer wanting to take advantage of the pension freedoms until they come into force on April 6. We also suggest customers seek independent financial advice in order to make informed decisions about their retirement income needs.""  A Scottish Widows spokesman says: ""We are very sorry that the incorrect information was provided to Mr Harrison and have contacted him to ensure his request is dealt with properly. Scottish Widows can take instructions now which will be processed as soon as the legislation becomes effective. We have also been contacting customers nearing retirement since October last year to help make sure they understand the changes.""  Elderly targets  My 98-year-old mother, who has dementia, was not using her landline phone so I removed it from her in July 2014. The bill from her provider, TalkTalk, was then Â£26.59, so I rang up to pay this and terminate the contract but got nowhere. I wrote a letter on July 10 asking to cancel Mother's phone line and stressing that I would not be paying anything above the amount due. Since then I have written four more times, the last being on November 27. There has not been a meaningful response to any of my letters. TalkTalk even asked her for her password, which is a Joke as she cannot possibly remember it.  Meanwhile Mother's account continues to accrue charges â€” it is now at Â£162.39.  PAUL TILZEY, NORTH CORNWALL  On this page we today report the story of an 81-year-old woman with dementia who had hundreds of pounds stolen via a cold call on her landline phone. Courier fraud is a crime so despicable that perpetrators who are caught by the police beg to have the fact that they fleeced elderly people kept a secret from other jailed prisoners, reports the Hampstead & Highgate Express newspaper in London.  Landline companies can help to prevent crime against those with dementia. Ofcom has encouraged telephone providers to cut the time a phone line remains open after someone hangs up to just a couple of seconds. This stops fraudsters staying on the line to impersonate a victim's bank or the police, the key to making a caller sound convincing. It would also help if phone companies terminated contracts promptly when the children of those with dementia ask them to. TalkTalk says it made a mistake in failing to act on Paul's request and has apologised, waived the charges and deactivated his mother's phone line.",1

The ABC's of baby boomer
retirement planning  If you are one of America's 78.2 million baby boomers, you are likely considering what ideal retirement will look like and the steps required to achieve it. With the current economic downturn, many boomers are finding it necessary to revisit their initial retirement goals. Consider the following ABC's of retirement planning:  A: Assess your financial plan and budget. How much will you need to retire? Determine this by creating a budget that will enable you to pay your monthly expenses such as food, heat, rent and transportation. Consider expenses that may increase, such as health insurance and prescription medicines.  B: Begin to explore other retirement income options. Decide when to begin Social Security benefits. According to AARP, for each year you put off collecting your benefits between ages 62 and 70, you increase your payments by 8 percent.  C: Consider life insurance - the foundation of a solid retirement plan. Consult an expert in order to find the right life insurance for you.  - ARA  BBB Watch  The Better Business Bureau is warning consumers about online programs that offer fast and easy high school diplomas or college degrees.

City - City - Letter to Your Money - Seeing red over missing premium Jessica Investigates.
","
MORE than two months ago I drew a cheque for #622.36 on my bank account in settlement of a premium due on a Norwich Union policy. I paid this into my bank using the bank credit transfer form attached to the foot of the premium demand. I assumed this would ensure a transfer. The premium was receipted and the cheque debited to my account the same day.



Some time later, I received a red premium demand from Norwich Union and learnt the premium had not been received.

 JW, Grouville, Jersey    NORWICH Union categorically denied receiving the money so everything seemed to point to the bank being to blame.    However, my contact at the bank ascertained that the insurer had had the money all along. Even at this stage, some two-and-a-half months after it had in fact received the money, Norwich Union failed to find the missing funds.    After further researches, the money has at last turned up in a ""suspense account"", which temporarily holds money before it is allocated to its proper destination. Clerical error is blamed for all this.    Norwich Union is paying #25 as an ex gratia sum. Its efforts to have six bottles of wine sent to you have also been dogged by ill fortune but they will be with you in time for Christmas. ",1
financial planning; Retirement contributions â€” what you need to know,"The IRS recently announced 2015 contribution limits for various retirement plans. These limits are indexed for inflation, but some plans will not increase their contribution limits from 2014, as you will see in the examples below. Here is a summary of those new limits and some tips for maximizing your retirement savings:

The IRS recently announced 2015 contribution limits for various retirement plans. These limits are indexed for inflation, but some plans will not increase their contribution limits from 2014, as you will see in the examples below. Here is a summary of those new limits and some tips for maximizing your retirement savings:
401(k), 403(b), 457 plans  For 401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans, the contribution limit for 2014 is $17,500 with a catch up contribution of $5,500 for those that are age 50 and older. For 2015, the new contribution limits are $18,000 and $6,000 for the catch up contribution, for a total of $24,000, a $1,000 total increase. For those that have both a 457 plan and either a 401(k) or 403(b) â€“ you have the potential to double your total contributions. In other words, you can contribute $36,000 or as much as $48,000 if 50 or older in 2015.  SIMPLE  The contribution limits change slightly for those that participate in a SIMPLE (Savings Incentive Match PLan for Employee), $12,500 in 2014, with a $2,500 catch up contribution. For 2015, those contributions increased by $500, so $13,000 and $3,000 catch up.  IRA  No change for 2015 for both Traditional and Roth IRA contribution limits. Both remain at $5,500 contribution limits with the catch up contribution staying put at $1,000 ($6,500 total). We'll touch on contribution rules for both Traditional and Roth IRAs as far as how they apply to income limits and those participating in a 401(k) or 403(b) later in this article.  SEP IRA & Solo 401(k)  These business owner plans have increased their contribution limits for 2015. For SEP IRA, the maximum contribution increases from $52,000 (2014), to $53,000 in 2015. There is a formula that will calculate how much you can contribute so check with a tax professional for specific contribution information related to your business income.  For Solo 401(k) plans, the increase is from $52,000 to $53,000 for 2015. You can contribute an additional $6,000 in catch up contributions, $59,000 total for 2015, this includes profit sharing plan contributions in addition to your contribution as a participant.  Contributing to an IRA and company retirement plan  If you work, or your spouse works, your deduction for contributing to your IRA could be affected depending on whether you or your spouse has a retirement plan at work.  First off, whether you are single or married, if you and your spouse has a retirement plan then you can make a contribution to an IRA that's fully deductible.  On the other hand, if you are married and have a retirement plan, you will be allowed to fully deduct your IRA contribution if your modified AGI is $96k or less in 2014 ($98k in 2015), and no deduction for those with income above $116k ($118k-2015). For single individuals, that modified AGI is $60k or less for 2014 ($61k-2015) for a full deduction, and no deduction for income above $70k ($71k-2015).  If your spouse is covered, but you are not, then those income limits differ. For the one not covered by a retirement plan, $181k ($183k-2015) is the 2014 income limit for those allowed a full deduction, with no deduction of income $191k or more ($193k-2015).  I'll be the first one to admit this can be confusing. For more information, go to IRS.gov or talk to a tax professional or financial adviser.  Contributing to a Roth IRA and a Retirement plan  For those who wish to contribute to a Roth IRA, there is some flexibility if you are participating in your company retirement plan. You are able to contribute to both as long as you are below a certain income amount. For single individuals that have a Modified AGI of less than $114,000 ($116,000 for 2015) are able to contribute to a Roth IRA. With married individuals, that modified AGI number is $181,000 ($183k for 2015).  *Note: Modified Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) is adjusted gross income subtracted by certain items such as student loan interest, qualified tuition expenses, one half of self-employment tax, and more. For a complete description, I encourage you to visit www.IRS.gov.  Summary  It's important to take advantage of these contribution limits and make sure you are updating your contribution amounts to reflect the increased contribution limits for the new year. In addition, there is still time to make modifications to your retirement savings this year. Now is great time to make sure you are maximizing your contributions and uncovering all of your options when it comes to saving for retirement.",1
"Mum had drugs, utensils in family home","A NEWTOWN mother of three has taken a hit to the household budget by way of a hefty fine after she was found with cannabis, smoking utensils and a syringe during a police search.

Rebecca Ellen Beazley had become agitated when police arrived at her Newtown home with a search warrant on June 11, Toowoomba Magistrates Court heard.
When it appeared she was about to move something in the kitchen, a policeman stood in her path and she had taken a swing at him, which missed, police prosecutor Bettina Trenear told the court.  The police search turned up a total 17.4g of cannabis found in various clip seal bags and a bowl in the kitchen and lounge room, a homemade bong and two other pipes for smoking the drug, and scissors and an electric grinder used for chopping up cannabis leaf, the court heard.

RETAIL WOES Coronavirus Scotland: Topshop closes all stores leaving furious employees worried about pay,"https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/topic/coronavirus/ TOPSHOP has shut all its stores indefinitely, because of the spread of coronavirus.

The store has said that all staff remain employed, but has only guaranteed pay until the end of March.
Read our coronavirus live blog  for the latest news & updates  The Arcadia group, which owns Topshop, said it was planning to close all stores from 4pm yesterday.  As well as 300 Topshop locations, the group is also shutting all Burton, Dorothy Perkins, Evans, Miss Selfridge and Wallis shops.  Furious employees of the group say that the announcement came less than an hour before chancellor Rishi Sunak announced wide-ranging measures to protect employees.  They say Topshop has promised to pay them for March, but that the company is unable to confirm whether employees will be paid after that.  A statement sent to employees read: â€œIn line with many other retailers, the Group has made the difficult decision to close until further notice all of our stores from 4pm this afternoon. All store staff remain employees during this time and will be paid their normal pay for March plus any outstanding overtime payments, after which we will review this situation and will be keeping our store teams updated.â€  Coronavirus Scotland: New Look offers workers voluntary unpaid leave   Employees and customers have responded angrily to the news, especially the lack of clarity over future pay.  Rece tweeted: â€œI work for Topshop. my manager said we have this monthâ€™s wages then theyâ€™re not paying anything.  â€œIâ€™m 18 and work weekends, I donâ€™t know if the government will pay me the 80 per cent wage which I need for my disabled mother.â€  Lauryn added: â€œJust showed up to start my shift at Topshop to hear everyone in the business has been â€œlaid offâ€ till further notice and stores closed.  â€œFull pay at the end of this month and no pay further promised. Theyâ€™re â€œreviewing what can be doneâ€. Pathetic.â€  And Lucy said: â€œI was just temporarily laid off from Topshop, so still on payroll, just not earning.  â€œHowever I canâ€™t see them actively applying to the scheme.â€  Chancellor Rishi Sunak yesterday revealed that the government would pay up to 80 per cent of wages â€“ or up to Â£2,500 a month â€“ for people who are not working but kept on payroll.  It is not yet clear whether Arcadia Group employees will benefit from this scheme.  The Sun has asked Arcadia for a comment and will update this story when we know more.  Ikea is set to close all 22 UK stores due to coronavirus, but customers can still shop online.  Meanwhile, easyJet staff have been asked to take three months unpaid leave due to coronavirus.  And TK Maxx has shut all of its 349 stores as the virus continues to spread throughout the UK.  We pay for your stories and videos! Do you have a story or video for The Scottish Sun?

"Where thereâ€™s a will, thereâ€™s a way","Do you have a will? It takes less time for most people than watching an episode of your favourite series on Netflix. And you donâ€™t need to be rich to need a will. Often having KiwiSaver is a good enough reason to have this document that says who you want your money and other belongings to go to when you die.

Itâ€™s Wills Week from September 7-11. So you might want to delay watching just one episode and make sure youâ€™re no longer one of the 48 per cent of all Kiwi adults who donâ€™t have a valid will.
The usual excuse for not having a will is you think you have no money, or youâ€™re too young. But who will inherit your KiwiSaver? What about your pets? Or any family heirlooms you own.  Covid-19 has made some people feel a sense of urgency to write will for the very first time. But more often than not those are middle-aged or older people who have reflected on their mortality, not younger ones, says Angela Vale, chief executive of online will-making service Footprint.co.nz.  By the time youâ€™re in your 20s you may well have more to your name than you think. The average KiwiSaver fund is around $17,000, points out Public Trust chief executive Glenys Talivai. You may also have life insurance through work, or your estate could get a lump sum from travel insurance if you die while away.  A simple will is fine if you donâ€™t have too many complications, such as trusts, second marriages, blended families, or cutting someone out who might expect to benefit. In that case, says Jennifer Tweed, Perpetual Guardianâ€™s national manager retail you may need a complete estate-planning review covering wills, trusts, and powers of attorney.  Although itâ€™s a rare occurrence, wills can be challenged in the courts, says Talivai. Itâ€™s one reason why trusts have been popular, although some are now choosing to wind them up because of increased compliance requirements in the New Zealand Trusts Act 2019, which will come into force in January.  One of the best reasons to get a will is because if you donâ€™t the rules of â€œintestacyâ€ kick in when you die and the law dictates who gets what. If a young mother or father dies, for example, they might have some of their money distributed to their own parents, not partner and children. If that parent has remarried, your money could then pass to the spouseâ€™s children.  Vale saw a relative left struggling to make ends meet after a spouse died without a will, meaning his money didnâ€™t automatically pass to her. â€œShe should have been fine after her husband died. (Instead) she was left on the bones of her bum having to borrow money.â€  Itâ€™s not just money. Talivai has seen a case where the fatherâ€™s beloved guitar was fought over. In another one a daughter wanted her motherâ€™s special quilt, which wasnâ€™t noted in the will. It could easily have been disposed of.  The good news is that wills can cost as little as $100 and be completed online through Footprint, Public Trust, or other services. They usually have legal support so that someone with an eye for what can go wrong reviews your will, and escalates it if there is an issue.  Footprint, which works with Perpetual Guardian, offers both one-off wills, and also a service where you pay an annual fee, but includes up to $10,000 of estate administration when you die.  Life does take twists and turns, says Tweed, so do remember to update your will when your situation changes. That might be having children, hooking up with a new partner, buying a house or taking out life insurance.  Do have a conversation with your family/beneficiaries. If you donâ€™t plan to share your money equally, let your loved ones know, so there is less chance of a bunfight when youâ€™re gone. Make sure you explain the rationale and keep records of your communication.",1
"Student loan debt plays major role in homeownership gap, studies show","The homeownership gap between white and Black homeowners is about the same as it was in 1968 â€” the year the Fair Housing Act went into effect.

According to the National Association of Realtors, the homeownership rate among Black Americans is 42%, and the homeownership rate among Latinos is 47%.
Researchers say there's a variety of systemic challenges that make it difficult for people of color to own a home, including student loan debt.  More Black and Latino students have been enrolling in college since 2000. But according to the National Center for Education Statistics, Black students are more likely to take on student loan debt, have higher levels of debt after graduation and have lower incomes than their white peers.  That means that Black graduates end up paying off their student loans at a slower pace.  ""Unfortunately, they do not start off on the same playing field,"" said Jessica Lautz of the National Association of Realtors. ""We know that minority students are more likely to take on student loan debt because they have less access to, perhaps, scholarships or family help in the college admission process.""  Loan debt doesn't just affect the ability to purchase a home. Researchers say even when people of color are able to buy a house, they tend to be 11% less expensive than the homes of white buyers.  ""Even among successful home buyers, if they enter homeownership and they're saddled with student loan debt, they're purchasing a home that is significantly less than another buyer, and that's really going to cut into the affordability of homes, and it's the lack of affordability that buyers are facing,"" Lautz said.  Less expensive homes eventually affect a homeowner's wealth gains over time.  Loan debt also impacted other life choices of people of color, like whether or not to continue going to school, start a family or get married. The report found that Hispanic and Black borrowers were more likely to put off those milestones and decisions.  Report a typo",1
Tax-deferred accounts get (temporary) boost from CARES Act,"You need to primarily rely on yourself to protect your health during the coronavirus. But from a financial standpoint, you may have gotten some relief â€“ or at least some flexibility from the recently passed $2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.

Retirement account holders, including owners of IRAs and 401(k)s are usually required to start taking distributions from these accounts once they reach age 72. The CARES Act waives these required minimum distributions (RMDs) for all employer plans and IRAs in 2020, with the exception of defined benefit plans. If you've already taken your distribution for 2020, you can put the funds back in your retirement account if you meet certain requirements.
Of course, if you needed â€“ or will need â€“ the money from the RMD for your cash flow needs, you won't have to return it. But if you don't really need the money, avoiding an RMD in 2020 or returning an RMD to your retirement account will give the funds more time to grow on a tax-deferred basis before the RMDs are once again required in 2021.  Another CARES Act provision allows for the 10% early withdrawal penalty to be waived for withdrawals up to $100,000 from qualified retirement accounts, including IRAs and 401(k)s, for individuals who qualify for COVID-19 relief. Qualifying individuals include those who are diagnosed with COVID-19, have a spouse or dependent who is diagnosed with COVID-19 or experience adverse financial consequences as a result of COVID-19, including quarantines, layoffs, business closures or child care responsibilities. Income tax on the distribution would still be owed but could be paid over a three-year period. Employer plan participants also may increase the amount that can be taken as a loan from a qualified retirement plan from $50,000 to $100,000 for 2020. While the CARES Act allows these penalty-free withdrawals and increased plan loan amounts, you will need to contact your plan administrator to determine whether these options are available in your plan.  Even though you may be able to access these funds penalty-free, it doesn't necessarily mean you should do so. Try to exhaust some of the other provisions in the CARES Act first, such as the mortgage or student loan relief, or using the direct payment to bridge the gap on current expenses before taking a distribution or loan from your retirement account. If you decide to take a withdrawal or loan, work with your financial advisor to consider developing strategies to contribute/pay back these funds over time to reduce any long-term impact to your retirement goals.  Please consult with your tax professional before making any CARES Act-related moves with your retirement accounts. Partnering with your tax and financial professionals can help in the decision-making process. In the meantime, stay safe, stay healthy and keep looking forward to brighter days ahead.

Minimize Tax Burdens In Retirement,"MoneyTips
For those approaching retirement, it is important to pay attention to the rules in order to reduce tax costs. Paying tax on the limited funds available to many retirees can be frustrating, so understanding the system is crucial.It is vital to realize that withdrawals from retirement savings are taxable. For example, a $30,000 withdrawal from a 401(k) with a 15 percent tax rate will result in a payment of approximately $4,500 to the IRS. The same applies to pension plans and some annuities. Understanding tax rules is essential for budgeting and planning retirement income.One good tip is to maximize any medical deductions. Although medical costs can take up a large amount of income, they are also tax-deductible. By itemizing costs, you can claim a medical expense deduction, as long as your out-of-pocket expenses reach 10 percent of your adjusted gross income (AGI).It is wise to move taxable stock investments into bonds before retirement. This can achieve a steady stream of federal tax-free interest income. Also, by buying municipal bonds from a home state, local and state taxes can be avoided. Mortgage interest can also be deducted from taxable income, so homeowners still paying their loans should take advantage of this.Retirees often downsize, which can be a good time to donate items to charity. As well as making the move easier, the value of the goods can be deducted from taxes, helping to maximize retirement income.Let the free MoneyTips Retirement Planner help you calculate when you can retire without jeopardizing your lifestyle.

Universal Credit shake-up will affect 500 people from Monday -what you need to know,"Old-style legacy benefits are being phased out, with the â€œmigrationâ€ process of switching people over to Universal Credit restarting on Monday, May 9. Only around 500 people will be invited to move over at first

The so-called â€œmigrationâ€ process of moving legacy benefit claimants to Universal Credit will restart next week, in a move that will ultimately affect millions of Brits.
There are around 2.6million people still claiming old-style benefits in the UK.  This includes tax credits, income-based Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance JSA, Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance ESA and Housing Benefit.  These benefits are eventually being phased out, with the â€œmigrationâ€ process of switching people over to Universal Credit restarting on Monday, May 9.  This process had been temporarily paused during the Covid pandemic.  Only around 500 people will be invited to move over at first, but the Department for Work and Pensions DWP will increase the numbers of people it processes over the next few months.  Everyone will eventually be moved from the older welfare system to Universal Credit by December 2024.  Anyone who applies for new benefits right now gets Universal Credit automatically.  When it is your turn to be moved over to the new system, you will receive a â€œmigration noticeâ€ in the post which will give you a three-month deadline to claim Universal Credit.  Have you been told you are moving to Universal Credit Let us know: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  If you don't start a claim for Universal Credit within this time, your current benefits will automatically stop after this deadline.  Some people may be moved across to Universal Credit early if they see a change in circumstances -for example, if they move home or change their working hours.  As we've mentioned above, everyone will be migrated over eventually -but you can also choose to transfer over sooner if you think you'd be better off.  Not everyone will get more money on Universal Credit. The DWP claims 1.4million legacy claimants 55% are set to be better off under the new system, and 900,000 35% would be worse off.  The other 300,000 benefit claimants will see no change.  We've got a guide here on how to check if you'll be better off on Universal Credit.  Once you make a Universal Credit claim, your old benefits will be stopped -you will then have to wait five weeks for your first Universal Credit payment to arrive.  Some legacy benefits will ""run on"" for two weeks to help bridge some of that gap.  This includes Housing Benefit, Income Support, income-related Employment and Support Allowance and income-based Jobseeker's Allowance.  With both types of tax credits, payments will stop as soon as you claim Universal Credit.  Which benefits are being replaced  Universal Credit is replacing the following six benefits:  * Working Tax Credit  * Child Tax Credit  * income-based Jobseekerâ€™s Allowance JSA  * Income Support  * income-related Employment and Support Allowance ESA  * Housing Benefit  Most of those being moved over to Universal Credit are on ESA 1.2million or Tax Credits 1million.  200,000 are on Income Support and 100,000 on each of Housing Benefit and JSA.",1
How Immigrants Can Plan a Comfortable Retirement,"Planning a comfortable retirement can be a complex process. That's especially true for immigrants, who often face legal hurdles that people born in America don't.

For one, immigrants might not know which retirement benefits they qualify for, says financial planner Steve Branton. But getting an overview of the basics is a solid first step.
We asked Branton to highlight some of the most important things immigrants should know about retirement planning and discuss some of the challenges they might face.  What is the main challenge immigrants face when planning for retirement?  Whether U.S. citizen, resident alien or nonresident alien, the biggest challenge is understanding how your immigration status affects your U.S.-based retirement income sources. That includes Social Security benefits and pensions, as well as other retirement accounts, such as individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s. Additionally, your immigration status affects how your income is taxed.  Â» MORE: Sending money abroad? Use NerdWallet's transfer rates tool to compare costs  Can immigrants contribute to and collect Social Security?  Resident aliens, including permanent residents, can contribute to Social Security while working in the U.S., and are generally eligible to receive Social Security.  Nonresident aliens, meanwhile, can pay into Social Security, but their benefits typically terminate if they leave the U.S. for six months or longer. Returning to the U.S. for at least one month should reactivate the benefits.  What are some other common retirement challenges immigrants might face?  There are a handful of issues immigrants planning to retire in the U.S. might run into. Estate planning is more complicated, due to the differences between how property is handled at death for domestic assets and foreign-owned assets.  Compliance reporting is another tricky area, as all foreign-owned accounts exceeding a certain dollar amount must be reported for tax purposes for both U.S. citizens and residents. What's more, U.S. citizens and residents must report worldwide income, though foreign-earned exclusions and tax credits apply.  Transferring retirement accounts into (or out of) the U.S. is a very complicated process, and may not even be advisable. With a few exceptions, you would be required to essentially liquidate your U.S. retirement account and pay taxes as well as any applicable penalties before being able to transfer the funds to an account in another country. Normally, most retirees prefer to stretch out distributions from their retirement accounts.  Because the same might apply for incoming retirement assets, it may be better to keep retirement accounts in the source country while familiarizing yourself with the rules and tax-related issues for withdrawing that money during retirement.  To make the process easier on yourself, consider working with a knowledgeable cross-border financial planner. He or she should have a firm grasp of both the legal and tax differences between your home country and the U.S., which can take some of the burden off of your shoulders as you prepare for retirement.

Oklahoma awarded $1.8 million for HIV programs,"Oklahoma awarded $1.8 million for HIV programs

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded more than $1.8 million to expand access to HIV care, treatment, medication and prevention services in Oklahoma.
The awards will be used to identify at-risk individuals in Oklahoma and engage in prevention services, test for HIV, and prescribe pre-exposure prophylaxis where appropriate. Awards will be used to link people with HIV who are either newly diagnosed, or diagnosed but currently not in care, to essential HIV care, treatment, and support services, helping them reach viral suppression and reduce HIV transmission.  The agency awarded more than $1 million to four health centers in Oklahoma with service delivery sites in geographic locations identified by a federal initiative aimed at significantly reducing HIV infections.  The federal agency awarded $750,000 to one Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program recipient in Oklahoma to link people with HIV who are either newly diagnosed, or are diagnosed but currently not in care, to essential HIV care and treatment and support services, as well as to provide workforce training and technical assistance.  Oklahoma is among seven states identified with a substantial rural HIV burden.  Fees drop for state's college saving plan  Effective this month, the management fee for Oklahomaâ€™s 529 College Savings Plan is being reduced by more than 16%. The new management fee will be 0.25% on account balances, down from 0.3%. The fee reduction could save account owners a combined total of about $500,000 per year.  State Treasurer Randy McDaniel, chair of the planâ€™s board of trustees, said the fee reduction is only one of many positive changes that are on the way for the planâ€™s almost 31,000 account owners.  â€œThe stateâ€™s 529 plan is already the best option for Oklahoma families to save for educational costs, but we are making it even better,â€ said McDaniel. â€œIn the coming months, we will be announcing several additional improvements that include enhanced investment options and upgraded online account management.â€  The Oklahoma 529 College Savings Plan is the only direct-sold 529 plan with an Oklahoma income tax deduction for contributions of up to $20,000 per year. Contributions made by April 15 of this year can be deducted from 2019 state tax returns.  The plan has more than 57,000 active accounts.  Staff reports",1
There are no dumb questions about Social Security,"Dear Rusty:

I have some questions about Social Security, but I've never been old before so these may be dumb questions.
My 66th birthday is in October 2021; do I put in for Social Security in January 2022? Or when? I am a 30-year military retiree. Do I need to bring my DD-214 to the SSA Office when I apply? My wife has not held a job outside the home, but she has worked as hard if not harder than me running and taking care of our home and affairs when I was away a lot of the time. She turns 66 in September 2022. Can she apply for Social Security and, if so, does she get a percentage of what I get?  Thank you for any help you can give me.  Signed: Retired Military  Dear Retired Military:  There are no ""dumb questions,"" especially when it comes to Social Security which has over 2,700 different rules sure to perplex even the most learned among us. I'll answer your questions in the order you posed them:  Your full retirement age (or ""FRA"") is 66 years and 2 months. Your FRA is when you get 100% of the benefit you've earned from a lifetime of working. Claiming earlier will mean a reduced benefit; waiting longer can mean a larger benefit. If you wish to claim benefits at your full retirement age in December 2021, you should apply for those benefits in September 2021 (SS suggests you apply 3 months before you wish benefits to begin). Just be sure to specify your benefit start month as December to get your full benefit.  You do not need your DD-214 when you apply for Social Security. Your earnings during your military career are already known to Social Security and will, along with any non-military earnings, form the basis for your Social Security benefit. Your SS benefit will be based upon the highest-earning 35-years of your lifetime earnings career (adjusted for inflation). You do not need to go to the SS office to apply; you can apply over the phone (call to make an appointment first) or online at www.ssa.gov/retire. Applying online is by far the easiest way to claim your benefits.  Even though your wife is not eligible for SS benefits on her own work record, she can still collect a spousal benefit from you. If she waits until she reaches her FRA before she claims, she'll get 50% of the benefit you are entitled to at your full retirement age. Your wife's FRA is 66 years and 4 months and, although she can claim the spouse benefit before that, if she does it will be actuarially reduced according to the number of months before her FRA that she claims. FYI, your wife cannot collect her spousal benefit until you have started to collect your benefits.  Finally, thank you for your many years of service to our country. Your pay while serving will be part of the 35 highest-earning years over your lifetime used to compute your Social Security benefit.

Sean Talks Money: How to Give Your Child Excellent Credit,"My sister Megan called me recently asking for advice on picking a new credit card. Because she's a college student and only 19, I assumed she'd qualify only for a student or secured credit card, so I spent 10 minutes talking her ear off about those options before I bothered asking whether she knew what her credit score was.

Her answer? 778, well into the 'excellent credit' range many top-tier credit cards require. I was floored. My baby sister's credit score was only 20 points lower than my own, despite my having a regular job, bill pay history and quite a few credit accounts to my name.
After some digging, I learned that my parents had basically gifted her near-perfect credit by the time she graduated high school. Here's how they did it and how you can try to do the same for your kids.  How it happened  Looking at Megan's credit score dashboard at NerdWallet reveals some interesting stats:  * The oldest credit card on her report is older than she is, at 23 years and 7 months.  * The average age of her accounts is 7 years and 2 months. (Seven years ago, my sister was 12.)  * 12 open accounts.  * An unblemished payment history.  * Over $100,000 credit line.  * Four hard inquiries in the past year, which is above average, suggesting that her score could rise even further once the impact of those 'hard pulls' dissipates.  Â»MORE: Understand your credit score  Those stats aren't errors. They just reflect the potential power of 'authorized user' status.  My parents didn't have a master plan when they added Megan as an authorized user of their cards. They did so simply because giving her direct access to their cards was easier than giving her cash when she went on school trips, attended dance camps, or just stepped out for gas or groceries.  Fortunately for Megan, my parents have had many years of impeccable credit hygiene, and she automatically gained that same benefit as an authorized user of their cards. As a result, my sister has amazing credit, even though the longest-serving card she herself owns is just 1 year and 5 months old.  'The first time I found out my credit score was when I applied for an apartment and they requested my credit information,' Megan told me. 'I remember sitting at the desk in my dorm room, and once I found out, I immediately called my mom and then I ran around and told all of my roommates. Sadly they didn't share the excitement since they had no idea what a credit score was.'  Should you do this for your children?  This may sound odd, but you can add your children of any age as authorized users on your credit cards. Here are the caveats you should keep in mind:  * The authorized user approach makes sense only if you can add your children to a card in good standing, meaning you're paying the bills on time and keeping the balance low. Any mistakes you make on your card, such as missing a bill or charging a high percentage of your credit limit, would damage your children's credit score.  * If you're concerned about what your children might do with access to your credit line, then simply don't give them the actual cards. Add your children as authorized users and then "" when the mail comes "" shred the cards or bury them in your sock drawer. Your children will get the credit benefit regardless of whether their card is ever used; the credit bureaus don't know the difference.  * FICO and VantageScore, the two biggest credit scoring companies in the U.S., aren't enamored of the idea of credit piggybacking. They're working on newer versions of their credit-scoring algorithms to lessen the positive impact of being an authorized user, so your children may not benefit as much as my sister did. That said, lenders tend to be rather slow to adopt the newer credit scoring algorithms, so this may not have much real-world impact for a while.  * If you trust your children with access to your money, you'll also need to trust that they'll protect your credit card information. Make sure they know credit card security basics, like to use it only at reputable websites and businesses, and to never leave cards lying around in public sight.  My mom, Kristen, has some additional advice: 'Make sure your child understands the importance of credit and that it isn't free money. They can go and buy something on credit and it be pretty easy, but they have to understand that the charge has to be paid.'  If you have a card with solid payment history, consider adding your children as authorized users. It can help them build their credit and learn other financial skills that will serve them well when they're no longer under your roof.  Sean McQuay is a credit and banking expert at NerdWallet.

Ask Noel Boost super over paying down your mortgage,"I am aged 58 and my husband is 65. We both work full-time and salary sacrifice the maximum amount into superannuation. I earn $120,000 a year and my husband earns $113,000 a year. He has $470,000 in super and I have $450,000. We still have a mortgage of $367,000 on our family home, worth $1.6 million. My husband hopes to retire at age 70. Are we better off paying down the mortgage over the next five years, or making after-tax contributions to super?

It's great that you are planning now to make the best of your retirement years.
The interest rate on your mortgage should be no more than 3 per cent a year and I would hope that the returns on your super fund would be at least of 7 per cent per annum. Therefore, I think you are perfectly placed to maximise your non-concessional contributions to super. There is no entry tax on these contributions and they also would reduce the overall taxable component of your fund.  The concessional contributions you are making would be $21,250 a year each after allowing for the 15 per cent contributions tax.  If your funds earn 7 per cent, your husband's super should be worth about $780,000 when he retires at age 70. If you work to age 65, your super should be worth about $900,000. The non-concessional contributions would boost these numbers even more.  My wife and I retired two years ago and we both took our defined benefits as income streams at that time. We are self-funded, over our preservation ages, but under 60. Due to the pandemic, I started casual work as a contractor three days a week with my original employer. We have also moved closer to my ageing parents and sold our house. We are now looking at buying a new, more expensive property. I was planning to take a cash lump sum super payment from my secondary accumulation fund, separate to the defined benefit. Would the lump-sum withdrawal meet Australian Taxation Office rules, considering my casual work?  Based on the information provided, there may be an amount that could be withdrawn.  Your first task is to obtain the latest statement from your super fund that contains the accumulation balance to see if there is any amount unpreserved from the old rules. This is unlikely and you would probably find that all your funds became unpreserved when you retired.  However, your fund may require you to satisfy them that you did actually retire if you did not notify them at the time.  Any contributions and earnings after you recommenced work would, in your case, be preserved until you satisfy a condition of release. Until you turn 60, you have to retire to access those amounts. Your partner may be in a different position.  There is no simple answer - you need to contact your super fund to find out where you stand.  My wife and I are in our mid-50s and have about $500 a week each for investing. Neither of us has much super - we are both reluctant to pour money into it. Where could we invest our cash that would give us the best return over the next 10 years? Potential options include super, an investment property, a property trust, managed funds or blue-chip shares. Anything else?  There are two important factors to consider - the types of investments to hold and the best entities in which to hold them.  For a person in their mid-50s earning more than $37,000 a year, the perfect investment is super because you can usually invest in pre-tax dollars with salary sacrifice.  Because salary-sacrificed contributions lose just 15 per cent in tax and money taken in hand loses at least 39 per cent, you are making big tax savings immediately.  Once the money is inside super, you and your financial adviser can decide what sort of asset mix is appropriate for you. The cream on the cake is that fund earnings are taxed at just 15 per cent a year while you are working - and then zero tax once you retire and start a pension from the fund.  I am aged 65 and will be applying for my UK and Australian aged pensions on my next birthday in May. I left the UK at the age of 35 and have been advised I should receive Â£80 per week from a part-state pension. In addition, I receive a monthly pension of Â£438 for life from my former UK employer. I have only $200,000 in Australian super. Would I be required to pay Australian tax on my UK pensions?  The pension income would be taxable but you would get a credit for tax paid in the UK, as well as an 8 per cent deduction for return on capital. Also, thanks to the range of offsets available, you may find that zero tax would be payable on your overall income.

Homeowner advocate says ``never, never, give up hope,'' when faced
with foreclosure
","
ORANGE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Is there a solution to the agony
of losing your home?



Yes, according to Joe Vera, chief executive officer of California
Associates for Real Estate Strategies (CARES), a homeowner advocate
and foreclosure prevention specialist.

 CARES was established by Vera, to assist homeowners in various stages of default.  ``Most homeowners experience such overpowering and demoralizing emotions that in effect, they become paralyzed,'' Vera said.    Default and foreclosure statistics demonstrate CARES is on the cutting edge of an unfortunate, but realistic emerging trend in the state's homeowner status.    As examples, San Diego County had 11,912 notices of default for 1992, a 40 percent increase over 1990, when 8,005 notices of default were filed.  Sacramento County foreclosures went from $203 million in 1990 to a projected record-breaking jump of $1.1 billion for 1993.    Another critically affected area is Southern California's Inland Empire, comprising Riverside and San Bernardino counties, where there were 2,000 foreclosures per month in 1992 and are expected to reach 3,600 per month by the middle of this year.    Vera summarized some of the causes for this growing phenomenon. ``The tremendous loss in aerospace, finance, construction, retail and manufacturing industries; the North American Free Trade Act; military cutbacks; federal budget cuts; a difficult business environment and the fact that more people are leaving California, than are coming in, are just a few reasons for this trend,'' he said.    The financial status of the nation's lending institutions and Americans' inability to save were two more examples Vera cited as reasons for the default and foreclosure problems of the state's homeowners.  ``The fact that Americans have insignificant savings, are earning less, and are more in debt; not to mention the mismanagement of our banks and savings and loans,'' Vera added.    To combat this growing concern, CARES conducts educational seminars, known as The California Foreclosure Forum for real estate agents and free property owner seminars, called The California Foreclosure Prevention Forum.    ``Even though our banks are allowed creative accounting procedures, it is acknowledged that repossessing hundreds of homes could be devastating to the lending institution, if not a direct cause for their failure.  We have to understand that banks really do not want our homes.  The logical approach is to find alternate repayment structures for the homeowner,'' Vera stated.    The homeowner's seminar, The California Foreclosure Prevention Forum, educates property owners as to the alternatives, such as ``forbearance.''  This method allows homeowners to keep their homes by working out modified payment plans.    ``Unfortunately, in economically distressed times, many miracle cures are offered and are designed to take advantage of the desperate homeowner.  Our seminar attendees are shown how hard money loans work and what potential problems to look for from lenders offering such loans,'' he added.    Vera has nearly 20 years of experience in negotiating with lenders, trustees and attorneys, as well as local, state, and federal agencies and governments, through all phases of the process, which may or may not include the sale of property.    ``If the property owner has decided the best answer is to sell, he may try to do it himself.  Being a `FSBO' (For Sale By Owner) is risky business, even in good times.  Today's buyers are looking for bargains, the seller is stressed and escrows can be complicated.    ``The homeowner may decide to list the property with a professional real estate agent ... but who?  You know the foreclosure clock is ticking, you told your realtor, but unless he had special training and is knowledgeable in the foreclosure process, chances are the property owner's problem won't be solved in time, if foreclosure is to be avoided,'' Vera stated.    In addition to the free homeowner seminars, CARES also conducts a four-hour course for real estate brokers and agents throughout California.  This educational program provides agents the tools to assist their clients in those unfamiliar and critical circumstances.    During the agent seminars, the three most commonly used bankruptcy chapters are discussed as options.  Bankruptcy is a valid strategy that can help rehabilitate a property owner.  Vera said bankruptcy requirements and the long-term effects are included in the seminar presentation.    ``Here, competent legal assistance is very strongly encouraged,'' he said.  ``Bankruptcy mills are defined and their use is urgently discouraged,'' he commented.    Those who attend either the California Foreclosure Forum or the California Foreclosure Prevention Forum are shocked when they hear about little-known capital gains tax consequences of a foreclosure.    ``Generally speaking, even though the home is lost through foreclosure, the borrower still has a tax liability on an amount equal to the sum of all the loans against the property, delinquencies, late fees, attorneys fees, foreclosure trustee fees, less the cost basis of the original home whose gain was rolled over into the current property,'' Vera pointed out.    He summed up the homeowner seminar by indicating the solution is knowledge and action.  ``The homeowner must exhaust all his options toward his intent, to save or to sell,'' he said.    At the property owner seminar's conclusion, appointments for an individual consultation may also be scheduled.

PersonalFinance: Making sense of the housing market,"(Linda Stern is a freelance writer. Any opinions in the column are hers. You can follow Linda Stern's financial notes on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/lindastern)

By Linda Stern
WASHINGTON, Sept 22 (Reuters Life!) - Buying or selling a home might be the biggest single financial transaction of your life. You want to get it right but how do you do that at a time when even professionals don't fully understand what's going on in the housing market?  Is it a good time to buy a home or sell a home? Here are some thoughts about how to approach the housing market now.  -- Don't rush. Probably the one housing market observation that everyone agrees on is this: It's not going to take off in a hurry. Analysts expect it to be several years before home prices return to the levels they reached in 2005-2007. And they don't expect mortgage rates to skyrocket, either.  -- Research your own market. Some areas still seem to be in free fall, with high foreclosures and no real recovery in sight. Other areas that weren't so bubbly in the first place have been doing all right. Check with local real estate agents and Websites like trulia.com, (http://www.trulia.com) homegain.com (http://www.homegain.com) or the Standard & Poor's Case Shiller index (http://www.standardandpoors.com/indices/sp-case-shiller-home-price-indices/en/us/?indexId=SPUSA-CASHPIDFF--P-US----) to see what's actually happening in your chosen neighborhood.  -- Expect prices to fall further. There's a disconnect between what sellers think their homes are worth and what buyers are willing to pay, according to a new survey from HomeGain. Some 79 percent of homeowners believe their homes are worth more than the recommended agent listing price, and 69 percent of agents and brokers think homes are overpriced. If owners really want to sell their home, they'll drop the price to a level that will attract offers; it's rarely worth carrying a home for months or years while you wait for the price to get to your desired level. That means that homebuyers may find some better deals ahead.  -- Look for a retirement or vacation home now. If you've been thinking you'd like a second home now or a future home in the traditional retirement Sunbelt, go shopping. You'll be able to get a good deal. But beware: You may lack neighbors for years to come. That doesn't just mean you'll be lonely; it means you could be paying out-sized condo and clubhouse fees to compensate.  -- Plan a seasonal approach. If you need to sell now, price your house low enough to engage a buyer before snow falls. In cold-weather areas, winter is often a long and lackluster time for real estate. If you're buying, start looking now, but expect that by winter you may get even more for your money.  -- Keep it about your own budget. If you want to buy a home and can afford the payments, don't worry so much about the macro-economic forecast for housing.  -- Keep maintenance in mind. The recession has dampened the market for contractors and for energy commodities. Once the economic recovery strengthens, you can expect to pay a lot more for any repair work your home requires, and for your heating and cooling bills going forward. Look for the lot and the house that will fit your family, but keep an eye on those practical considerations, too.  (Editing by Gunna Dickson and Patricia Reaney)",1
From the Community; Social Security not retirement,"The enactment of the Social Security program in 1935 remains an important landmark in American history.

Although highly popular, Social Security was born in controversy and continues to exist among a variety of misunderstandings.
First, Social Security was never intended to be a broad program that entirely replaced wages and salaries in a manner that brought prosperity to all retirees at age 65.  The program was conceived as a means of providing a minimum standard of economic support, not a smooth continuation of pre-retirement income or pathway to previously unknown prosperity.  The key word is ""minimum. The primary goal is to keep older Americans from the depths of poverty.  Second, many of us forget that in 1935, when the retirement age was set at 65, U.S. life expectancy (at birth) was approximately age 61 (for men it was age 59.9).  A high percentage of the population was not expected to live long enough to see their first Social Security check.  Today, life expectancy is age 79 (at birth) and the expectation is that current retirees (age 67) will probably spend nearly 20 years in retirement.  Ironically, people are living longer and many are insisting on retiring earlier.  It is not surprising that Social Security has some funding issues.  Third, the program is intended as a supplement to other sources of income in retirement years.  Among the earlier recipients of benefits, Social Security provided an amount that approached 80 percent or so of one's total retirement income.  In subsequent years the percentage of income provided by Social Security programs is more in the range of 40 percent of income needed for a minimal to average standard of living for retirees.  Social Security is built on the foundation of assumed additional income derived from two other major sources: pension plans and from savings and investments.  The amount expected to be needed from savings and investments is on the ascendancy; meanwhile, the proportion expected to be contributed by Social Security alone is continuing to drop.  It is hardly surprising that many pre-retirees today have great concern about their economic well-being in retirement.  Far too many of us are failing to prepare for the needed income that goes well beyond the minimum support provided by Social Security per se.  One of the most concerning attributes of today's workers is that fewer and fewer of us have the option of defined benefit pension programs.  We are responsible for providing our own nest egg of savings and investments.  Far too many of us are falling short of having the appropriate types and levels of investments to get us through our retirement years.  Dennis Quillen (Ph.

FRANKLIN; Property tax bills to rise,"FRANKLIN â€” Property tax bills for the average homeowner would rise $118 after the Town Council set the rate at its set Dec. 8 session.

The council set the fiscal 2016 tax rate at $14.50 per $1,000 of assessed value.
The rate actually dropped from fiscal 2015's $14.84, but property values have increased, meaning most bills will increase.  Councilors also opted to retain the single tax rate for residential and commercial/industrial properties. Town Administrator Jeffrey Nutting said the town has historically had a single rate. Some communities have dual tax rates in which commercial and industrial properties are taxed differently, often higher, than homes.  Nutting noted that the average price of a single-family home in town had increased from $381,200 to $398,300. As a result, the average residential bill would climb from $5,657 to $5,775 - a 2.1 percent change. The average commercial tax bill would increase by $240, he said, though he noted there is a greater variance in the values of commercial properties.  Officials noted that the increase was lower than those of the past few years. According to town paperwork, the average single-family bill jumped $397 in fiscal year 2015, and $270 in fiscal year 2014.  Ken Norman, chairman of the Board of Assessors, gave the council a brief update on the assessors' efforts and conclusions.  â€œWe're still a town with a tax base that is 80 percent residential and 20 percent commercial/industrial,"" he said.  Nutting told the council that the valuations tend to lag behind the actual real estate market. He said this meant the values would likely rise in the future, as there has been good activity in the local market.  Council member Judith Pfeffer said that while the tax burden on local homeowners is not skyrocketing, it could be difficult for seniors in town to afford the increase. She asked that information about the senior work-off program â€” in which senior citizens can reduce their bills in exchange for volunteer work â€” be placed more prominently on the town website.  â€œI know, since we put this into effect, we've never turned anyone aside,"" she said.  â€” Mike Gleason can be reached at 508-634-7546 or mgleason@wickedlocal.com.

Getting the most from your state pension pot,"THE state pension is still the bedrock of most retirement incomes, which is why scrapping the triple lock was a massive blow for millions.

From April, the state pension will rise by 3.1%, giving those who retired before April 2016 an income of Â£141.85 a week, rising to Â£185.15 for those on the new state pension.
With inflation set to hit 6 or 7%, this is a cut in real terms and pensioners are feeling the pinch.  Here's how to make sure you are getting the maximum possible from the state system.  Target figure Pensioners had an average income of Â£19,240 in 2019/20, official figures show, of which Â£9,412 came from the state pension and other benefits.  The remaining Â£9,828 was generated by workplace and personal pensions, tax-free Isas and retirement savings.  Canada Life technical director Andrew Tully says: ""This shows the importance of saving for retirement under your own steam.""  That is not easy, though.  To buy a guaranteed income of Â£9,828 a year at age 66 would require a pension pot of approximately Â£192,000, he says. That would buy you a level, single life annuity. If you wanted that income to rise by 3% every year, you would need Â£294,000.  Yet Financial Conduct Authority figures show the average pension pot at retirement is just Â£61,897.  Topping up Many people do not get the full basic state pension because they haven't made sufficient qualifying National Insurance contributions while of working age.  You need 35 years of NI contributions to get the maximum amount, says Interactive Investor head of pensions and savings Becky O'Connor.  ""If you have less than 10 years of contributions, you get nothing at all,"" she adds.  Women who give up work to start a family, jobseekers, those with long-term illnesses and carers can all fall well behind.  ''  2.1 pensioners are living poverty in severe poverty  They can plug the shortfall by claiming NI credits, which top up your NI record if you cannot make them in the usual way.  Each year of NI contributions gives you an extra Â£250 a year in state pension.  Over a typical 20-year retirement, this could be worth Â£5,000, according to the government-funded guidance portal moneyhelper.org.uk. Visit gov.uk/national-insurance-credits to find out more.  Buy to boost Others have holes in their NI record because they were employed but had low earnings, or were self-employed but did not pay NI contributions because their profits were too small.  Those living or working outside Â£1,600 a year each. That money could transform lives.  Later life campaigner Baroness Ros Altmann wants a Government campaign to boost uptake. ""It should also consider offering pension credit to all over-60s, especially those in poor health,"" Baroness Altmann adds.  Visit gov.uk/pension-credit or call 0800 99 1234.  Age arguments The state pension age will rise to 67 from 2026 to 2028, then potentially to 68.  Yet life expectancy has actually been falling and campaigners argue these increases should be postponed or scrapped.  Baroness Altmann is also calling on the Government to introduce a new ""ill-health early pension"", allowing those with serious medical conditions to claim it from an earlier age.  She says the poorest stay healthy to around only age 50, while the wealthiest remain healthy to 70.  ""Those who started working early in life may have made 40 or 45 years worth of contributions and still aren't getting a penny in pension,"" she says.  The Government launched the latest review of the pension age in December, with the report due by May 2023. Any changes will not affect those who have already retired, but may have a big impact on future generations.  As the nation ages, the state pension will be more important than ever.  It will also get more costly.  the UK or who took career breaks for any other reason might also have gaps.  They can buy additional state pension by making Class 3 voluntary contributions, says Stephen Lowe, director at retirement adviser Just Group.  These cost Â£15.40 a week for one year's pension, or around Â£800 a year.  ""Each year you buy will boost your state pension by around Â£250 a year for life,"" Lowe says.  That Â£800 could pay for itself in just three years, and the longer you live, the more you benefit.  million in - half  You can only go back for the previous six years, so do not leave it too long to find out where you stand and start making up any shortfall.  Visit Government portal gov.uk/check-nationalinsurance-record to see exactly where you stand.

Pension credit is a means-tested benefit that tops up the incomes of the poorest retirees to Â£177.10 a week for single people and Â£270.30 for couples.  It also acts as a gateway to other benefits such as council tax reduction, heating support and free TV licences for the over-75s.

FICO says changes could give lift to credit scores,"You may soon earn a higher credit score if you balance your checkbook responsibly.

FICO, developer of the most widely used credit score, is rolling out a new score next year that considers how you manage your checking, savings and money market accounts in addition to how you pay back credit cards and loans. This additional information could help boost the credit scores of some of the 79million Americans who have poor credit histories, along with the 53million who have no credit score at all under the traditional FICO model. That, in turn, could help them qualify for a credit card or loan.
""We've been focused on financial inclusion, and what we've done can potentially improve access to credit for the majority of Americans who participate in it,"" said Sally Taylor-Shoff, vice president of score at FICO.  How does it work? If your credit score isn't high enough to qualify for a loan or credit card, or sits on the cusp of getting a better rate, a lender can offer to use your banking activity to generate an UltraFICO Score. You also can choose which accounts â€“ checking, savings or money market â€“ will be considered in the recalculation. The score uses the same 300-to-850 range that other FICO scores have.  Experian, one of the three main credit bureaus, will gather your bank account data using Finicity, a financial tech company, and send the new score plus a summary of your bank accounts to the lender for a second evaluation. Experian will maintain bank account data to address accuracy disputes.  It's possible that your credit score could decrease after the new banking information is added, according to Taylor-Shoff, so it's important to understand when your bank account could help you.  What is a good bank account? The biggest factors are average account balance and history of overdrawn accounts. Those who maintain an average balance of $400 and show no negative balances in the previous three months will benefit the most from the UltraFICO Score, Taylor-Shoff said. Other positive factors FICO considers include having more deposits than outflows, having an account open and active for some time, and regularly paying bills such as utilities and rent from these accounts.  Seven in 10 people who demonstrate responsible checking and savings account behavior can improve their score under the UltraFICO scoring system, the company said, some by as much as 20 points. That can translate into a lower interest rate or the difference between approval and denial.  The new score begins its pilot program at the beginning of next year.",1
"DIVORCE IS COMPLICATED, SO CONSULT FINANCIAL EXPERT","If you are going through a divorce, you may or may not need a therapist, and you may or may not need a lawyer, but you most certainly need to consult with a financial planner or accountant.

That's because the tax and other laws that govern property splits are complex and can affect the money you are left with years down the road.
Even an amicable separation can drain money out of both parties' pockets if care is not used when the assets are split.  ``Most couples try hard to arrive at a settlement that works for both partners,'' says William Newell, a financial planner in Sherborn, Mass. ``Unfortunately, what seems fair now may not remain equitable in the future.''  Newell's point is that when one partner (typically the wife) walks away with the house while the other (usually the husband) walks away with higher earning power and a retirement nest egg, the house-bound spouse usually ends up poorer and the other spouse ends up richer.  In addition to the expenses involved in upkeep of the house, the person who ends up with the house may later end up paying taxes on the home's sale, though this is less likely given recent changes in capital gains laws.  Furthermore, those changes may affect divorcing couples who sell their homes. In order to qualify for the $250,000 per person exclusion on home sales capital gains, you have to have been living in the house for at least two of the last five years before the sale. If one spouse moves out and it is four years before the house is sold, the spouse that moved out will lose that break.  It's also important to consider intangible assets, like employee benefits, future Social Security benefits and future earnings potential, when splitting up property, says Newell.  There are many other considerations, too. Alimony is tax deductible but child support is not, reports Mark Luscombe, a CPA and federal tax analyst for CCH Inc. in Riverwoods, Ill., a tax publishing company. But the Internal Revenue Service frowns on couples who use tax-deductible alimony instead of child support and can reclassify obvious child-focused alimony payments, such as those that end when a child turns 18, into non-deductible child support.  When parents split custody and support, it's important to work out ahead of time who will get to take the child as a dependent; only one parent can get the credits and exemptions associated with that.  Luscombe also notes that the period when the couple may be separated but is still legally married can be the most tax complex. They must either file a return together or, if they file separately, make sure that their returns match on items like what's deducted and what isn't.  Even if the children of the divorcing couple are very young, it's important that a plan for paying for college be worked out at the time of the divorce. Studies have shown that children of divorce go on to college less frequently than their cohorts from intact families. Often that is because the money just isn't there.  And retirement plans that don't get divided at the time of the divorce may not be able to protect their tax-favored status should the couple decide at a later time to use some of that money to settle a divorce-related obligation.  Finally, remember that in at least one key way divorce is just like all other significant life cycle events. As Violet Woodhouse, Victoria Collins and M.C. Blakeman point out in their book ``Divorce & Money'' (1998, Nolo Press), ``In divorce, everything takes longer and costs more than you imagine.''

Double the pain for savers as punishing inflation pushes prices up while rates fall,"Savers face a double whammy of punishing inflation and paltry savings rates.

Inflation jumped to 3.1 per cent in November, its highest level since March 2012.
It means there are no savings accounts that even match the rate of inflation, let alone outpace it.  The rate you can earn on some accounts has risen slightly since Bank of England base rate went up from 0.25 per cent to 0.5 per cent last month.  But overall, the average savings rate has actually fallen over the past 15 months.  When base rate last stood at 0.5 per cent in August last year, the average easy-access savings rate was 0.55 per cent, says data analyst Moneyfacts. Inflation was then running at 0.6 per cent.  Today, the average rate is a lower 0.47 per cent and inflation is up at 3.1 per cent.  Rising inflation and low interest rates reduces the spending power of your savings pot.  Even earning the top 1.3 per cent in the best easy-access account, its value drops by 1.8 per cent a year (3.1 per cent minus 1.3 per cent) after interest has been added.  This means that over a year, Â£10,000 will devalue to Â£9,820.  And if your cash is sitting in the average account, youâ€™ll lose 2.63 per cent a year, with Â£10,000 worth Â£9,737 after 12 months.  sy.morris@dailymail.co.uk",1
"Money in America: Stay focused, remember priorities for a fulfilling retirement","Editorâ€™s note : We reached out to executives who work in financial planning for their thoughts on what people should be thinking about at various life stages for wealth management. Here are comments as conveyed by Joe Vietri, branch network leader at Charles Schwab.

In Your 20s
While it might seem far-off, your 20s is the prime time to start saving and planning for retirement â€” thanks to the power of compound interest.  * Start saving for retirement early. It's a long way off, but put retirement on your list of goals. If your employer offers a 401(k) or a Roth 401(k), aim to contribute 10 percent to 15 percent of your income. The longer you wait to start, the larger the percentage youâ€™ll need to save. If you donâ€™t have a 401(k) or other employer-sponsored plan, open a Roth IRA. A Roth is a good choice for a young person because, while you donâ€™t get the tax advantage up front, withdrawals are tax-free after age 59Â½, when youâ€™ll likely be in a higher tax bracket.  * Donâ€™t leave â€œfree moneyâ€ on the table. Most companies will match a portion of your 401(k) contributions. Sign up and contribute at least enough to qualify for the max. Some employers also may make annual contributions to your tax-advantaged health savings accounts or offer the option to buy company stock at a discount. Familiarize yourself with these benefits and take advantage.  * Invest for growth. While youâ€™re young, invest in a growth strategy since youâ€™ve got time on your side to recover from a potential down market. Be diversified and think about your risk tolerance, but at this stage, you should focus on asset growth.  * Start a rainy-day fund. Schwabâ€™s Modern Wealth Index (MWI) found that only 28 percent of millennials have an emergency fund to cover three months of expenses. Be sure to prepare for emergencies, such as job loss, with three to six monthsâ€™ worth of living expenses.  * Pay down debt. MWI found only 33 percent of millennials make all loan payments and 31 percent pay their credit cards in full each month. Student loans and credit card debt can add up, and missing payments can hurt your credit score, which matters for rent and loan assessments.  In Your 30s  As you enter your 30s, there are competing demands on your time and money. Whether it be saving for your kidsâ€™ education or contributing toward your retirement, here are key things to keep in mind for these years.  * Keep saving. If youâ€™re just starting, aim to save 15 percent to 20 percent of your income. If you've been saving 10 percent to 15 percent for retirement since your 20s, good work, and keep it up!  * Get a financial plan. Planning is one of the most critical factors to successful investing, but Schwabâ€™s research reveals that less than a quarter of Americans have a written financial plan. A comprehensive financial plan is your road map to help you stay on track with your financial goals and manage wealth, particularly as your life evolves and finances become more complicated.  * Remember your old 401(k) when changing jobs. Your 30s are a time of professional advancement, so if you are changing jobs, donâ€™t blindly leave your 401(k) savings in the rear view. When you switch jobs, you can leave your money where it is, roll it over into your new employer's 401(k) plan, or roll it over into an individual retirement account. You can also cash it out, but thatâ€™s almost never a good idea. To decide which is best for you, consider how your fees, taxes and investment options may be impacted.  * Start saving early for kids' college. If you begin investing $300 per month as soon as your child is born, with a 6 percent rate of return, you could have $115,000 by the time he/she reaches age 18. Yet, if you donâ€™t start saving until your child is 10 years old, the final amount will be roughly $37,000.  * Create an estate plan. At the very minimum, you should establish a will that names a guardian for your children (if you have any). You also should make sure you name beneficiaries for all retirement accounts, as these designations will take precedence over your will.  In Your 40s  Youâ€™re likely earning more as your career advances, but youâ€™re also facing more financial pressures. Itâ€™s easy to get distracted, so here are some tips to stay focused.  * Double down on savings. Keep retirement at the top of your priorities. If you havenâ€™t started saving, set aside 25 percent of your salary. You are probably contributing enough to take advantage of your employerâ€™s 401(k) match, but consider maximizing your annual contribution: $18,000 for 2017 for workers under age 50. For both traditional and Roth IRAs, the maximum you can contribute is $5,500 for workers under the age of 50.  * Update your financial plan. You should get in the habit of reviewing your financial plan annually and at major life events to make sure itâ€™s current and that your investment portfolio is aligned with your short- and long-term goals, as well as your risk tolerance. At this stage, you may think about a second home or early retirement, so itâ€™s important to crunch the numbers to see what it will take to reach them.  * Protect yourself and your family. Now that you have more money working for you, make sure youâ€™re protected. Look into disability insurance and consider life insurance if you have dependents.  * Donâ€™t be too conservative. While you shouldnâ€™t take the same risks you did in your 20s, you still have 20+ years to reap potential gains from investments. Being cautious now could mean coming up short later, so consider having a large portion of your portfolio in equities.  * Know your tax profile. Understand how taxes fit into your financial picture, now and in the future.  In Your 50s  As you approach peak earning years in your 50s, it makes sense to start thinking more specifically about retirement planning; it may be only 15 years away. Consider these priorities to make sure you are on track.  * Estimate your retirement expenses. Begin thinking about when you want to retire, where you want to live and what you want to do. Will you travel or work part-time, or move to a different city? Once you know your vision, you can determine how much your retirement is going to cost and how you are going to pay for it.  * Stay on top of your financial plan and your portfolio. Review and update your financial plan and your investment portfolio and consider when it makes sense to begin shifting to a more conservative asset allocation as you near retirement.  * Consider long-term-care insurance. Nowâ€™s a practical time to think about it.  * Consider boosting your savings level. As your salary increases, so should your retirement contributions. Starting at age 50, investors can contribute an extra $6,000 to their 401(k) for an annual contribution of $24,000, and an extra $1,000 to their IRA for an annual contribution of $6,500, per current IRS rules.  * Update your estate plan. Make sure that your will and beneficiaries are up to date and that your assets are appropriately titled.  In Your 60s  With retirement nearing, itâ€™s imperative that people in their 60s focus on preparations for life after work.  * Understand your real spending. While many guess how much they spend, itâ€™s important to be accurate â€” so dig up bank statements and look at what the real outflow is.  * Tackle debt and major expenses. Fifty seven percent of Americans canâ€™t make loan payments on time and 63 percent hold credit card debt (according to recent Schwab research), so this is the time to pay down â€œbadâ€ debt before it becomes a burden in retirement.  * Decide when to take Social Security. Many people file for Social Security too early, leaving thousands of dollars on the table. You should keep in mind, the longer you wait up to age 70, the bigger your check once you begin collecting.  * Sign up for Medicare: Unless youâ€™re still working, you must sign up by age 65 or face a penalty. As medical costs can be a big part of retirement expenses, be sure to look into a supplemental policy, too.  * Fine-tune your retirement income plan. Review your projected expenses, add up your reliable sources of income and figure out how your portfolio will cover the gap. Consider gradually moving to a more conservative asset allocation, but donâ€™t walk away from growth: Retirement can last a long time â€” approximately 20 years or more.  In Your Retirement  With Americans living longer than ever, retirement is increasingly becoming its own journey rather than a destination. For a lengthy, fulfilling retirement, start with this checklist.  * Review your situation. Project what youâ€™ll need to cover one monthâ€™s and one yearâ€™s costs, divvying expenses into essential (housing, health care) and discretionary (trips) categories.  * Explore retirement income strategies. A few common approaches include relying upon 1) interest and dividends only, 2) a â€œtotal returnâ€ strategy, which uses a combination of interest, dividends and withdrawals from principal, and 3) a â€œtotal returnâ€ with an annuity that incorporates annuity income into a ""total return"" approach.  * Match your investments to your goals and needs. While itâ€™s a crucial factor to consider in creating your retirement income plan, itâ€™s unlikely that savings will ever outpace long-term inflation. One way to counteract this is keeping a segment of savings in growth-oriented stock investments (stocks, mutual funds, ETFs). Balancing funds â€“ in any distribution â€“ between fixed income, cash investments and stocks is essential to long-term success.  * Rebalance annually and stay flexible. Annual retirement portfolio rebalancing is especially important when you're retired, as a portfolio that's out of balance can leave you with more risk or less growth potential than you want. You should periodically revisit your retirement portfolio asset allocation to stay aligned with your investment goals and expected time horizon.  Did you find this article useful?

GETTING PERSONAL: Giving Up Vacation To Boost The 401(k)
","
A Dow Jones Newswires Column



NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Putting off your vacation today may someday help
you in retirement.

 Instead of having to forfeit your vacation days by the end of the year, you may be able to contribute the cash equivalent to your defined contribution plans instead.    Late last year, the IRS approved such an arrangement requested by a local government entity. Although the private letter ruling - which supports an earlier IRS ruling in 1995 - only applies to the specific individuals that requested the opinion, it does provide insight into how the IRS would treat similar situations, said Nicholas Kaster, senior tax analyst on pensions at CCH Inc., a publisher of tax information in Riverwoods, Ill.    In this case, the IRS ruled that because employees did not have the option to receive cash in lieu of unused vacation, the contributions to a qualified plan would not count as wages and, as a result, would be free from federal income taxes and FICA taxes.    What's more, employees could potentially stash away more than the maximum contribution limit (currently $12,000 if under 50 and $14,000 if 50 or older) allowed under most defined contribution plans. The latest ruling stated the rules were applicable to a defined contribution plan with profit-sharing features, which could include 401(k) plans or profit-sharing plans.    But before rushing off to your human resources department to sign up, be aware that the ruling may be difficult to implement at most companies.    In fact, this type of arrangement would work best at plans that cover government employees, collective-bargaining unions, or some churches because they are typically exempt from IRS discrimination tests, said Michael Weddell, retirement consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide in Southfield, Mich. Such plans are more likely to be found in industries with strong unions, said Weddell, who added that he received a call earlier this week from a client in the airline industry who was interested in implementing this plan for its unionized pilots.    For most of corporate America, however, such an arrangement might be more theoretical at this point, especially since the IRS has tightened up nondiscrimination rules last year. Plans must prove to the IRS each year that they are not disproportionately benefiting highly paid workers at the expense of the rank-and-file.    Typically, a plan that would allow employees to contribute the value of their unused vacation days to their retirement plans would benefit highly paid persons more than lower paid employees, said David Wray, president of Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America. In general, higher-paid people have more vacation days but fewer opportunities to use them. Moreover, the value of their vacation days are worth more.    ""Companies have reviewed this periodically,"" Wray said. ""It doesn't work for nearly all plans...(because) if you permit this program, you throw the plans out of compliance with the discrimination rules.""    For this to work, employers would have to structure the plan so that employees would not have a choice of receiving unused days as cash compensation.    Under the ruling, the IRS deemed the vacation contribution as ""non-elective,"" or a contribution that's made by the employer and can have no cash alternative. In contrast, an ""elective"" contribution occurs when an employee chooses to contribute a percentage of his or her pay into a 401(k) plan, for example, instead of taking cash. Because vacation day payments aren't subject to the same rules that govern elective deferrals, which is how employee 401(k) contributions are characterized, an employees could contribute more than the annual limits.    Besides amending their plans, employers would also have to make sure their vacation pay policy is modified to fit their needs such that employees do not ""underuse their vacation because they'd rather bank that,"" said Weddell of Watson Wyatt.    ""In some instances, if there's enough of a clamor, an employer may look at whether they can amend plans to include this provision,"" said Richard O'Donnell, pensions specialist at RIA, a New York provider of tax information and software to tax pros.

Investors Chronicle - magazine and web content: Ease the pain of soaring uni fees with the Bank of Mum & Dad.,"University fees have tripled in recent years, so we show you what options you have to help your children, if you're the Bank of Mum & Dad.

Remember when the government used to pay students to get degrees? It's now over a decade since tertiary education waved a sad goodbye to free university places, and as university costs have spiralled in recent years, the bank of Mum & Dad is increasingly stepping in. No one wants to see their children lugging around the tiresome ball and chain of student debt worth GBP50,000 when they graduate, but before stepping in you need to know the facts.
If you're a parent, the reality of these costs might make you squirm. But by getting a breakdown of the expenses ahead of time and planning how much you want to subsidise your children, you'll minimise the shock when they eventually fly the nest, settle in overpriced student halls, and adopt the arm-out palm up ""I need money"" stance.  The overall cost of sending a young adult to university for three years depends on a number of factors:  aÃ¯ Â½Ã¯ Â½ Where they study (highly ranked universities are the most expensive);  aÃ¯ Â½Ã¯ Â½ Their accommodation (rent in some regions is higher than others); and  aÃ¯ Â½Ã¯ Â½ How much their lifestyle costs (will they be eating super noodles?).  Students who started their degree last autumn will graduate with an average debt of GBP53,330, according to data from insurance company LV=. The loan comprises two parts: up to GBP9,000 a year for fees, and a maximum maintenance loan of up to GBP5,500 if they're living away from home outside London, or GBP7,675 if they're living away from home in London.  But if you think the loan will cover all the costs, think again. If your household earnings are less than GBP42,600 you can apply for a bursary, but if you earn more than that, the help stops at the basic maintenance loans.  But the maintenance loan simply isn't enough. The average university student will have just GBP11.15 left in student support to live on after paying for their rent and utility bills, a National Union of Students (NUS) survey revealed earlier this year. Santander research reveals four out of 10 students have a part time job, but if they're in the 60 per cent non working majority, it's likely they'll be asking you for money to cover either their rent or living expenses - adding thousands onto the actual cost of their degree.  AÃ¯ Â½  Should you let your child get a student loan?  No one wants to let their children start their adult life with a mountain of debt if they can help it. But is student debt really that bad? The politicians claim it isn't anywhere near as toxic for your finances as ""proper debt"". It's true that student loans aren't quite the same as ordinary loans: you don't pay back a penny until your're earning GBP21,000 or more, repayments are capped at 9 per cent of your income, and if you haven't paid it off within 30 years, the remainder of the debt is cancelled.  But don't let this friendly packaging lull you into the idea that this is not real debt. Post 2012 student debt grows at a rate of Retail Price Index inflation (RPI) plus 3 per cent, meaning the longer you don't pay it off, the bigger it becomes. As a result, the government has already admitted half of students will have so much debt their loans will be cancelled after 30 years. So unless your kids are in the top 50 per cent of graduate earners, they can expect to spend the vast majority of their working lives funnelling 9 per cent of their wages into debt repayments if they take out a full loan. That 9 per cent a year is a crucial piece of income they could have used to buy a house or raise a child. And financial advisers say that due to the mounting interest on unpaid post 2012 student loans, it makes most financial sense for graduates to prioritise paying it off above saving money or buying a house.  If you can afford to support your children through university but you're not sure of the best way to go about it, here's some ideas on how to do it.  AÃ¯ Â½  Give them a lump sum before they go to university  A lump sum could be put towards living costs, used for tuition fees or both. The downside here is that if your child knows they're being subsidised they might be likely to spend more frivolously, and the money has to go in their name unless you put it in a trust, which can be very expensive. You need to ask yourself if you can really trust your 18-year old with a lump sum? If not, Lucy Brennan, partner at Saffrey Champness, suggests paying your child's tuition fees upfront. Another perk with this is that it counts as upkeep of the family rather than a gift. Doing this exempts it from tax, unlike gifts worth more than GBP3,000 which are taxable if you die within seven years of you giving them, so this could be a good move if you have a lump sum to give.  But on the other hand, being upfront with your children about how you're going to help them can be a positive step. 17-year-old A-level student, Beatrice Locke, is hoping to get a place at the London School of Economics next year, one of the most expensive universities in the UK. But because she has already sat down with her parents to talk about how they can help her, she knows where she stands and is planning to get a part time job alongside her studies to help fund her tuition fees.  AÃ¯ Â½  Give them a lump sum when they've graduated  Another option is to let them get the full student loan and then pay some or all of it off when they finally graduate. This option also gives you a few more years to save or invest to raise the funds. If you wait there's also the option of not telling them you're going to help, which will probably make them think twice before spending half their student loan by the end of fresher's week. But if you're waiting to give a lump sum as a gift, remember you have to live seven years after you give a gift worth over GBP3,000 in any one year until it is free from inheritance tax.  AÃ¯ Â½  A loan from the bank of Mum & Dad  If you don't like the thought of your children being in debt to the Student Loans Company you could think about loaning them the money instead. You can set up this arrangement on a trust basis or have an agreement legally drawn up for an initial fee of around GBP500 to GBP1,000. But Patrick Connolly, financial planner at Chase de Vere, says both options are ""fraught with danger. Most people don't bother with a legal agreement because of the offence it can cause within the family if kids don't feel like their parents trust them. But on the other hand, if you loan your kids GBP50,000 and they are unable or unwilling to pay it back, there's not much you can do if there's no legal paperwork"".  AÃ¯ Â½  Giving them regular income  Because maintenance loans don't cover rent and living costs it's common for parents to give children money every month for everyday living costs. This option allows you more control over your children's budget, but you need to watch out for your salary falling behind the rental market and living costs.  AÃ¯ Â½  Are you a grandparent wanting to support your children through university? Next week we'll look at some effective ways you can put your money to use.  AÃ¯ Â½  READ MORE...

Being prepared  ,"PEOPLE'S attitude to money is amazing.  

They spend most of their lives working but many do not give more than a passing thought to what will happen to their money when they die.  
Almost 60 per cent of people die without a will and many others use a ""do-it-yourself"" job or grab the first free offer they find.    Badly constructed clauses in DIY will kits can lead to confusion.    For example, in your will you state ""I give the contents of my home to . . . ""    Does this include the car or cars in the garage?    Does a bequest to children include step-children?    Is a bequest to sons and daughters in equal shares mean all children are to share equally, or that the sons receive 50 per cent and the daughters 50 per cent?    Does a bequest to grandchildren include only those who are alive at the date of your death?    Take care with assets such as property and shares, because the introduction of capital gains tax, and the propensity to divorce and re-marry, have added complications.    You may own two investment properties of equal value but, if one is pre-CGT, and the other is post-CGT, the beneficiaries may not receive legacies of equal value.    If some properties are mortgaged and some are debt-free, your will needs to spell out whether the beneficiaries must take the properties subject to the existing mortgages or whether the loans are to be paid off by the estate before properties are transferred.    Estate planning can save costly problems later.    Make sure you involve your solicitor, accountant and financial adviser in you will.    * Noel Whittaker is a director and proper authority holder for Whittaker Macnaught Pty Ltd licensed securities dealer.

Kyoung Walker Answers your money queries
","
Kyoung Walker Answers your money queries worthy sacrifice My husband and I
are aged 53 and 54. Our combined current superannuation balance is $175,000
and we salary sacrifice a combined total of $22,800 each year. We would like
to retire in six years with an income of $35,000 a year. Are we on target?
Many factors that we cannot predict influence retirement capital - including
legislative and taxation changes.



Let us assume your income in retirement needs to last 22 years and that you
actually need $35,000 in today's dollars (after inflation, this equates to
$41,791 a year in six years. We have assumed an inflation rate of 3 per cent
a year).

 Based on these assumptions, you need capital of $600,000 for your required income.    You contribute $22,800 a year into superannuation. After 15 per cent contributions tax you are adding $19,380 to your superannuation balance each year.    We can assume your super portfolio will earn an average of 8.5 per cent per annum over the next six years. This will give you capital of $430,000 - short of the target value you need.    Have a look at your underlying superannuation investments. Look for growth investments (such as Australian and international shares and property trusts) rather than cash and fixed interest). Increase your super contributions as much as you can.    The other option is to retire later. On the current figures you will reach your retirement target in nine years rather than six.    self starter I'd like information about setting up my own super fund. Could you recommend any literature or organisation helping people run their own super fund? Good superannuation literature is now widely available from some government and association websites.    A good place to start is ASFA (the Australian Superannuation Funds Association). On their site - www.asfa.asn.au- you can select the Small/DIY super fund section and get quality information for free.    If you contact the superannuation section of the Australian Taxation Office, they will send you a booklet about setting up and running your own super fund.    You also can buy books via amazon.com or a quality bookstore. Popular books are Noel Whittaker`s Big Dollars: Superannuation Made Simple; Barbara Smith and Ed Koken's Super Simple Superannuation and Noelle Kelleher's DIY Superannuation.    I also would highly recommend you don't proceed without professional help because of the highly complex compliance issues.    growth asset My wife and I are in our forties and want to invest $250,000. We have seen a financial adviser for ideas but would appreciate a second opinion.    It is difficult for me to give you specific advice without knowing your individual circumstances and why you want to invest. Everybody wants his or her money to grow. The adviser's challenge is recommending investments that meet your needs.    If you do not need to access this money in the next five to 10 years, more investment options are available.    If you have 10 years to invest and if tax-effectiveness is important to you, gearing is an investment alternative (depending on your other income sources). For example, with your $250,000, you could margin lend $150,000 to make total investable funds of $400,000. This carries significant risk because you are borrowing to invest.    If you don't need this money until retirement, consider superannuation because of its tax-effectiveness. But you need to consider that you cannot access these funds until you are 55 or have permanently retired.    If you do like neither superannuation nor gearing, find investments that combine tax benefits and growth. In addition to the normal managed funds, which invest in a wide range of assets, try other specialised investments such as property trusts and share funds, which aim for a high level of franking credits.    The important thing to remember is that when the return is higher, so are the risks, especially in the short term.    Kyoung Walker is a financial planner with Bank of Melbourne.

Self-funded retirees urged to tap home equity as budget critics come under fire,"Self-funded retirees struggling to stay afloat have been urged by the federal government to tap into their home's equity to get through the recession.

Assistant Minister for Superannuation Jane Hume acknowledged self-funded retirees had taken a hit during the coronavirus pandemic from the combination of lower interest rates, reduced bank dividends, and a drop in rental income.
However, the federal budget did not include any additional measures to help them specifically.  When asked what self-funded retirees should do if they were struggling during the recession, Senator Hume suggested they look to the pension loan scheme, saying ""the savings people have put into their family home"" were part of the retirement income system.  The reverse mortgage-style scheme allows retirees to take out a loan from the government to cover living expenses, secured against their real estate, and receive payments of up to 1.5 times the pension rate. It was expanded last year to allow access by self-funded retirees, leading to a bigger take-up.  ""That's a really innovative and very inexpensive way of adding to their income,"" Senator Hume said.  ""I wouldn't be surprised ... if it's something people turn their mind to now as another tool in the kit to help them through the most disruptive and uncertain part of managing their personal balance sheets during the pandemic.""  Association of Independent Retirees president Wayne Strandquist said many older Australians would not consider the option.  ""Retirees in general are quite reluctant to [tap] into their private residence to provide short-term cash flow,"" he said. Many saw it as affecting the inheritance they would leave, and there was an unwillingness to let the government have a lien on their estate.  Prime Minister Scott Morrison said those trying to pick losers from the budget were pitting groups against each other and undermining Australia's prosperity.  He defended his budget against accusations it did little for women and older workers.  ""There will be voices that will try and set young people against older people, women against men, jobs in one sector versus jobs in another sector,"" Mr Morrison said.  ""They are the voices of division that will undermine the future economic prosperity of all Australians.""  Social Services Minister Anne Ruston said ""every single measure in the budget is available forwomen"" and ""women can take advantage of, you know, driving on the new infrastructure and roads"".  The budget contained a new $4 billion hiring incentive for bosses to take on unemployed people aged under 35 in the next year.  Data from the Bureau of Statistics on Thursday showed the number of payroll jobs held by people under the age of 20 was 4.7 per cent higher in late September than it was in mid-March.  But among 20-to-29-year-olds, payroll job numbers are down by 6.3 per cent. The situation is far worse, however, for those aged over 70 whose jobs are down by 11.3 per cent. For those in their 60s, jobs have dropped 6.1 per cent.  Mr Morrison pointed to an Abbott government wage subsidy program that offers up to $10,000 to employers who hire people aged over 50. In its 6?? years, it has supported 50,000 people.  Right now, 3000 workers were backed by the scheme, Mr Morrison told Parliament.  There are 623,500 Australians aged 45 and older on JobSeeker unemployment payments.  Mr Morrison accused Labor leader Anthony Albanese of opposing getting young people back into jobs.  ""I support young people. I just don't see why you have to do that at the expense of older workers,"" Mr Albanese said.  EY chief economist Jo Masters said the budget was heavily focused on young people and jobs in male-dominated sectors with important decisions such as the size of the JobSeeker payment pushed off until later in the year.  She said there were would be substantial issues when the JobKeeper wage subsidy finished next year, with women at particular risk.  ""What happens to the woman who is 36 years old and loses their job?"" she said.  ""We know young people are facing a tough situation and the government is helping them, but there's nothing for women in this budget for those who have lost their job or were out of work before this all started.""  Labor released a women's budget statement on Thursday, casting a gender lens across the government's policies.  ""Every economist will tell you that if you don't apply that lens and don't get a better outcome for women, not just women suffer, we all do,"" Mr Albanese said.",1
PERS: Updated database available that includes 2014 public employee retirees,"May 16--About 7,600 members of Oregon's Public Employees Retirement System headed for the retirement exits in 2014 -- about 10 percent of those currently eligible to retire due to age or length of service.

The Oregonian/OregonLive has posted an updated version of the state's public pension roll that captures most of those new retirees. The data is provided to the news organization by PERS under a legal settlement reached in 2011.
With the exception of members who chose to take lump sum payments or have died and passed their annuities on to a beneficiary, the database includes each retirees' name, monthly benefit, months of service, retirement formula and final payroll salary.  The latest version includes 5,596 members who retired in 2014. That excludes 1,600 retirees who took lump sum payments or filed their paperwork late in the year.  Members who retired in 2014 are earning an average pension benefit of about $25,000 and had an average of about 19 years of public service. The benefit represents about 44 percent of final salary.  About 850 of the 2014 retirees in the database had 30 years or more of service -- considered a full career. Their average annual benefit was $54,000.  Roger Dailey, a plastic surgeon at Oregon Health & Science University, was the top 2014 beneficiary, with a starting annual pension of $392,340. He is currently the third highest paid beneficiary in the entire system. Though ostensibly retired, OHSU's website says he is still accepting new patients.  His OHSU colleague, neurosurgeon Edward Neuwelt, began retirement with an annual benefit of $248,547. OHSU also lists him as accepting new patients.  Former University of Oregon Defensive Coordinator Nick Aliotti was right on Neuwelt's heels, with a starting annual pension of $248,182.  Dailey, Neuwelt and Aliotti are all among the top 10 beneficiaries in the system. And thanks to the Oregon Supreme Court's recent ruling, they, along with all PERS retirees, will continue to receive annual cost of living increases of up to 2 percent.  But they are clearly the outliers. The median benefit among 2014 retirees is $1,575 a month, or $18,900 a year.  - Ted Sickinger  tsickinger@oregonian.com  503-221-8505; @tedsickinger  -----  ___  (c)2015 The Oregonian (Portland, Ore.)

Intervention was the right thing to do,"News Intervention was the right thing to do FINANCE  The Bank of England's extraordinary intervention in the UK Government bond market was absolutely necessary. Despite representing an embarrassing U-turn on its recently announced plans to sell Â£80bn of gilts into the markets, its emergency purchases helped restore stability to UK financial markets.  The need for temporary giltbuying was catalysed by problems arising in UK pension funds, which hold hundreds of billions of pounds in UK gilts.  Record low gilt yields in recent years meant government bond prices rose sharply, earning pension funds large profits. However, with global inflation and interest rates rising all over the world, bond yields have risen during 2022, resulting in significant capital losses for pension investors. The money received from past profits helped them manage those losses but in recent days the situation dramatically worsened.  The loss of confidence in sterling through September sparked a rushed exit from UK assets, pushing 30-year gilt yields above 4 per cent. The day after International Monetary Fund warnings about the direction of UK economic policy, international investors accelerated sales or shorting of UK gilts, causing yields to crash through 5 per cent.  The sudden collapse in gilt prices led financial companies to demand more cash collateral to cover pension fund losses. A Â£1bn pension fund was, perhaps, suddenly facing cash calls of over Â£100m. Instead of the usual one or two weeks to allow time for orderly sales, they demanded the money in one or two days. This created a negative spiral because pension funds had run out of buffers and faced either selling gilts or other assets into the falling markets or risking default.  The Bank of England's remit to protect financial stability, required it to step in and stop the situation spinning out of control, reducing 30-year yields to 4 per cent.  Pension funds have been stabilised but it is important to stress that final-salary scheme members were not going to lose all their pensions. They are protected by the Pension Protection Fund, which insures 80-90 per cent of their promised pension.  Defined contribution pension scheme members, whose pensions depend on their investments, and do not promise a specific pension, may have been more severely affected. These funds often have significant investments in gilts and bonds, supposedly to reduce risk and provide stability, but rising bond yields have caused large losses. There is no insurance or employer to underpin these pensions and further bond market crises would mean even lower pensions for members.  The Bank of England's intervention is only a temporary measure. More must be done to restore market confidence. If we are to avoid ongoing financial crises, and pension fund damage, Government must restore confidence in UK economic management.

SIX STATES FILE A CHALLENGE TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION PROGRAM,"SIX STATES FILE A CHALLENGE TO THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION'S STUDENT LOAN CANCELLATION PROGRAM LINCOLN, Neb., Sept. 29 -- The Nebraska attorney general issued the following news release:  Today, six states filed a challenge to the Biden Administration's student loan cancellation program in federal court in Missouri. In it, they ask the Court for an immediate temporary restraining order pausing the program. Prompt relief is being sought because the Biden Administration has indicated it will start cancelling loan balances as early as next week.  Just a few months ago, the Supreme Court warned federal agencies against ""asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted"" by statute. Yet the Biden Administration's recently announced student loan cancellation program-the Mass Debt Cancellation-does precisely that.  Determined to pursue across-the-board debt cancellation and stymied by repeated failures to achieve that goal through legislation, the Administration resorted to the now-concluded COVID-19 pandemic and a federal law that applies in the context of military operations or national emergencies as its justification for taking this dramatic action.  In addition to being economically unwise and inherently unfair, the Biden Administration's Mass Debt Cancellation is another example in a long line of unlawful regulatory actions. No statute permits President Biden to unilaterally relieve millions of individuals from their obligation to pay loans they voluntarily assumed.  This burden of economic loss will do little to benefit the working class and the poor. The majority of the Mass Debt Cancellation will accrue to the debt borrowers in the top 60 percent of the income distribution. It is fundamentally unfair for those who can least afford it to provide through their tax dollars relief to the well-off who can afford to pay their own loans.  The law that the Biden Administration relies on is known as the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003 (HEROES Act). But it has never been used to do anything like this before. It is inconceivable that when Congress passed the HEROES Act, it thought it was authorizing the President to unilaterally decree something like the Mass Debt Cancellation, which will result in around half a trillion dollars in losses to the federal treasury.  The Mass Debt Cancellation is not remotely tailored to address the effects of the pandemic on federal student loan borrowers, as required by the HEROES Act. The Cancellation instead disregards the Act's objectives and express requirements and distorts the Act beyond recognition in the service of the Administration's political agenda on student loans. It is unlawful and arbitrary agency action, and it should be immediately set aside.  No borrower will be disadvantaged by an immediate court order delaying the loan cancellation program because loan repayments and interest accruals have been paused since March 2020.  States joining in the filing include: Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, and South Carolina.

"Biden touts Inflation Reduction Act, critics say student loan cancellation offsets gains","Biden touts Inflation Reduction Act, critics say student loan cancellation offsets gains Missouri Western State College ; St Joseph, MO - news  By  (The Center Square) - President Joe Biden touted the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act during a speech Tuesday, but analysts point to the recent student debt cancellation as an ""offset"" of any reduced inflation and federal debt reduction.  Biden, joined by Vice President Kamala Harris, praised spending items in the bill, pointing to deficit reductions in the legislation and overall since the COVID-era spike in relief spending.  ""So I don't want to hear it anymore about big-spending Democrats,"" he said. ""We spend, but we pay.""  A recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, however, found that that the cost to taxpayers to cancel $10,000 to $20,000 per borrower in student debt will more than offset the debt and inflationary benefits of the IRA.  The Congressional Budget Office said that the IRA will cut the deficit by $238 billion over the next decade.  More from this section  AHA News: She Had a Stroke During a Video Call With Her Congressional Representative  How to Start Saving for Your Kids' College  Fewer Pet Neuterings in Pandemic Means Shelters Are Filling Up  But the CRFB estimates Biden's debt cancellation will cost taxpayers more than double that amount, offsetting those gains twofold.  ""The student debt cancellation and relief measures recently announced by the Biden Administration will cost roughly $500 billion over ten years under our estimates, wiping out the $238 billion of ten-year deficit reduction from the Inflation Reduction Act more than two times over,"" the group said. ""In total, we estimate the student debt proposals will cost as much as the first 16 years of IRA deficit reduction on a nominal basis and the first 21 years of deficit reduction on a present value basis.""  The group goes on to say its analysis is likely ""generous"" in the Biden administration's favor.  ""Our estimates may prove overly generous, as they are based on our central estimate, do not incorporate a likely uptick in loans as a result of the new policies, and assume smooth implementation of the IRA,"" the CRFB said. ""Under our higher-end estimate of the student loan plan, it will consume roughly 18 years of IRA savings on a nominal basis and roughly 25 years on a present value basis. If expiring Affordable Care Act subsidy expansions were extended without offsets in the IRA, the student loan plan might consume over 25 years of the savings on a nominal basis, and it is not clear whether such a plan would ever generate enough deficit reduction to finance the student debt cancellation on a present value basis.  ""In addition, as we have pointed out before, the inflationary effects of the new student debt plan will far outweigh any disinflationary effects from the IRA,"" the group added.

"A GOP attorney general says people are 'celebrating prematurely' Biden's student-loan forgiveness, suggesting lawsuits are to come","A GOP attorney general says people are 'celebrating prematurely' Biden's student-loan forgiveness, suggesting lawsuits are to come * Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich told CNBC student-loan forgiveness is being lauded ""prematurely.""  * He said he is looking for ways to legally challenge Biden's debt relief.  * Other GOP lawmakers like Ted Cruz have also said they are pursuing ways to block the policy.  Another Republican politician voiced intentions to legally challenge President Joe Biden's student-loan forgiveness.  Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovichtold CNBC on Tuesday it might be too soon to bank on Biden's announcement to forgive $10,000 to $20,000 in student-loan debt for federal borrowers making under $125,000 a year. He said Biden is on ""very, very shaky legal grounds right now.""  ""I think there's a lot of people celebrating prematurely,"" Brnovich told CNBC. ""A lot of other people are very upset about this, not only because of legal arguments, but because they believe it's fundamentally unfair.""  The Biden administration said the authority to wipe out that debt is granted under the HEROES Act of 2003, which gives the Education Secretary the ability to waive or modify student-loan balances in connection with a national emergency, like COVID-19.  But critics of the plan have argued that is an overreach of the authority, and the legal grounds do not exist for the president to cancel that amount of student debt.  Brnovich added that a lawsuit should be filed ""sooner rather than later"" so borrowers do not become to reliant on relief, and he said he's confident he can find a plaintiff that could challenge Biden's actions.  ""If we can bring a challenge, we will bring a challenge,"" Brnovich said.  While there was legal debate prior to Biden's announcement of loan forgiveness, the conversation has only amplified since then. Biden's Education and Justice Departments both released memos concluding the Education Secretary does have the authority to enact one-time blanket relief due to pandemic-caused financial hardship, and they also rescinded a memo from former President Donald Trump saying the authority to cancel student debt broadly does not exist.  Still, Republicans and conservative groups have said they are pursuing legal routes to overturn the policy. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, for example, toldThe Washington Post that he is ""brainstorming"" ways to block debt relief after acknowledging it could be difficult to find a plaintiff. Abby Shafroth, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, also previously told Insider that it will be difficult to prove someone has suffered a concrete injury as a result of Biden's debt cancellation.  For now, it's unclear how any legal action will progress, and the Education Department is continuing to tell federal borrowers to prepare for an application for relief to become live in early October, and they will have until the end of next year to submit their form.

Energy deal ban: Ofgem green lights major change for Brits - â€˜More resilient and fairâ€™,"Energy deal ban: Ofgem green lights major change for Brits - 'More resilient and fair' OFGEM is set to ban energy suppliers from only offering discount deals to new customers, in an attempt to stop more energy firms going bust.  The policy will mean that these deals must be offered to both new and existing customers, as well as stopping loyal customers being penalised for not switching energy suppliers. Since September last year, more than two dozen energy companies have gone bust, having relied on new customers with discounted deals and loss making prices to stay solvent.

The policy, set to be implemented on April 14, will remain in place for six months before Ofgem reviews it and decides whether it will become permanent.  Simon Oscroft, co-founder of energy supplier So Energy, said the policy would, ""help build a more resilient and fairer energy energy market as we begin to emerge from this crisis"".  In a statement, Ofgem said: ""The energy market has faced a huge challenge due to the unprecedented increase in global gas prices, a once-in-a-30-year event.

Couple who bought B&Q plant for just Â£12 discover its leaves are worth Â£170 each,"Money Couple who bought B&Q plant for just Â£12 discover its leaves are worth Â£170 each Harry Langstaff and Amy Biffa couldn't believe it when they spotted the super rare monstera Aurea marmorata plant had been marked down from Â£24 to Â£12 in their local B&Q  A couple are quids in after they purchased a rare plant from B&Q for just Â£12 -but its leaves are worth Â£170 each.  Harry Langstaff and Amy Biffa spotted the plant had been marked down from Â£24 to Â£12.  The couple believe it had been reduced due to yellow colouring that had appeared on its leaves, which staff could've mistaken for a disease -but this actually means the plant is extremely rare.  Harry and Amy picked up a monstera Aurea marmorata -which can sell for anywhere between Â£200 for a clipping, to Â£2,000 for a whole plant.  The amateur botanists said they felt like they were ""winning the lottery"" when they spotted the discount.  It comes after plant collectors urged shoppers to check shops for unusual shrubs in B&Q and Lidl -again, as staff are mistakenly marking down rare species over fears they are sick.  Harry told The Sun : ""When we first saw the plant sitting there, we kind of just looked at each other and really couldn't believe what we were seeing.  ""It was reduced to Â£12 because it had a yellow leaf that B&Q must have assumed meant it was sick.  ""We hastily checked the stem for any colour, we then immediately just snatched it up and strapped it in the back seat with a seatbelt like it was our child.""  The couple had been searching stores for rare plants for their small business, The Plant Couple.  Harry reckons their plant is worth about Â£600 at the moment and says they'll sell the leaves at Â£170 each.  The couple say the plant would need to have elaborate multi-coloured leaves to be worth as much as Â£2,000.  To check whether your plant is rare or just has one yellow dry leaf, Harry recommends looking at the stem to see if this too is also yellow or white.  If the stem shows signs of striping, then it's variegated -which means showing different colours -and your plant could be worth a small fortune.  Even then, you have to wait until it has grown properly to make sure it isn't just a disease.  Harry says the chances of finding a super rare plant in a local shop can be ""extremely slim, one in a million"".  A B&Q spokesperson said: ""At B&Q we're pretty proud of the quality of our house plants so we can see why it's been reported that our plants could be worth up to Â£4,000.  ""Whilst we don't sell the extremely rare plants in question, we do sell top quality houseplants that our customers are more familiar with and that are more purse-friendly!""",0
Sultan â€˜partnerâ€™ joins will battle,"Index Sultan 'partner' joins will battle A WOMAN stated to be the de facto partner of late property mogul Ali Sultan has been drawn into a high-profile estate battle with his eldest son.  Moe Sultan is challenging his father's will in an ongoing Supreme Court of Tasmania clash, alleging executors and trustees of his father's most recent will misused money from the estate and appointed themselves directors of Sultan Holdings.  Rola Taychouri-Smith has recently been added as a defendant in the proceedings, with Moe Sultan noting various incarnations of his father's will since November 2018 granted her annual legacies and/or a specific bequest.  Moe Sultan says his father's last true will was made in July 2018 or earlier, and that subsequent versions did not represent his father's intentions and were not valid wills ""as he did not know and approve his contents"" when he executed them.  In her defence filed with the court, Ms Taychouri-Smith says she was the second cousin of Ali Sultan as her paternal grandmother was his maternal grandmother's sister.  But she also said she had been in a romantic relationship with Ali Sultan at the time of his death as his de facto spouse. She said that while Ali Sultan was married to Christine Sultan, their relationship ended in 2014 and they were ""in the final stage of formalising their divorce at the time the deceased died"".  She denied wills made in November 2018, November 2019 and December 2020 were invalid.  Ali Sultan, a well-known businessman, died unexpectedly in January 2021 after a heart attack while walking on kunanyi/Mt Wellington.  Moe Sultan claims his father had limited English skills, particularly in comprehension of written documents, and that newer versions of the will did not reflect his intentions. A number of defendants have already denied claims of wrongdoing in the case, including Integrity Commission chief commissioner Aziz Gregory Melick, Sultan Holdings accountant Mark Saltzman and lawyer Damian Egan.  Moe Sultan's younger brother Saleh, also listed as a defendant, has previously filed a written defence with the court, although the amended statement of claim does not allege any wrongdoing by him.  Two further defendants, Mezed Eid and Mohamad Eid, have now also filed a joint defence with the court, denying claims the later versions of Ali Sultan's will were not valid.  However, they agreed with Moe Sultan's claims that the December 2020 will did not represent Ali Sultan's testamentary intentions.  Two defendants - lawyer Ian Creese and Sultan Holdings project development manager Timothy Lucas - previously rescinded their involvement and are no longer parties to the dispute.  On Wednesday, lawyers for all parties involved appeared in the Supreme Court of Tasmania via video link before Associate Justice Stephen Holt. He ordered all defendants file affidavit material within 21 days, with a further directions hearing to be held on March 9. The matter is slated for mediation, and if it does not resolve will go to trial.",0

Virgin last week confirmed that it would raise prices by Â£56  a year for millions of customers.  The telecoms giant said almost all mobile, TV and broadband customers will be affected from March 1, 2022 -unless the household falls under the 'vulnerable' bracket.  After flagging the price hike on his ITV  show, Martin and his co-star Angelica Bell explained how one viewer has managed to make a huge saving by looking for a cheaper deal elsewhere.  The saver, known only as David, said: ""Thanks to watching the show, I rang Virgin.  ""They weren't able to beat a deal I had found elsewhere and so I've started the process of leaving them? for a deal that is Â£400 cheaper per year.  ""Plus the new deal has 2.5 times faster speeds!""  It isn't clear what type of deal David had with Virgin, or what new supplier he is switching over to.  But if you're coming out of your current broadband, phone or TV package, then it might be time to check if you can make savings too.  Have you managed to save money on your bills Let us know your story: mirror.money.saving@mirror.co.uk  How to save money on your bills  If you're out of contract, the first thing you should do is compare prices to see if you're getting the best deal.  You can compare prices using CompareTheMarket.com , Confused.com , MoneySupermarket.co.uk  or Uswitch.com .  If you do spot a better deal and you're out of contract, you should be able to switch providers for free.  But if you're still locked into a service or you don't want to leave your current provider, then you could try haggling.  Haggling is never guaranteed to always work, but if you do pull it off, you could end up making huge savings.  Start by calling up the customer service centre of your current broadband provider, and then give them details of the cheaper deal you've found -and ask if they can match it.  If they say they can't match it, you could try telling them you're thinking about disconnecting to see if that has any more sway.  Those who are still in contract and are desperate to leave should also check how much they'd have to pay to leave early, as you may still save money if the deal you've found elsewhere is massively cheaper.  For example, if you had to pay Â£50 to leave your current provider, but a new deal would save you Â£400 a year, it would be worth paying the exit fee.",0

This is because you could be deemed to be driving a car in a dangerous condition, if broken or blunt wiper blades stop you from clearing your windscreen properly.  If your wiper blades aren't working, then your visibility of the road could be affected while you're driving.  As well as risking a Â£2,500 fine, you could also see three points added to your driving licence, according to National Tyres and Autocare.  If the offence is committed within three years of a previous conviction for a similar offence, then you could be disqualified from driving for a minimum of six years.  Failure to have proper control of a vehicle or full view of the road and traffic ahead also carries a fine of Â£1,000 -or Â£2,500 for passenger-carrying or goods vehicles.  Section 40a of The Road Traffic Act: Using a Vehicle in a Dangerous Condition Part II, states that: ""A person is guilty of an offence if he uses, or causes or permits another to use, a motor vehicle or trailer on a road when the condition of the motor vehicle or trailer, or of its accessories or equipment is such that the use of the motor vehicle or trailer involves a danger of injury to any person.""

What cinemas will look like after lockdown -with special areas for social bubbles,"Money What cinemas will look like after lockdown -with special areas for social bubbles One of the UK's biggest cinema chains said it plans to reopen in July as Britain's entertainment sector gets back on track following months of lockdown  Cineworld is preparing to reopen all branches in England on July 10 with a new digital bookings system that will involve visitors checking in before attending viewings in person.  The chain, which was forced to close all 128 outlets on March 18, said it will be back in business next month, with the Government's new safety gudielines in place.  New measures will include 'updated seating maps' to space viewers out while all customers will have to book and confirm via a virtual bookings system.  In a statement, the world's second largest cinema group explained: ""We are excited to announce that we are planning to reopen Cineworld Cinemas across England on 10th July 2020.  ""The opening date is subject to final clarifications and confirmation in regards to UK government restrictions, with dates to follow for our cinemas in Scotland, Wales and Ireland.""  It comes as the lockdown was eased on Monday, allowing non-essential shops to open in England.  Under latest guidelines, drive-in cinemas can now reopen -though the Government has warned that indoor cinemas should not open until July 4 at the earliest.  Cineworld, which has 787 outlets globally, said there will be social distancing when stores reopen, with hand washing stations located throughout branches.  Tickets will be booked in advance on the company website or app -and confirmation emails will be sent in advance of bookings.  New seating maps will also be in place to ""allow friends and family to sit together while ensuring a safe distance between customers from different households"".  But the measures will vary based on the capacity and layout of each screen.  Film start and end times will be staggered to reduce customer interaction, while plastic screens will be placed at the till and PPE will be provided to employees, the company added.  Chief executive Mooky Greidinger said: ""We are thrilled to be back and encouraged by recent surveys that show that many people have missed going to the movie theatre.  ""With a strong slate confirmed for the coming weeks, including among others Tenet, Mulan, A Quiet Place Part II, Wonder Women 1984, Black Widow, Bond, Soul, Top Gun Maverick and many more, the entire Cineworld team remains committed to being ""the best place to watch a movie"".""  The company was unable to comment on how the lockdown will affect those on its Â£238 a year unlimited membership plan.  Major chains, including Odeon, Cineworld and Picturehouse, as well as BFI Southbank, the screening complex operated by the British Film Institute, announced they were closing their doors with immediate effect in March as the lockdown came into effect,  Vue, another of the UK's biggest cinema chains, has said it will reopen on July 4 if given the green light from ministers.",0

Sharia bank Al Rayan launches a 1.6% easy access account less than a week after Marcus disappointed savers,"Saving & banking Sharia bank Al Rayan launches a 1.6% easy access account less than a week after Marcus disappointed savers * Last week Marcus cut its rate to 1.45% ending its year-long reign at the top  * Following that easy access rates fell across the board  * However Al Rayan Bank has now launched a new top easy access rate  There's a new, and unusual, name at the top of the easy access savings tables.  Just one week on from Marcus Bank cutting its market-leading 1.5 per cent rate to 1.45 per cent and other providers following suit, leading to a gloomy outlook facing easy access savers, one bank has launched a rate higher than Marcus's in its prime.  Sharia bank Al Rayan has entered the easy access savings market for the first time, launching an account that pays 1.6 per cent, considerably higher than the next best offers from Cynergy Bank and Marcus.  The account can be opened online, by phone, or in the bank's branches in Birmingham, Bradford, Glasgow, Leicester, London, Luton or Manchester.  It is worth noting that Al Rayan is a Sharia-compliant bank, which means it cannot pay a guaranteed interest rate.  Instead it pays an expected profit rate, which can change the same way a variable interest rate on an easy access account can.  While this is the bank's first foray into the easy access market, it has offered an easy access cash Isa paying 1.35 per cent since April last year.  That rate nestles among the higher-paying easy access Isas in This is Money's tables, but is hardly a best buy and did not suggest the bank would be launching a rate which blew other providers out of the water.  However, in the fixed-rate market Al Rayan and fellow Sharia bank Gatehouse have consistently offered among the best rates. Right now Al Rayan offers the best rate in our tables on one, two and three year fixed-rate deposits, paying 2.07 per cent, 2.32 per cent and 2.42 per cent, respectively.  Given how Marcus helped drag up the rates offered by easy access accounts when it launched a year ago offering 1.5 per cent, there is a possibility Al Rayan has a similar effect if this account sticks around.  Anna Bowes, co-founder of website Savings Champion, said: 'It's an interesting move from a lesser known provider which has offered competitive rates on its fixed term bonds for quite some time now.  'But this is a competitive move into a new part of the market for Al Rayan. It's an excellent rate, especially under the current conditions and will be interesting to see if it causes other providers to up their game.'  Al Rayan allows account holders to deposit up to Â£1million into its easy access account, but only deposits up to Â£85,000 will be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.",0
Schiff Hardin Expands Estate Planning Practice With Ex-UBS Wealth Strategist,"In Brief Schiff Hardin Expands Estate Planning Practice With Ex-UBS Wealth Strategist Schiff Hardin is growing its estate planning practice, adding three attorneys in New York and Chicago, including Stephen Liss, a former UBS strategist who advised high-net-worth families.  Liss joined Schiff Hardin's New York office as a partner in its private clients, trust and estates practice group. The firm also announced Wednesday that Lisa Lukaszewski joined the firm's practice as counsel from Neal, Gerber & Eisenberg while Anna Luna joined as an associate from Ernst & Young. Both will be based in Chicago.  The trio's move comes as Schiff Hardin's revenue has dipped in recent years, according to ALM data. The firm said earlier this year that it was leaning into its trusts and estates practice, as well as other practices that other firms are overlooking.  Liss previously worked as a senior wealth strategist at UBS Financial Services and Barclays. Before that, he was a partner at Withers Bergman.  Schiff Hardin said that during his time in financial services, Liss helped domestic and international high-net-worth clients on income and estate tax planning matters, planned charitable giving and sophisticated life insurance structures.  Liss said that experience will help him as he transitions back into private practice and that he plans to use relationships he's cultivated through his years in financial services to grow his practice.  ""It will be nice to be able to see a project from inception to completion,"" he said in an interview, explaining that while at UBS and Barclays, he was a subjectmatter expert who taught clients about what options were available to them, but did not work with them from start to finish. Now, he hopes to bring his two expertise areas of law and financial planning together at Schiff Hardin.  ""I'm excited to use my experience to integrate legal and financial planning and explore how a financial planner can help a client,"" he said.  His decision to join Schiff Hardin was also influenced by relationships he already had with attorneys there.  ""I had worked with their lawyers before, and I had a really good sense of who did quality work based on what they actually produced, compared to who [in the legal industry] just talked about doing good work,"" he said, noting that a number of Schiff Hardin partners were certified by the American College of Trust and Estate Counsel.  ""This has been an important department for [the firm] for a long time,"" he said about Schiff Hardin's private clients, trust and estates practice group. ""They have a really supportive culture. They're just good, decent people, and I knew that coming in.""  In a statement, Thomas Abendroth, leader of the firm's private clients, trusts and estates practice, complimented Liss' combined experience in private practice and working directly with clients and advisers while at UBS. He said Liss has a ""strong background with counseling private clients and handling complex tax work from his years in private practice.""",0
Canada pension fund investment into US detention firm larger than reported,"World news Canada pension fund investment into US detention firm larger than reported CPPIB holds $6.1m in investments in Geo Group, a firm that runs US detention facilities under Trump's immigration crackdown  A controversial investment by one of Canada's biggest pension funds in a company which operates private prisons in the United States is larger than initially thought, recent securities filings have revealed.  The Guardian and Documented  reported last month that the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) - which manages $366.6bn in pension funds on behalf of some 20 million Canadian retirees - holds stock in Geo Group.  But the most recent regulatory filings show the CPPIB has added to its holdings in Geo Group by 90,000 shares since June - an increase of nearly 50% - bringing the total investment value to $6.1m. It is not known if the fund still holds the shares; the investment board did not respond to multiple requests for comment.  Facilities operated by Geo Group have been used in recent months to detain families in the United States, following Donald Trump's ""zero tolerance"" crackdown on immigration by the American government.  Meanwhile, the CPPIB decreased its holdings of CoreCivic, another private prison company, by 5,900 shares, valuing the investment at $1.65m at the time of filing.  The CPPIB is one of the largest funds in the world, and although the investments in American private prisons companies represent a narrow slice of the overall fund, they have prompted an angry reaction from campaign groups and politicians.  ""I'm very surprised to hear that number is significantly higher than we had previously thought,"" said Emma Pullman of SumOfUs, an advocacy group that started one of two online , an advocacy group that started one of two petitions     calling on the fund to divest its holdings. Between them, the two petitions have received more than 45,000 signatures.  Selling the investment would mark a significant move for the CPPIB, which prides itself in resisting external lobbying attempts.  But public outcry appears to have rattled the board. On 14 November, the board convened a meeting with activists from two separate groups, both petitioning the investment board to divest its holdings.  ""I think the reason they're looking into these options is because the writing is on the wall,"" said Logan McIntosh, a campaigner with the Leadnow advocacy group, who attended the meeting. ""It's an unnecessary and shameful investment and it's undermining the confidence of Canadians that they can manage our retirement savings responsibly.""  Every two years, the CPPIB hosts legally mandated presentations across the country to outline its investment strategy and allow the public to ask questions.  ""I don't think Canadians are interested in profiting from the abuse of humans and the caging of children,"" said Darcie Lanthier, a former financial advisor who attended one such event in Charlottetown. ""I know, with what little savings I have, I go out of my way to ensure my investments are doing no harm.""",0
Will Congress Update the Higher Education Act?(STATESTATS),"Will Congress Update the Higher Education Act?(STATESTATS) As debate continues over the PROSPER Act-the U.S. House GOP's proposal to revamp the country's higher education system--a bipartisan group of U.S. senators is working on its own plan. The Higher Education Act hasn't been updated in more than a decade, and many believe it's time for an overhaul. Changes are likely to affect the way students apply for financial aid and the way the federal aid system is structured. Although partisan politics exist in any policy debate, including this one, there appear to be several areas of shared concerns, including:  * The costs are too high for too many Americans.  * The federal student financial aid application is too long and complicated.  * Federal aid and repayments are confusing and don't cover job training programs and apprenticeships.  * Applicants for federal aid find out too late what they will be receiving to plan well.  --Magazine staff   Average Cost to Attend a Year of College or University, 2015                                     Public   Private nonprofit  On campus                          $23,300  $47,400 Off campus living with family      $14,100  $37,500 Off campus not living with family  $23,800  $46,900  Note: Table made from bar graph.

The act has been reauthorized eight times since 1965, the last time being in 2008.

"London stock market falls to 16-month low as trade war fears send the FTSE 100 index diving below 7,000","Money London stock market falls to 16-month low as trade war fears send the FTSE 100 index diving below 7,000 * The FTSE 100 index dropped 86.4 points or 1.2 per cent to close at 6,952.59  * Blue-chip index is back below the 7,000 mark for the first time since November 2016  * Traders spooked by threat of world trade war as President Tumpfirest first shot at China  * US markets open in the red; European markets 1.6-1.8 per cent down  The London stock market fell to a 16-month low today as world trade war fears prompted investors to hit the sell button.  Trading screens were a sea of red across Europe, as the FTSE 100 index dropped 86.4 points or 1.2 per cent to close at 6,952.59 - back below the 7,000 mark for the first time since November 2016.  A senior US official said today that the European Union and six other countries will be exempt from steel and aluminium tariffs announced by President Trump, at least temporarily.  But Robert Lighthizer's claim that President Trump had decided to 'pause' the import duties while further discussions took place could not assuage traders' concerns as Mr Trump prepared restrictions on Chinese investment and tariffs on nearly $50billion worth of Chinese imports.  According to the Press Association the move is to 'punish Beijing for stealing American technology and pressuring US companies to hand it over'.  China is already warning it will take 'all necessary measures' to defend itself, raising the prospect of a trade war between the world's two biggest economies.  Aside from the EU, Mr Lighthizer said Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and South Korea would be exempted from tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and 10 per cent on aluminium are due to come into effect on Friday.  The London market was already down when the US stock market opened sharply lower, which fed back to more selling in London.  American technology stocks slumped in the wake of Facebook's data privacy scandal, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq falling 87.81 points, or 1.2 per cent, to 7,257.47.  Facebook's share price continued to fall following weekend's news that Cambridge Analytica may have used data improperly obtained from roughly 50million Facebook users to try to sway US elections.  Today, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg broke the silence by apologising for the mistakes his company made in how it handled the data and promised tougher steps to restrict developers' access to such information.  'This was a major breach of trust. I'm really sorry this happened. We have a basic responsibility to protect people's data,' Zuckerberg told CNN.

CHANGING THE IMPOSSIBLE  ""Being the first at anything is pretty scary. It means you are setting the stage and foundation for those to come after you,"" Ms. Dorsainvil said. ""To the ladies in the audience who will also be the first at something, being the first means you look at the 10-letter word 'impossible' and change it to 'I'm possible.'""  Before the luncheon, the 2017 honorees joined honorees from 2015 and 2016 for a discussion on how to improve financial literacy for women of all ages. The goal was to identify some small changes that could make a difference in the world if embraced by many, such as introducing high school students to financial planning as a career opportunity.  Caitlyn Gimler, a student at Grand Valley State University in Michigan, told the group that a personal finance class at her high school, which was created thanks to a donation from Pershing CEO Mark Tibergien, helped inspire her to pursue a career in financial planning instead of law.  Ms. Gimler said that none of the girls at her high school had named finance or even business when asked what they wanted to do in life, and she thinks programs like Women to Watch could change that.  ""Having women in this career is really important,"" she said. ""It's up to us to do something about that. We have the resources to do it.""  Twitter: @ryanwneal",0
Draw up your will in a text message,"Sport Draw up your will in a text message Law Commission says 'outdated' system of inheritance must catch up with digital age  PEOPLE will be able to use voicemail and text messages to make their wills under a radical overhaul of inheritance laws proposed by the Government's legal advisers.  The Law Commission has branded the legacy system ""outdated"" and said it must keep up with the digital age.  Under laws which date back to 1839, wills need to be written and signed by the testator as well as two witnesses in order to be valid. The commission suggests those rules are unclear.  It has called for the law to be relaxed to allow notes, emails and voicemail messages to be used in place of a written will. Under its proposals, new powers would allow county and high court judges to decide ""on the balance of probabilities"" whether a recording or note is an accurate summary of a person's wishes. Deathbed changes of heart could be recorded and used to overrule an existing valid will.  The Commission has admitted that the proposals could add to family arguments. It said: ""A person who is seriously ill in hospital may have more immediate access to a tablet or smartphone than to a pen and paper, and may be more able to speak than to write. On the other hand, the potential recognition of electronic documents could provide a treasure trove for dissatisfied relatives.  ""They may be tempted to sift through a huge number of texts, emails and other records in order to find one that could be put forward as a will on the basis of a dispensing power.""  The powers already exist in Australia, Canada, South Africa and several American states.  Experts urged caution amid concerns older people could be pressured into last-minute changes. Caroline Abraham, Age UK charity director, said: ""Whilst we welcome this public consultation, any proposed changes must not create further barriers for people who wish to plan ahead, and ensure that older people are able to make their own decisions wherever possible, free from pressure and coercion.""  Elizabeth Neale, partner in the private wealth team at the law firm Bircham Dyson Bell, said that weakening the rules could have ""worrying"" implications for vulnerable people and there could be ""pressure on people to write something down or make a voicemail"".  Prof Nick Hopkins, a member of the Law Commission, said: ""Any new law would protect vulnerable testators against possible undue influence, and certainly if there was any suggestion that that had been exercised, the court isn't going to use the dispensing power. But this is a consultation, so if anyone has those concerns, they should let us know.""  The proposals also suggest changing the law about mental capacity to make it easier to assess whether someone with dementia is able to make a will and lowering the age someone can make a will from 18 to 16.  The consultation, which launches today, will run until Nov 10.",0
Pension fund moves into riskier investments; Venture Capital,"Financial Post Investing Pension fund moves into riskier investments; Venture Capital Frustrated by poor returns, OPTrust chief executive Hugh O'Reilly is moving into riskier investments as contributors to the retirement fund age.  ""We can't just match cash flows, we have to take risks,"" O'Reilly, whose company oversees $19.2 billion of investments for Ontario government workers, said in an interview. ""We don't want to increase contributions or reduce future benefit accruals where the active members will bear the whole risk.""  OPTrust is starting a $300-million venture-capital portfolio and is considering derivatives linked to insurance risk, O'Reilly said. The firm has allocated 1.5 per cent to these riskier assets and three per cent in hedge funds, though the latter is under review, O'Reilly said without elaborating. The fund more than doubled assets in hedge funds in 2016 compared with the previous year, according to the 2016 annual report.  ""We want to allocate relatively small amounts of capital into new and different investment areas,"" O'Reilly said. OPTrust will then ""see if they're viable, see if they make sense, see if we can incubate them and bring them back and put them where they best belong on the investment team.""  OPTrust, which manages pension assets for almost 90,000 former and current members of the Ontario Public Service Employees Union, generated a return on investment of six per cent for last year. That was down from eight per cent in 2015 and was less than half the 2016 return of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the country's largest pension plan.  ""Investment returns are unpredictable and can result in a wide range on any one-year basis,"" O'Reilly said. ""We know that our portfolio can deliver on our pension sustainability objectives over the long run.""  O'Reilly declined to say what OPTrust targets in returns, saying it is focused more on the amount of risk exposure it can tolerate.  The new venture-capital fund, known as the Incubation Portfolio, will target latestage startups that are mostly already profitable, O'Reilly said. Another large Canadian pension fund and a venturecapital firm, which he declined to name because the details are still being worked out, will help fund and guide some of the investments, he said. ""Venture capital is where the future is in terms of Canada, understanding risk and disruption,"" O'Reilly said. ""We're going to get active in this area.""  The strategy tweak comes as the number of workers that support the Torontobased fund is falling. Between 2007 and 2016, its retirees rose 60 per cent to more than 36,000, while its active members fell 8.7 per cent to almost 44,000, according to the pension fund.  The pension will keep outside management for most of its equity trading, some of it by RBC's PH&N Investment Services and Beutel, Goodman & Co., because of attractive pricing and the ability to learn from industry experts, O'Reilly said.",0
Bank of England tightens mortgage borrowing rules amid fears of debt boom,"Bank of England tightens mortgage borrowing rules amid fears of debt boom HOME buyers are set for stricter borrowing tests when they apply for the mortgage, amid alarm from Bank of England over easy loans amid record low interest rates.  GETTY  The Bank of England has expressed concern over household debts  Lenders will have to make sure that customers can manage repayments at a rate of around seven per cent - far higher than the rate they are likely to be applying for.  It means borrowers will only be able to qualify for a loan if they could afford bills at the higher rate, which is around three percentage points above the typical Standard Variable Rate ,  It comes as the Bank of England today warned in its bi-annual Financial Stability Report that credit card debt, personal loans and motor finance grew much faster than household income over the past 12 months. Related articles Tenant fees ARE a rip-off, says letting agent that welcomes ban POUND LIVE: Pound rises as Mark Carney updates on risks to economy  It has prompted concern that families have been encouraged to borrow by record low mortgage and credit card rates, but could struggle when interest rates start to rise.  The Bank of England said: ""As is often the case in a standard environment, there are pockets of risk that warrant vigilance.  ""Consumer credit has increased rapidly.  ""Lending conditions in the mortgage market are becoming easier.  ""Lenders may be placing undue weight on the recent performance of loans in benign conditions.""  Policymakers hope that clarifying lending rules will help prevent a banking crisis, like that seen in 2007, in the event of another economic downturn.The Bank said that lending rules ""will promote consistency across lenders in their application of tests to assess whether new mortgage borrowers can afford repayments"".

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney said lenders are now more vulnerable to risks from the rapid rise in consumer credit.  Stress tests on lenders relating to losses over consumer credit will also be brought forward.  Next month the the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority are to publish a report on the consumer credit market, which could impose tighter lending rules on firms, which will be supported by the Bank's Financial Policy Committee .  Joanna Elson OBE, chief executive of the Money Advice Trust, said: ""The Bank of England is right to take action to curb the huge growth in household borrowing we are seeing.  ""While most households can cope with this extra borrowing now, many risk finding themselves exposed to financial difficulty should their circumstances change.  ""In these uncertain economic times, the Bank's intervention to limit this risk is welcome.

"Online firm pairs home buyers, sellers with realtors","News Online firm pairs home buyers, sellers with realtors Lots of folks turn to online dating, using quizzes, photos and profiles to find a life partner.  So why not use that strategy for another big commitment - finding a realtor to buy or sell your home ? That ' s the rationale behind fivewalls (fivewalls. com) a new online business co-founded by a London entrepreneur that matches home buyers and sellers with a select group of experienced realtors.  The service is free to home buyers and sellers. They complete a quiz on the qualifications they want in their realtor, what kind of home they want to buy or sell, the location and price range.  Fivewalls comes back with a short list of realtor profiles, including a personal video produced by London-based Lemontree Photography. The profile lists the realtors ' recently sold homes, the number of transactions in the past year and total years of experience.  "" They can get to know an agent without taking a lot of time to meet them. They can review them at their leisure ,"" said Paul Hayman, who launched the business with a partner a year ago.  Since it was launched, fivewalls has signed up 400 realtors in London, Kitchener-Waterloo and Guelph and about 24,000 people have visited the website to search for an agent.  Fivewalls gets its revenue from member realtors by getting a slice of the commission when a home is sold.  Hayman said fivewalls is poised to jump into the Toronto-area market this spring.  Though he grew up in Belleville, Hayman has deep roots in London. His great-grandfather founded Hayman Construction.  Hayman graduated from Western University and has lived in London for 30 years. He served as entrepreneur-in-residence at Ivey Business School.  Hayman and some partners scored a success developing TFC (The Franchise Company) into a major corporation, selling out to the majority shareholder.  He later gained a background in housing, working with a Texasbased think-tank trying to deal with communities facing widespread vacancies after the housing crash in 2008.  Hayman formed fivewalls in partnership with Lee Piccoli, chief executive of Guelph-based Fusion Homes.  Home buyers and sellers often hooked up with agents by wordof-mouth or meetingthem at open houses, Hayman said.  But with the real estate market moving online, there was a need for people to research real estate agents online, along with homes, he said.  "" From the estimates we had, about 10 per cent of the market was already doing that and we thought we could build a business on that ."" More recent research shows 30 per cent of consumers are finding real estate agents online, Hayman said.  The London-St. Thomas real estate market has been hot for months and is on track to hit record sales this year.  But the downside for realtors is that competition for listings is intense.  Agents from major brokerages including ReMax, Royal LePage and Sutton Group have joined fivewalls, Hayman said.  / (See hardcopy for photo);",0
Bond fund warning as sell-off fears increase,"Business Bond fund warning as sell-off fears increase BONDS Savers may find they cannot withdraw cash if the market hits trouble, says James Connington  Turmoil in bond markets and a spike in the number of investors wanting to withdraw money ""raises questions"" about the suitability of popular bond funds, leading analysts have warned.  Bond funds - where savers' cash is pooled and then invested in loans issued by governments and companies - are among the most popular holdings in savers' Isas and pensions.  Many savers view them as a supposedly lower-risk source of income.  But analysts Manuel Arrive and Alastair Sewell of Fitch, the ratings agency, this week questioned whether these funds could withstand a rush to the exit by investors alarmed by a fall in bond prices. They have suggested some funds restrict withdrawals to weekly intervals.  They argue that while these funds allow withdrawals to be made on a daily basis, their managers may struggle to sell holdings quickly enough to be able to pay out.  One outcome could be the forced sale of holdings at poor prices into an already falling market. Another could be the decision by fund managers to temporarily restrict withdrawals.  The warnings are reminiscent of the difficulties facing commercial property funds earlier this year, when a sharp increase in withdrawals forced funds to stop dealing until they could raise cash by selling buildings.  With ""open ended"" funds, such as unit trusts, investors buy units. There is no limit to the number of units that can be issued.  When withdrawals occur, the fund needs to have the cash to meet them and the units are then cancelled.  If there is little or no market to sell holdings to at the time, managers can battle to put a value on the portfolio and individual units.  With property funds, this dilemma could be seen in the ""temporary value adjustments"" that applied to many over the summer.  Mr Arrive said: ""We haven't seen the same reaction from investors in bond funds as was seen in several UK property funds following the Brexit vote. Some fund types are going to be more exposed to liquidity risk if investor sentiment turns quickly.""  According to Fitch's report, the need to meet redemption requests at all times has pushed open-ended bond fund managers to maintain higher cash balances, hindering performance.  While Fitch acknowledged that managers have ""taken steps"" to better manage the risk posed by liquidity, the report claims ""there have been few evolutions in the redemption terms and conditions for open-ended funds"".  By comparison, investment trusts, or ""closed-ended"" funds have a natural release mechanism built in.  Investors buy shares in the investment company itself from a limited issue, and the share price can swing to a premium or a discount compared to the value of the underlying holdings.  In July, Muna Abu-Habsa, an analyst at investment data firm Morningstar, suggested that unit-trust type funds should be limited in the level of illiquid holdings they contain.",0
MARKET MOVERS THOMAS WELLS & PAUL PARASCANDALO,"Business MARKET MOVERS THOMAS WELLS & PAUL PARASCANDALO Thomas Wells and Paul Parascandalo are co-fund managers with Aviva Investors, which has Â£319bn (?363bn) of assets under management.  Their responsibilities include the Multi Asset Fund (MAF) Strategic, which is open to investors with a lump sum of at least ?5,400 or those who agree to invest ?100 a month.  Philosophy The MAF Strategic invests in a selection of different asset classes including cash, bonds, equities, property and alternatives such as commodities. It's designed for investors looking for a balanced mix between investments that offer potential for growth but are more defensive in nature.  ""We're trying to create an investment solution that ensures ongoing suitability for investors,"" said Wells. ""It's not just finding a solution that is appropriate for an investor at a single point in time, but one that is an appropriate solution on an ongoing basis.""  Performance The fund is up 3.4% over a year, while over three years the fund is up an average of 7.6% a year. The fund's five-year annualised return is 7.4%.  ""Last year was a challenging period but we invest for a three-year time horizon and on that basis our performance has been very good,"" said Wells.  Buying and selling The fund classifies its holdings under three broad categories: growth assets such as equities and high yield bonds; defensive assets which include government and investment grade bonds; and uncorrelated assets such as property.  The fund has recently taken profits on some of its growth asset holdings including North American, European and emerging market equities.  ""There's been a very strong rally in the last number of months so we took some money of the table,"" said Wells. ""We will go back in at more attractive levels if there is any sort of correction.""  Wells said that over the past nine months the fund had increased its holding of global high yielding bonds as well as emerging market currency bonds of countries such as Indonesia and South Africa.  ""These positions have done particularly well,"" he said. ""Performance of emerging market local currency debt has been in double digits.""  About 7% of the fund is currently held in cash, higher than its historical average. Wells, pictured, said it was part of the fund's current strategy of ""building up its dry powder"".  Outlook Wells sees a sustained period of volatility ahead but he believes markets will stay ""range bound"".  ""None of the sources of volatility such as fears over China, American interest rate hikes, or Brexit have left us,"" he said.  ""Markets are volatile and they're going to stay volatile.""  Wells intends to use any sell-offs to build on the fund's current strategy of holding income-paying assets.  ""If there are market corrections we will be adding risk and adding to emerging market debt local currency and global high yield. Given that we see markets are being range-bound, we want to build more income into the portfolio.""",0
Second Cup outlines 3-year turnaround plan amid $26.2M loss,"Investing Second Cup outlines 3-year turnaround plan amid $26.2M loss TORONTO - Second Cup Ltd. had a $26.2 million loss in the third quarter, as the embattled specialty coffee company booked provisions for cafe closures and the impairment of its asset values.  The loss amounted to $2.65 per share, mostly due to a $25.7-million item that reflects the reduced value of Second Cup's trademarks.  On an adjusted basis, Second Cup's operations had a reduced profit of four cents per share - down about 64% from last year's third quarter when adjusted earnings were 11 cents per share.  Second Cup also announced Monday that it plans to raise up to $5 million this month through a private placement of its stock, as part of a three-year plan to revitalize the Canadian specialty retailer's network of cafes and its brand.  At the end of the third quarter there were 349 Second Cup cafes, two less than a year earlier and eight fewer than at the beginning of the quarter.  Systemwide sales for the 13 weeks ended Sept. 27 fell about $1.3 million from a year earlier, dropping to $43.6 million from $44.9 million, but Second Cup's own revenue increased to nearly $6.7 million from just under $6.3 million.  Second Cup has been faced with increased competition in recent years from high-end coffee retailers such as Seattle-based Starbucks and major restaurant chains such as Tim Hortons and McDonald's.  The Mississauga-based franchise company has been working for months to recover its position in the Canadian market, hiring Alix Box - who has held senior positions at Holt Renfrew and Starbucks - as its chief executive in February.  ""Fiscal 2014 has been a year of transition,"" Box said in a statement Monday. ""While much remains to be done, we are now fully engaged in the process of transformation to restore Second Cup to a place of leadership and greater profitability.""  Following the end of the quarter, Second Cup announced its intention to acquire 16 cafes in Toronto locations from Debbie and Bob Riche, two long-time franchisees.  The company says it plans to open a new ""cafe of the future"" in Toronto and a flagship cafe in Montreal in the coming weeks.  In a related announcement Monday, the company said it's aiming to grow annualized system sales by about $50 million to $234 million in 2017, turn same-store sales positive by late 2015, and have earnings exceeding 50 to 60 cents per share by 2017.  ""Our plan for the future is ambitious,"" said Michael Bregman, Second Cup's chairman. ""While there are no assurances, our Board of Directors is highly confident that Second Cup will be restored to a position of leadership with significant potential for value creation.""  All the directors intend to participate in a stock issue, and collectively acquire between 40 and 60% of the $5 million worth of equity that Second Cup plans to offer.",0

Drive a hard bargain; HAVE PASSPORT WILL TRAVEL Jeremy Gates rounds up all the latest travel news,"Features Drive a hard bargain; HAVE PASSPORT WILL TRAVEL Jeremy Gates rounds up all the latest travel news TEMPERATURES are already falling in the Alps and if you want the price of your 2013/14 season ski holiday to fall too, driving to the slopes could be one easy solution.  With airlines ever-keen to slap hefty charges on extra baggage (something that is inevitable with a ski holiday) travelling by car could save families hundreds of pounds. Stuart McLeod of Zenith Holidays, an operator catering for 'savvy' skiers, explains: ""This winter, we are seeing a significant increase in the number of people driving families to the slopes to cut costs. If we include free Channel ferry crossings, driving down to the Alps saves about Â£450 for a family of four, as opposed to flying and paying extra on baggage at check-in.""  At lesser-known French resorts like St Jean Montclar and Les 7 Laux, for example, a family of four could enjoy a self-catering apartment with Channel crossings and lift pass from around a total Â£920 per week - or about Â£1,290 if they chose a four-star apartment with access to a pool (about Â£324 each).  McLeod says many skiers will also catch trains to the ski resorts this winter - some on Eurostar, and some catching trains direct to the Alps. These trains leave Paris at 10pm on Friday nights and arrive on the slopes next morning, allowing skiers to sleep on the train then grab an extra day's skiing on the Saturday, a day which would otherwise be lost waiting around at airports.  Of course, not everyone can face the long car or rail trek across France, especially if you live further north, and for this reason Monarch Airlines has flights of barely two hours from Manchester, Gatwick and various regional airports into Italy, Spain, Germany and Austria. Monarch one-way flights into Munich, from Leeds Bradford, Luton and Manchester start at Â£39.99 (Â£83.98 return) with transfers to the resort of Kitzbuhel taking 90 minutes. Fares to Grenoble, from Birmingham, Leeds Bradford, Gatwick and Manchester start at Â£44.99 one way (Â£91.98 return) with transfers of two hours and 45 minutes to Val d'Isere. There is more good news from the big operators too, keen to secure early sales at discounted prices to avoid the risk of bigger discounts nearer departure date. For example, Crystal Ski, which covers 136 ski resorts in Europe, North America, Japan and Russia with regional departures from all major UK airports, offers a 'buy one and get one half price' deal on lift passes - saving up to Â£177. It applies on bookings by October 21 for departures between January 4 and February 9.  Driving to your ski holiday can save you money.  At Ski Solutions, deals include savings on accommodation in Whistler, free lift passes and discounts in Verbier and four-night all-inclusive breaks at Isola 2000, from Â£575 includes return flights ex-Gatwick December 12.",0
A brighter future is now within reach; Workplace pensions Advertising Feature,"Features A brighter future is now within reach; Workplace pensions Advertising Feature LIFE is full of surprises, and here's one - you can improve your financial future without doing a thing!  Millions of working people are discovering the benefits of a workplace pension. This could include you if you're employed, aged 22 or over, and earn at least Â£9,440 a year.  The law has changed so your boss has to enrol you into a pension scheme automatically, without you doing a thing!  It's great news if you don't have a head for figures or worry about making the wrong choices with your money.  If you've never thought about having a workplace pension before, it might sound complicated.  But it's really a simple save-as-you-go system. Here's how it works: Your employer will write to you, so look out for this letter, which will give you more details about your workplace pension scheme and what it means for you.  Your boss will then automatically enrol you into the scheme. Once you've been enrolled, a small percentage of your salary will go straight into your pension pot.  Your boss will pay in as well - that's EXTRA money that you wouldn't otherwise get. The government will give you tax relief, too.  All three contributors - you, your employer and the government - will continue to pay into your pension pot regularly.  Your pot will grow over time and when you retire, you will be able to use it to buy a regular income for the rest of your life.  You will have the chance to opt out of your workplace pension, but, before you do, here are some things to think about: The current State Pension is Â£110.15 per week for a single person. It's a great foundation, but saving through a workplace pension will give you more money to spend in retirement.  Unlike other types of saving, you won't be the only person paying in. Your employer and the government will contribute too - that's not something you get with your ISA or savings account.  This isn't just happening to you - more than a million people have already been enrolled into a workplace pension in the past year. Don''t be the one to miss out!  This change started with the biggest companies first but will affect all businesses over the next few years.  Staying in a workplace pension could be the best decision you ever make. ?

New house sales build,"Property New house sales build Signs of growth in new housing sales have emerged in NSW and Western Australia, the states with the biggest house price gains.  Nationally, new housing sales rose 3.4Â per cent after a 4.7Â per cent decrease in July, the Housing Industry Association's seasonally adjusted figures, released on Tuesday, show.  However, new apartment sales fellÂ 11.2Â per cent across the country afterÂ new units sales eased in NSW andÂ Victoria.  ""It is no coincidence that the states where we've seen rises in new detached house sales are where we've seen the most price growth,"" HIA chief economist Harley Dale said.  New home sales were up 10.2Â per cent in August for Western Australia and 7.4Â per cent in NSW. South Australia also performed strongly, recording an 8.2Â per cent increase.  Dr Dale said recovery was under way in those two states but overall sales were trending sideways when SydneyÂ and Perth were not included in the figures.  In Queensland, where new house sales inched up at 3.6Â per cent, a housing recovery will not be as rapid.  ""It will be challenging and take time to gather momentum; it will be a grinding recovery in Queensland,"" he said.  In Victoria, new house sales fell 2.4Â per cent.  Dr Dale said he expected further declines this financial year, as the state was still coming off peak growth in new home and apartment sales in 2010.  Improvements in Sydney have been seen in the housing and apartment market. However, there were fewer new unit sales in August.  Across the industry, builders and developers have noted an overall improvement in sentiment and inquiryÂ levels.  Home builder Metricon chief executive Mario Biasin said sales had improved in NSW, Queensland and South Australia but off very low bases.High demand expected to continue  He said regional Victoria was performing well but metropolitan Melbourne remained quiet.  ""We're seeing more investors than first-home buyers at the moment, and people wanting to upgrade. More people are building now that they feel confident in selling their existing home,"" he said.  Years of under-supply in Sydney's land market, coupled with strong population growth and low interest rates, are fuelling the market.  Cameron Holt, chief executive of Investa's house and land arm, said the biggest challenge was maintaining the supply to the hungry Sydney market.  The unlisted land development arm of Investa Property Group has reported an increase in demand, particularly on Sydney's fringe.  Mr Holt said demand had been high over the past six months, and he expected that to continue.  Medium and high-density projects continue to sell strongly in Sydney, such as Australand's Metro project at Wolli Creek, where 55 of the 70 apartments sold at the September launch.

The ten-year Treasury note is up 14/32 in price to yield 2.594%, per Tradeweb data, and the 30-year bond is up 26/32 to yield 3.674%.  Of course, what everyone's really worried about is the upcoming debt-ceiling negotiations, and whether the government can patch up its current, comparatively minor problems in time to address this much bigger potential problem of causing the U.S. to default on its debt. Here's Deutsche Bank today:  On balance we expect moderate risk-off dynamics until resolution of both the budget impasse and the debt ceiling. The probability of even a technical default is extremely low, but the potential costs are very high. But in either event we expect the uncertainty to provide a short term tailwind to a consolidation of the summer's sell-off. We remain comfortable with our year end forecast for 2.5% Treasuries, but a more acute scare in the budget and debt ceiling process could push yields still lower in the short run.  And here's Peter Tchir of TF Market Advisors, underscoring what a calamity the debt-ceiling debacle would become if it led to a U.S. default by saying that it ain't gonna happen:  There will NOT be a default on U.S. Treasury debt. It won't happen because it has the potential to spin out of control. Even something that is ""technical"" and ""temporary"" could have ramifications for the market that no one will be willing to risk....  No matter what, we will pay our debts. Whether congress roles it weekly for a period of time, or we get a bigger solution, or the Treasury finds a way to pay people what is owed, the debt will be paid.  The potential consequences of not paying it are too great. It isn't simple and at some point the majority of politicians will listen to people like Bill Gross and understand that the dangers of not paying are just too stupid to take. The system is too complex and at its heart is the understanding that treasuries are highly rated and always pay. Breaking that taboo opens too many possible scenarios for no good reason. This is after all debt and payment obligations that we have encumbered ourselves with through law, and should be paid.  I would never bet against the incompetence of Congress, but I am willing to bet against them being completely idiotic and acting with gross negligence, which is what it would take to trigger default on Treasury bonds.

A fund of one,"A fund of one How one US pension plan is revising the definition of a 'commingled' fund to speed up investment  Finding ways of investing faster appears to be rife among US pension plans at the minute. Note last month's procedural shift by the Nebraska Investment Council, which removed the need for board approval for certain repeat commitments. The reasoning for the expedited process was to better enable the pension system to invest in vehicles prior to the first close, when better fees and terms are sometimes offered. If you ever wanted an indicator of how hot the US real estate market has become, measures likes these are surely one.  In addition, since the Nebraska case came to light, another one has cropped up. As PERE reported this week, the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA) has made a $100 million commitment to CityView Bay Area II.  This might seem like a run-of-the-mill commitment to a commingled fund. Indeed, that is what LACERA calls it. However, upon closer inspection, it much more closely resembles a separate account. There is only one limited partner, LACERA, and the pension plan has complete control over areas such as general partner termination, fund extensions and cessation of investment period. It also has retained the right to own the projects outright upon completion as long-term core assets and already has drawn up a true separate account management agreement with CityView to be used if and when it acquires full interests.  So, why hasn't LACERA just committed to a separate account rather than what it technically defines as commingled fund? The answer is the need for speed.  If LACERA had made this commitment as a separate account, it would first have had to go through a time-consuming request for proposal (RFP) process that typically requires six to nine months to complete. However, it doesn't want to miss out on opportunities now.  Still, there is no 'legal' definition for what constitutes a commingled fund. In addition, unlike some investors, LACERA does not have a limit on the percentage of a commingled fund that its investment can represent.  It's also important to note that not all state pension plans are subject to RFP processes for separate account managers or other real estate hires One large public pension that PERE spoke with has made its multiple separate account manager hires without putting mandates out for public bid. For LACERA, the need to engage in an RFP process becomes an additional hurdle and potentially puts it at a competitive disadvantage. This unique fund structure is one way for the pension plan to level the playing field without breaking the rules.  Of course, not all pension funds in the US will be following suit in finding ways to expedite the investment process. However, with the US market appearing so hot right now and investors not wishing to be too late to opportunities, one can expect more pension plans to find ways to be more nimble.",0
Certified COBRA Administrator COBRAGuard Inc. Awarded Contract with State of North Carolina,"Certified COBRA Administrator COBRAGuard Inc. Awarded Contract with State of North Carolina OVERLAND PARK, Kan., Sept. 17, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- After a transparent and highly competitive bid process, the North Carolina State Health Plan Board of Trustees awarded benefits administration contracts to five companies, including Kansas City-based COBRAGuard. The state provides benefits for approximately 664,000 people. With this decision, it expects to save $22.4 million, roughly 19 percent, compared to last year.  COBRAGuard will take over as the state's new COBRA administration partner effective July 1, 2013, and will serve for a contracted term of three and a half years. The company will provide a full range of COBRA administration and direct billing services. The contract is valued at approximately $1.2 million annually.  ""We are delighted to be chosen as North Carolina's COBRA administration partner,"" COBRAGuard President Robert Meyers said. ""Our goal is to help the state save time and operate efficiently, while delivering exceptional service and secure online account access for COBRA participants. The state was able to drive down costs by splitting the administration contract between several highly efficient, niche-focused companies. Other public entities should consider North Carolina's innovative strategy.""  COBRAGuard has a long history of successfully serving public entities. The company serves more than 1,000 cities, counties, municipalities, school districts and universities across the nation, with the addition of North Carolina. In 2011, the company announced the formation of a public entity division. Meyers serves as a councilman for the city of Roeland Park, Kan., so he has firsthand understanding of public entity challenges and a unique desire to help them thrive. ""At COBRAGuard, we don't see ourselves as vendors,"" Meyers said. ""We are highly engaged and adaptable problem solvers who extend the capabilities of the organizations we serve.""  Outsourcing benefit management is becoming more common, said Jan White, president of the Society for Human Resource Management of Greater Kansas City. White also is HR director for the Visiting Nurse Association of Kansas City. ""COBRA is just one of those regulations that a lot of people find cumbersome to manage, and if you can outsource it, that frees you up for other tasks,"" White said in the September 7 edition of the Kansas City Business Journal.  ""Public and private organizations understand that it's inefficient to continuously invest in the training, legal review and documentation needed to properly administer COBRA,"" Meyers said. ""It's considerably more cost-effective to outsource COBRA administration to experts -- particularly now that we're operating in the age of health care reform with a constantly evolving landscape.""

Grown-Up Spring Break Spots,"Spending Grown-Up Spring Break Spots Plane tickets might cost more this year, but if you're flexible on days (and not too picky about destinations), there are both spring break hotel bargains to be had - and strategies to avoid partying college students.  Airfare for between Feb. 28 and March 31 is up 9% this spring, to an average of $349, while hotels are down 15%, reports Bing Travel, Microsoft's travel search site. What does that mean for you? Think: travel jujitsu. ""College students tend to go to the same places every year -- Cancun, Palm Springs, South Beach,"" says Erik Torkells, the editor of travel review site TripAdvisor.com. ""They like to stay where all the action is."" For grown-ups, that might mean considering the Big Apple, where vacancies have brought down the prices on three and four star properties. Or a more family-oriented area, like Orlando. If you're really set on the beach, you could have to shell out for a high-end resort students can't afford, or head for hotels and vacation rentals at smaller towns nearby.  Here are three destinations for a bargain Spring Break:  1) Hawaii  Putting aside the recent tsunami scare, Hawaii is still a budget-buster for most college students because of the long-haul flight. But with peak travel season extending through April, there will be bargains - and crowds, says Barbara Messing, the vice president for deal-tracking site Travel-Ticker.com. Outrigger and Ohana resorts, which operate 23 properties on four islands, have dropped rates by up to 65% for travel through April 30. Prices for a standard room at the Ohana Waikiki West start at $79 per night. East Coast residents may be priced out, though: Round-trip flights from Los Angeles start at about $500.  2) Orlando  College students take over many of Florida's beaches, but the theme parks remain the domain of families, says Ian Ford, the founder of travel deal site UndercoverTourist.com. If you can avoid traveling in late March, early April over Easter weekend, there are deals on park properties, too. Disneycut room prices by 25% to 40% through March 27, and then starting up again April 11. You'll pay as little as $79 for a standard room. Round-trip flights from New York start at $175.  3) New York  New York came in third on student travel site StudentUniverse.com's tally of top spring break destinations, based on the number of flights booked. Tourists are unlikely to notice the influx, however, Torkells says. ""If students come to New York, the city absorbs them,"" he says. ""There isn't critical mass."" Expedia.com currently has discounts ranging from 20% to 40% on three- and four-star New York properties. A deluxe king room at The Alex costs as little as $209 per night instead of $349 (a 40% discount), while a superior king room at the Park Central New York Hotel is $179 instead of $239 (25%).",0
"New Book by Chicago Tax and Estate Planning AttorneysÂ Reveals Disastrous Tax Pitfalls ; Cut Your Tax in 2010, by Anthony Perrelli and Dean...","New Book by Chicago Tax and Estate Planning AttorneysÂ Reveals Disastrous Tax Pitfalls ; Cut Your Tax in 2010, by Anthony Perrelli and Dean Hedeker, Exposes How Poor Tax and Estate Planning Forces Many of Us to Pay Thousands More Than the Law Requires LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill. - (BUSINESS WIRE) - Cut Your Tax in 2010 (And Preserve Your Legacy) is released to major booksellers this week byNew Year Publishing. Cut Your Tax in 2010 (ISBN 978-1-9355470-5-1) provides the straight talk on how poor tax and retirement planning can cost your family dearly. The book is written by Chicago-area tax and estate planning attorneys Anthony R. Perrelli and Dean R. Hedeker.  ""Cut Your Tax in 2010 isn't about cheating the system,"" explains Perrelli.Â ""It's about avoiding mistakes on big taxes like estate and capital gains. Legacies are being lost by the second or third generation for no good reason.""  Cut Your Tax in 2010 covers how:  Personal and business assets can be protected in four smart steps. Capital gains taxes can ruin a family's legacy. An estate plan can save your family more than taxes.  ""Those working towards retirement have the most to gain with these insights,"" explains Hedeker. ""The book offers a way to start a dialogue between your own parents, spouse, and children - so that you can begin to work together to secure your family's financial future.""  The book tackles the current estate tax debacle in Congress as a major hot button for 2010. Hedeker and Perrelli point out that those with a decent amount of assets built up need to understand that:  The estate tax is currently scheduled to reappear in 2011, at only a $1 million exemption. Estates that escape a federal estate tax in 2010 may cause inheritors other tax headaches, particularly in capital gains taxes. Most states have their own estate or inheritance taxes. Illinois' estate tax kicks in at $2 million and that won't be changing anytime soon.  ""People thought that no estate tax in 2010 would make this the 'year to die,'"" says Perrelli. ""But it can be a nightmare because estates less than $3.5 million are now subjected to capital gains taxes instead.""  Cut Your Tax in 2010 is available atAmazon.comand other major booksellers.

ETFs Finish Flat in Light Year-End Trading,"Investing ETFs Finish Flat in Light Year-End Trading Stocks and exchange-traded funds hugged the flat line again Wednesday as investors were little motivated by better than expected manufacturing data.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 3 points at 10549. The S&P 500 climbed fractionally to finish the day at 1126, and the Nasdaq edged up 3 to 2291.The stagnation occurred despite a pop in the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, which rose to 60 this month, up from 56.1 in November. Expectations were for a nudge down to 55.1. A reading over 50 indicates growth.  In Washington, the government appears close to giving GMAC Financial Services another $3.5 billion in aid, in addition to the $12.5 its already put in since December 2008, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing an anonymous source.  Meanwhile, airlines and stocks overseas were hit hard early on concerns that Japanese Airlines' restructuring will involve bankruptcy.  The airline sector also faced more security worries, as President Obama said Wednesday that a ""systemic failure"" had occurred in the handling of information that could have prevented a Christmas Day terrorism attempt on a Northwest Airlines flight from Amsterdam to Detroit. OSI Systems, which makes security equipment for airlines, jumped more than 9%.  Most of the airlines rallied in afternoon trading and finished in the black.  Stocks overseas were higher. In Europe, the FTSE in London and Dax in Frankfurt were adding 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively. In Asia, the Nikkei in Japan was closed for the session while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 0.09%.

Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals,"Guardian Financial Pages Mortgage squeeze tightens after Abbey clamps down on interest-only deals Abbey today become the first major high street lender to clamp down on low-cost ""interest-only"" mortgages by reducing the maximum loan for such deals to as little as 50% of the property's value.  Growing numbers of borrowers have turned to interest-only loans as a way of affording high property prices. Customers pay interest but none of the capital debt.  In late 2006 the Financial Services Authority warned that thousands of homebuyers taking out these mortgages could be putting themselves at risk of repossession because they have little or no idea how they will pay back the loan.  Abbey said interest-only borrowers with ""a proven repayment vehicle in place"" would be able to borrow up to 75% of a property's value, down from 85%. Those who cannot produce evidence of a repayment vehicle will be limited to 50%. ""This reduces the risk to both the customer and to Abbey, and is prudent given ongoing market conditions,"" a bank spokesman said.  Nationwide yesterday increased the minimum deposit it demands from new borrowers to 10% on all but two of its mortgage products. Britain's biggest building society also halved its maximum loan to pounds 500,000, little more than two weeks after reducing it to pounds 1m.  Nationwide is the latest in a line of banks and building societies to rein in lending in response to the credit crunch. On Saturday Halifax increased some of its fixed and tracker mortgage rates by up to 0.6 of a percentage point.  Nationwide is reducing its maximum loan-to-value ratio from 95% to 90% on all products for new borrowers except its three-year fixed-rate mortgage and three- year tracker, both available to people looking to borrow 95% of a property's value.  Its move will fuel concern that 95% mortgages are under threat; Cheltenham & Gloucester, Alliance & Leicester and Britannia are among other lenders to have capped their maximum loans at 90%.  Halifax is one of the few lenders that still offers mortgages up to 95%, though it charges a higher rate for such loans.  Nationwide also said new customers wanting to take out its standard variable-rate deal, which it calls its ""base mortgage rate"", will need a deposit of at least 25%, and that this deal will be available only to customers dealing directly with it. It described the moves, which take effect from May 1, as ""part of its ongoing approach of managing business in a prudent and sustainable way"".  Sean Gardner, at personal finance website MoneyExpert.com, said the biggest struggle for buyers now was not being able to afford a mortgage but getting one. ""If you've not got a substantial deposit or equity in your house, then your choices are now severely limited. On average, if you are remortgaging you now need a deposit of 15.5% if you take out a fixed or variable mortgage.""",0

B. writes: I found an old Premium Bond certificate, but as I have moved home several times in recent years I would like to check that National Savings & Investments has my correct address. How do I do this?  A. M. replies: Write to NS&I with details of your name, holder's number, previous and current addresses and moving dates at: Premium Bonds, National Savings and Investments, Blackpool FY3 9YP. NS&I will also check whether you have any outstanding prizes due, but you can do this yourself online at nsandi.com/products/pb/ haveYouWon.jsp.  F. G. writes: My wife and I had to cancel our holiday as I fell ill just before we were due to go. Our travel insurer refuses to pay compensation as I cannot provide a doctor's note. Is there anything we can do?  P. D. replies: All travel insurance policies require you to provide satisfactory evidence in support of a claim. In cases such as yours, a doctor's note confirming you are too ill to travel is usually needed.  But it is not strictly necessary for this letter to be issued at the time you were ill. If your doctor was aware of the illness - perhaps you visited for medication or advice - you could ask the surgery to write a note today. This should refer to the original illness and state that you were unfit to travel.  Most insurers will consider your claim, even if the letter is written after the event.  But in the absence of a doctor's note, I am afraid you will not be able to claim.  T. K. writes: My mortgage deal ends next month and I will still owe Â£18,000, which I want to pay off as soon as possible.  The new mortgage deals from my existing provider look uncompetitive. Should I look elsewhere?  R. C. replies: Yes. Even though you want only an Â£18,000 mortgage, most lenders will consider this.  But if you do switch to a new lender, watch out for stinging legal fees and valuation costs and make sure to avoid deals with early repayment penalties.  As the loan amount is small and you plan to repay the debt as fast as you can, you might find your existing lender's standard variable rate - usually fee-free and penalty-free - works out cheapest, but there is no harm in shopping around.  When comparing deals, think about how quickly you intend to reduce your mortgage. Some lenders offer more flexible provisions for monthly overpayments or lump sum repayments.",0
No margin for error...,"No margin for error... OPES Prime investors appear to have a we problem.  Thats the stockbroking firm that went bust recently, owing more than $1 billion.  According to Sunday Times financial columnist Noel Whittaker, Opes clients took out an Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement (AMSLA).  It appears most thought they had regular margin loans, whereby the money borrowed to invest in assets was secured by the underlying investments. If their investments fell below a certain level in value, they would expect a margin call. This would signal they needed to top up their investment, which would remain their property.  But in the case of Opes, ultimately the lender actually owned the shares in this transaction. The purchase confirmation letters to clients, according to Whittaker, read We have bought for you...  In other words, we bought, we own. Or at least the ANZ bank did.  AMSLAs aside, Whittaker still has faith in margin lending, which he calls one of the best wealth-building strategies available.  But the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, Australias corporate, markets and financial services regulator, does not share his enthusiasm, noting:  Borrowing money to invest in shares and managed funds using a margin loan is one of the riskiest ways of financing your investments. It can succeed, but understand the risks.  The far shakier Opes with the de rigueur financier running funds in the Caymans and British Virgin Islands still had its champions, including WAs Olympic legend Herb Elliott, who appears to have lost more than $20 million.  The Fortescue Metals Group director was never beaten over a mile, and would probably like to have run a mile from Opes before the wee hit the fan.  We can sympathise to some extent, as human nature dictates that many of us will chase bigger than usual returns, even if they appear unrealistic.  But as Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens has noted of mortgage stress the logic can also be applied to other forms of investing particularly among the wealthier.  As you get more affluent, some of the necessities take up a smaller share of income and some of the things you really want take up a larger share, he said.  For those opting for a more expensive home: That is not stress, per se; that is a choice.  For the western suburbs, the messages are mixed. According to ABN Amro economist Kieran Davies, the prestige end of the property market the $5 million to $20 million bracket is thriving.  But property research group RP Data notes that the top end is likely to come under greater pressure if luxury homes cant be sold, particularly when the owner has a hefty share portfolio coupled with a frightening margin call or two.  It comes back to fundamentals, doesnt it? Allow a margin for error. Perhaps have another look at the fine print in your investment contracts.

SECOND-CHANCE INVESTING,"Smart Money SECOND-CHANCE INVESTING For the $3.4 billion Argo Investments fund, the latest stockmarket pullback is something to be taken in its stride.  The fund is the epitome of the long-term investor: it has been around for 60 years and makes many of its more recent competitors look like traders.  What is interesting about the market reaction to the reversal, says managing director Rob Patterson, who has been with the listed fund for more than 30 years, is the gloom and doom and confusion it appears to have created.  For Argo, the reversal, which has stripped three months of out-performance from the market, has presented the fund with an opportunity to top up its holdings of resources shares.  Patterson says investors need to remember that the correction has only taken the market back to the levels of March this year.  The rally and retreat since then, which has attracted a lot of noise, is something that could be history when company reporting begins in August.  Argo is a value investor, says Patterson, choosing shares on the basis of their scope to deliver higher profits and dividends.  It also emphasises diversification with a 180-stock portfolio, although Patterson says he'd like to reduce it to 150 holdings.  ""But it is not easy with the many new floats we've seen in recent times,"" he says.  Argo is a very long-term holder and rarely sells. Its biggest holding is an investment in Macquarie Bank that evolved from an interest in the unlisted Hill Samuel merchant bank that evolved into Macquarie. The holding represents about 7 per cent of the fund and is a legacy of not selling any investments just because they have made a profit.  Its other long-term investments are in BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto, along with the major banks and industrials such as Wesfarmers, Orica, AMP, Foster's and Westfield.  From an investor perspective, an attraction of Argo is its tiny annual fee of 0.25 per cent.  Patterson says Argo's value- focused approach made it a challenge to find new investments in the surging market.  Other commentators offered the following ideas to explore.  Stock Doctor's Elio D'Amato considers health-care company Ansell a good proposition based on its discounted price to earnings ratio, compared with its peers.  Services provider Count Financial gets a mention because it should benefit from the recent budget superannuation changes, plus the baby-boomer generation hitting 60 and needing more tax and investment advice.  Fat Prophets' Jason McIntosh says Lihir Gold is worth considering for those who missed the first gold-price surge.  The correction, he says, has given investors a second chance to get involved in an exciting gold play.  He also considers the correction to have provided a second chance to invest in top-tier miners and energy companies such as BHP Billiton and Woodside.  Commonwealth Securities strategist Charles Hyde says there is also value in BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto in the pullback.",0
COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes,"COMMENT: It's tough to justify 10-year fixes     Until lenders offer get out clauses so clients can switch out of 10- year fixed mortgages, longer term deals will remain a tough sell in terms of best advice, says Sally Laker      A couple of decades ago I would have given my right arm to have been able to fix my mortgage at 8%, let alone 5%. If it had been a 10-year deal even better. Why? Because interest rates were at 14%.      Luckily Bank of Scotland came to the rescue with what was called a stabiliser mortgage and this helped many a borrower survive. With this deal, the client agreed with the lender what rate they would pay. If interest rates went down they owed less and if they went up they owed more. An adjustment was then made to the loan after three years.      So what has all this got to do with fixed rates in today's marketplace? Well, it's a sign of the times. As I have mentioned, back in the late 1980s we would have done anything for a fixed rate and 8% would have been a steal but now things have changed so much that even a 10-year fixed rate at 4.99% will not necessarily fly out the door.      It seems crazy but we have become a nation of short-term fixers. We want two or three-year deals because we are ever optimistic that after two or three years the rates will be even lower. In reality this is unlikely to happen nowadays, but there will be a rate there or thereabouts.      So why not fix for longer and save switching every two years in hope of a better deal? In the case of best advice, it is a tough call to recommend a 10-year deal and effectively be sure that fix will be good for 10 years as well as proving that the client wouldn't be better off checking and switching every two years. Who can predict for certain that interest rates won't change much in 10 years, up or down?      Unless lenders can offer the equivalent of break clauses or get out clauses that allow borrowers to switch out of their fixes to other products during that 10-year period, longer term deals will be difficult to sell.      Nobody will want to pay hefty redemption penalties to switch even if it is to a more attractive product. Again, it is possible that many won't switch, but not having the option is a deterrent to even considering it.      We have become a nation of switchers. We switch credit cards, car insurance, house insurance - and now mortgages are seen as an extension of that.      This is all great news for brokers as it is their business to look after their clients and check their mortgages fit their requirements. And we know that those requirements can change in a two-year period - you only have to ask Tony Blair about that.",0
Offshore bonds better onshore counterparts bob goulding | Clerical Medical,"Supplement Offshore bonds better onshore counterparts bob goulding | Clerical Medical     Offshore bonds are beneficial for investors who have more than Â£250,000 to invest or are considered a non-domicile or non-resident for UK tax purposes.      According to Bob Golding, international planning manager at Clerical Medical, offshore bonds can outperform onshore on long-term investments of Â£250,000 or more, due to the compounding effect of gross roll up. However, he said it was necessary for clients to have a bond for at least 20 years to benefit from this.      For example, if a client invested Â£250,000 in an offshore bond and the same amount was put into an onshore bond, the offshore product would outperform the UK-domiciled bond after 20 years, if an 8% growth rate was assumed. After 30 years the offshore product would have grown to Â£1,100,000 compared to the onshore product with Â£1,000,000.      This takes into account both taxes and charges for the bonds. The onshore bond has been taxed 20% within the fund, while the offshore bond has had a 40% charge applied to the gains. However, Golding stressed that high-income earners could be taxed a further 20% on gains in an onshore bond.      As charges are also generally higher on offshore bonds, the final net return on smaller investments for shorter time scales does not make it worthwhile as the compounding effect of gross roll up does not have time to take effect, Golding explained.      However, he argued offshore bonds were beneficial for non-domiciles, non-UK residents and those absent for more than 182 days in one tax year.      He said gains on an offshore life policy could be reduced directly in proportion to the time the policyholder spent as a non-UK resident. For a non-domicile or a person not born in the UK, an offshore bond would be considered outside the scope of UK inheritance tax. According to Golding, there are around 60,000 non-domiciles in the UK, with this number steadily rising.      Offshore bonds also provide investors with a greater fund choice compared to onshore bonds, Golding pointed out. He explained: ""Permissible funds can include hedge funds as well as offshore deposit accounts. Also, if a client wanted to use discretionary management services this would also be allowed.""      The advantages of an onshore bond, Golding explained, included capital gains tax indexation and lower management charges which can be deducted from a fund's income for tax purposes.      Taxpayers who are on a low income when encashing the bond pay no further tax liability, while higher rate tax payers pay 36% once the initial 20% tax has been taken from within the fund. This compares to 40% tax on an offshore bond (see diagram above).      key points      Offshore bonds outperform onshore for investments other than Â£250,000 held for more than 20 years      Onshore bonds outperform offshore for smaller sums and shorter time scales      Offshore bonds beneficial for a non-resident and a non-domicile",0
Some banks offer reward points for debit card use,"MONEY Some banks offer reward points for debit card use     Credit card users have long enjoyed rewards for charging purchases, staying at certain hotels or flying on designated airlines. Now, as debit cards claim a rising share of electronic sales, more banks are offering points for debit card use, too.      Increasingly, debit card users are gaining points redeemable for plane tickets, merchandise or cash.      Last week, MasterCard joined with Upromise, an educational services company, to let banks deposit money into customers' college savings plans when they pay grocery, gas or restaurant bills with a debit card. This year, Washington Mutual introduced a debit card that gives customers 3 cents back for each purchase, up to $250 a year in rebates.      Citibank now awards customers points for using its bank products and services, including debit cards.      Bank of America offers to round up debit card users' purchases to the nearest dollar, then transfer that amount to a savings account.      Be aware, though: Debit card rewards tend to be leaner than credit card rewards. For example, banks generally offer one point for every $2 spent with a debit card, compared with one point for every $1 spent with a credit card, says Chris Allen of Dove Consulting.      If you're trying to earn a plasma TV or a vacation trip through debit card use, it'll generally take twice as long with a debit card as with a credit card. ""Banks are not going to be able to offer the same wham-bam experiential type of thing"" because they're not getting the finance or penalty charges they do from credit cards, says David Robertson of Nilson Report, a card industry newsletter.      Still, more banks are rolling out debit card rewards. In 2005, more than one-third of financial institutions gave rewards for debit card use, up from a fourth in 2003, Dove says. About a third of banks that don't offer such a program are considering it, the firm says.      The rewards are being offered as debit card use is rising. One third of retail purchases were made by debit cards in 2005, up from 26% in 2001, according to the American Bankers Association and Dove Consulting. During the same period, the percentage of retail purchases charged to credit cards fell slightly.      ""It's an evolution in the marketplace,"" says Stacey Pinkerd of Visa USA. ""Consumers are using (debit) cards like mad.""      Banks encourage customers to sign rather than enter personal identification numbers on debit card purchases because banks get higher fees for signature sales. If you sign for a $100 debit card purchase, the store will have to pay banks an average fee of $1.39, compared with 61 cents if you enter a PIN, the Nilson Report says.      These costs, though, are typically being passed on to people in the form of higher prices for products, notes J. Craig Shearman of the National Retail Federation.

Portman: Hasn't Received Any Takeover Approaches,"Portman: Hasn't Received Any Takeover Approaches     PERTH (Dow Jones)--Portman Ltd. (PMM.AU) said Monday that it hasn't had any approaches from Hong Kong's Mega Harvest Resources, despite media speculation that the iron ore miner is in the sights of Hong Kong businessman Lee Ming Tee.      ""There have been no discussions and no approaches at this point,"" Portman Managing Director Barry Eldridge told Dow Jones Newswires in an interview.      His comments follows confirmation earlier Monday that Mega Harvest Resources Ltd. has increased its stake in Portman to 7.48% from 6.65%.      Eldridge said that he does not know whether Lee Ming Tee is associated with Mega Harvest, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands.      ""We're in the process of trying to determine who the beneficial owners of Mega Harvest are and hopefully we'll get that in the next day or so,"" Eldridge said. [ 10-05-04 0451GMT ]      Portman hasn't appointed a corporate adviser, but is ""looking at our options"", Eldridge added.      A takeover offer from Mega Harvest is ""one possibility"", although Portman is not ruling out that the company may be a ""passive investor"", he said.      ""I don't know what their intentions are as I haven't spoken to them,"" he added.      An Australian newspaper report Monday said interests associated with Lee Ming Tee are planning a takeover move after becoming Portman's biggest stakeholder through recent share purchases.      Shares in Portman have risen by around 13% since mid-April, in defiance of downward pressure on mining shares caused by fears of an economic slowdown in China.      Portman is currently ramping up an expansion of its Koolyanobbing mine in Western Australia following long delays due to environmental restrictions.      The company is Australia's third biggest iron ore producer, but is much smaller than industry heavyweights Rio Tinto Plc (RIO) and BHP Billiton (BHP).      Portman sells around three quarters of its annual production in China and expects to produce more than five million metric tons of iron ore in 2004.      Late last month, Eldridge said he was comfortable the company will meet market profit forecasts for 2004.      Predictions from analysts are broadly between A$26 million and A$30 million, he noted. ""I'm comfortable with that range,"" he said.      Portman's marketing office in Beijing doesn't expect efforts in China to slow the local economy to have ""any impact on the demand for our iron ore,"" he added at the time.      At about 0500 GMT, Portman's shares were up two cents at A$1.63, off its intraday high of A$1.65. The company has a market capitalization of about A$280 million.      The substantial shareholder notice filed by Mega Harvest Resources said it now owned 12.82 million Portman shares, up from 11.40 million shares when the last notice was filed.

Harsco Had Expected To Contribute $24M To Pension In '04,"Harsco Had Expected To Contribute $24M To Pension In '04                WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Harsco Corp. (HSC) currently has about 36,600  asbestos personal injury claims pending, according to its quarterly report  filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission.          Included in the total, 26,650 cases were pending in the New York  Supreme Court for various counties in New York state, and 9,350 cases were  pending in state courts of various counties in Mississippi, the filing said.          The remaining claims are filed in various counties in several state  courts and in U.S. Federal District Court for the Eastern District of  Pennsylvania, the filing said. Those complaints assert lesser amounts of  damages than the New York cases, or they don't state any amount claimed,  according to the filing.          As of March 31, Harsco said, the company had obtained summary  judgment before trial or dismissal by stipulation in all cases that proceeded  to trial.          In addition, the company reached agreement with one plaintiff's  counsel in Mississippi to dismiss it from 2,900 cases in that state, the  filing said. Harso said it is awaiting entry by the Mississippi courts of the  appropriate orders of dismissal of those cases.          As reported, the court in New York County in December 2002 issued an  order creating a ""deferred docket"" for all pending and future asbestos claims  of plaintiffs that don't meet minimum criteria for discernible physical  impairment and an ""active docket"" for plaintiffs that are able to show such  medical conditions.          Harsco said the court made significant progress toward finalizing the  deferred docket for 1997 and 1998 cases.          As of March 31, the court has designated a total of 460 cases to the  active docket and assigned to trial groups scheduled for trial for the period  of February 2004 through February 2005, with the company named in only 164 of  those cases, the filing said.          Harsco also said that it was dismissed from all 14 cases that it was  named in the February 2004 trial group and is working to obtain dismissals  for all 28 of the cases that it was named in the May 2004 trial group.          The company said the lawsuits filed in the state courts of  counties in Mississippi were filed in the fourth quarter of 2002 before the  more restrictive ""deferred docket"" legislation took effect.           Also in the filing, Harsco said it expects to contribute a total of  about $19.8 million to its defined benefit pension plans in 2004, down from  its original estimate of $24 million.          In the first quarter ended March 31, the company said it contributed  $200,000 to its U.S. plans and $4.1 million to its international plans.          Harsco currently anticipates contributing an additional $1.2 million  for its U.S. plans and $14.3 million for international plans during the  remainder of 2004, the filing said.          Harsco is an industrial service and products company.    -By Chad Clinton; Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-1349;  chad.clinton@dowjones.com       [ 05-10-04 1336ET ]",0
Teachers blasts Caisse loophole,"Business Teachers blasts Caisse loophole     The Ontario Teachers Pension Plan Board said Monday that the exclusion of Caisse de dÃ©pÃ´t et placement du QuÃ©bec from Ottawa's recently proposed cap on pension funds' ability to invest in business trusts is ""unfair and discriminatory.""      Thanks to a tax-based loophole, Caisse - the largest pension fund manager in Canada with about $140-billion in assets - and the Quebec pension plans managed by it, are not subject to the investment limits announced by the federal government in the March budget. Pension funds can only place 1 per cent of their assets into a business income trust, and own no more than 5 per cent of any one trust.      Lee Fullerton, spokeswoman for the Teachers pension plan, Canada's second-largest pension fund, said that the proposed rules will put them at a competitive disadvantage by ""severely limiting our ability to make money for teachers. Caisse does not have that restriction placed on them.""      The new rules from Ottawa will have a significant impact on Teacher's holdings, which are above the newly-permitted limit, and will prevent the pension fund from fully participating in events such as income trust IPO's, Ms. Fullerton said.      ""We will be eliminated from many markets,"" she said. If this legislation goes through, Caisse and other pooled investments will have a ""tremendous competitive advantage competing for investments with all other Canadian pension plans.""      Teachers said it is talking with other pension plans to make sure they are aware of the inequality. It said it has also voiced its objections to the federal and provincial governments.      The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement Board (OMERS) told globeandmail.com last week that Caisse's exemption is ""unfair"" and said it is also discussing the issue with other pension plans.      The Caisse did not immediately return phone calls Monday.      Harry Adams, a spokesman for the federal government's Finance Department, said the Caisse is an ""agent of the Crown"" in Quebec, which makes it exempt from taxation and as wells as the proposed restrictions.      The only way the Caisse could be forced to comply with the new rules would be if the province of Quebec ""decided it wanted to do so itself,"" Mr. Adams said.      Income trusts, quickly approaching $90-billion in market capitalization, have become increasingly popular because of the steady stream of income they pay to investors and the advantages provided by their largely tax-free structure.      ""The proposed legislation is discriminatory against teachers and other members of Canadian pension plans,"" Ms. Fullerton said. Teachers, which invests $75-billion to cover pensions for 248,000 current and retired teachers, is an active player in the income trust sector.      The Caisse manages assets for more than 20 Quebec insurance and pension funds, including the Quebec Pension Plan and the Quebec Automobile Insurance Society. By exempting the Caisse from restrictions placed on the rest of Canada's pension funds, it allows billions of dollars to fall outside of the new rules.      Globe and Mail Update",0
"SL venture capital firm creates list of top tech, biotech leaders","SL venture capital firm creates list of top tech, biotech leaders     Salt Lake-based vSpring Capital last week unveiled the inaugural v|100, a peer-selected community of elite entrepreneurs based in Utah (or with significant ties to the state) deemed most likely to play an active role in building and growing successful technology or biotechnology companies in the next five to seven years.      Officially known as the vSpring Capital Top 100 Venture Entrepreneurs, the v|100 was conceived by vSpring as a tool to recognize the region's outstanding entrepreneurs and to support and promote collaborative partnering and mentoring among top entrepreneurs in the region. Although vSpring took initial steps to organize the v|100, the ongoing direction of the community will be determined by its members, as they have the opportunity to share their insights and opinions in shaping this unique community.      Organization of the v|100, began in late 2003 when leading members of the Utah business community were asked by vSpring to nominate the top 100 venture entrepreneurs based upon the following criteria:      * Individuals most likely to lead a successful venture in the next five to seven years in the information technology or biotech industries;      * Individuals who could be the CEO/CTO of a new venture; and      * Individuals with ties to the region (but not required to be Utah residents).      Entrepreneurs nominated then were contacted by vSpring and asked to participate in a confidential online survey to vote for the top 10 individuals each nominee felt would be the most likely to meet the same criteria, with the final tally generating the v|100.      Based on initial discussions with selected members of the v|100, vSpring has decided to build a private Web community accessible only to the v|100, that will allow and foster individual and group dialog between members and vSpring partners. Additionally, the v|100, will be invited to participate in a vSpringsponsored recognition lunch and golf tournament designed to kick off the group's inauguration and to further promote collaboration among v|100, members. They will also be invited to participate in ongoing, executive-level roundtables and will continue to help identify and recognize Utah's often overlooked populous of successful executives and managers.      Not surprisingly, more than 90 percent of the members of the inaugural v|100, live in Utah. Additionally, these individuals have raised more than $1.8 billion in capital and formed companies leading to the creation of more than 7,000 jobs. The vast majority (more than 70 percent) has founded Utah-based businesses during the past 10 years.      A complete list of the v|100, can be found at    www.vspring.com.      vSpring is an early-stage venture capital fund focusing on investment opportunities in information technology and life sciences. vSpring capitalizes on the managerial skills and operating experience of its principals to successfully invest in and mentor early-stage companies. vSpring has offices in Salt Lake City and Los Alamos, N.M.

(HPC) expects capital  expenditures in 2005 to be $70 million to $75 million, according to its  annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.            As reported, the maker of chemical specialties said 2004 capital  expenditures are seen at $65 million to $70 million.            In the 10-K from late Monday, Hercules said capital expenditures are  expected to be about $60 million in the years 2006 through 2008.         [ 03-16-04 0859ET ]                 According to the 10-K, Hercules projects asbestos settlement payments  of $40 million to $45 million in 2004 before consideration of any insurance  coverage or reimbursement.            Net of insurance, Hercules spent $40 million during 2003, the filing  said.            Hercules said it expects severance payments of $10 million in 2004.  Restructuring and severance payments were $21 million in 2003 versus $39  million in 2002, according to the 10-K.            Hercules also said it expects remaining tax payments from its  BetzDearborn divestiture to be between $11 million and $21 million, and  expects to pay them in 2005.            In April 2002, Hercules completed the sale of its BetzDearborn water  treatment business for $1.8 billion in cash, resulting in net after-tax  proceeds of $1.7 billion.            In 2003, Hercules paid $15 million in taxes related to the  divestiture.         [ 03-16-04 0926ET ]                 Hercules said in the filing that it expects pension and  postretirement benefit plan expenses of $58 million for 2004, $73 million for  2005 and $63 million for 2006.            The company said it made contributions of $55 million to its defined  benefits pensions plans in 2003.            Hercules said the projected increase in pension expense in 2004, 2005  and 2006 is because of the decline in interest rates and the unfavorable  performance of the company's pension investment portfolio from 2000 to 2002.            Hercules said a projected decrease in pension expense in 2006 versus  2005 results from favorable investment performance in 2003.            As previously disclosed, Hercules said it expects making voluntary  cash contributions of $40 million a year to its benefit plan over the next  few years.            Hercules said in the 10-K it contributed $40 million to its U.S.  benefit plan in January and $7 million to its non-U.S. pension plans in the  fourth quarter of 2003.         [ 03-16-04 1003ET ]                 In the 10-K, Hercules also disclosed that it repurchased 46,000 of  its CRESTS Units for $34 million in the fourth quarter, of which $27 million  was the units' preferred security component and $7 million its warrants  component.            Also in the fourth quarter, Hercules purchased $24 million of its  11.125% senior notes, recognizing a loss of $5 million.

Mad Cow Disease Risk Sparks Call For Wider Import Ban,"News And Features   Mad Cow Disease Risk Sparks Call For Wider Import Ban   Australia should immediately ban imports of cattle, beef and beef products    from countries at risk of developing cases of mad cow disease, including Asia, a University of New England academic has warned.    Professor John Nolan also said a database of cattle semen and embryos should be established with the capability of tracing progeny, as the lethal Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) continues its spread through Europe.    The calls, to be made tomorrow at the biennial University of New England conference on recent advances in animal nutrition, come as the Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA) finalises its new certification process aimed at blocking any imported beef or beef products not scientifically proven to be BSE-free.    In the meantime, Australia continues to import beef products from Asia. This    is despite a ban since January on beef and beef products from 30 European countries, and the four-year ban on anything containing British beef.    Potentially BSE-infected meat-and-bonemeal protein supplements have been exported from Britain and Europe to Asia and elsewhere over the past decade. An ANZFA spokeswoman said beef imports from overseas ``total about 2 per cent of our total consumption''.    ``Certification, when it is announced later this month, will have a number of    categories and will place a worldwide ban on beef imports to Australia unless exporters can provide absolute proof of no BSE infection,'' she said.    The new categories will range from the BSE-free status given to Australia, New Zealand and nine other countries, through Asian and other countries which are at risk but have no known cases, to the other extreme    the countries including Britain and France with active BSE cases.    Already well established in western Europe, the first case of BSE in the Czech Republic was detected last month, and another, two weeks ago, became the first detected case in Greece.    After years of claiming to be a BSE oasis in Europe, Germany has detected more than 40 cases since late last year and is exporting beef to North Korea. BSE has an incubation period of up to five years.    Professor Nolan, from the animal science group of the UNE's school of rural science and natural resources, will argue that last year's decision by Australian quarantine authorities to relax importation restrictions on embryos and semen from cattle and sheep    some from countries that have had cases of BSE and its sheep equivalent, scrapie should be closely monitored.    And if the potential risk is deemed sufficient to warrant it, Professor Nolan    also suggests implementing random sampling and testing of the 23 million general cattle population.    Australia excludes live animal imports from all countries except the United States, Canada and New Caledonia, but cannot trace 24 of about 400 cattle and buffalo imported from Europe before 1989. Professor Nolan will also suggest at the conference an on-going review of the feeding of animal protein to non-ruminant livestock (pigs, chickens, even fish).",0
Pension off AVC rules; The Last Word,"Pension off AVC rules; The Last Word     THE Government must review the rules governing top-up occupational pension schemes without delay.      Additional voluntary contributions, or AVCs, look hopelessly out-of-date when compared with the brash new stakeholder pensions being launched next week.      AVCs are used by millions to increase their occupational pensions. They have served their purpose well, especially where employers have subsidised the charges.      But their weakness has been exposed in recent months. They are too inflexible because savers are often restricted in their choice of investment, and it is very difficult to move money once it is committed to a particular fund.      And the tax rules are too restrictive. It is quite simply unacceptable that savers who choose stakeholder pensions can take a quarter of their fund as a tax-free lump sum while most of those who have started AVCs since April 1987 cannot take a single penny tax-free.      If AVCs are to survive, then their rules must be brought into line with stakeholder. This means allowing savers to take a tax-free lump sum. It also means providing more flexible access to pensions and breaking the link between the mainstream company scheme and AVCs.      People should be allowed to draw their AVC pension separately from their mainstream occupational pension, making phased retirement simpler. Currently the only way to do this is by using income drawdown, which is too risky for all but the wealthiest people.      They should also be allowed to move their AVC savings independently if they are not happy with the investment performance of the fund. Until now AVCs have had a clear playing field, with expensive free-standing AVCs as their main opposition.      But the world has moved on, and the Government must make it possible for AVC schemes to compete. Otherwise they will look increasingly unattractive and their days could be numbered.      * SAVERS using with-profits schemes are being bludgeoned again. This time, some insurance companies are using obscure penalties called market value adjusters (MVAs) to reduce payments to people forced to cash in their savings policies or bonds early.      Money Mail has warned about MVAs for many years, but the insurance industry has consistently played down the threat of them being used.      With-profits are supposed to smooth returns, keeping money in reserve through good years so payments won't have to be cut in bad ones.      Well, it appears that this rule no longer applies, at least for those who need to cash in early or wish to transfer their savings.      Insurance companies will argue that the stock market falls mean savers cashing in early could be taking an unfair slice of the investment cake.      But if with-profits policies can no longer smooth returns then investors would be better off with unit trusts and similar investment funds where they can see what their savings are worth on a daily basis, rather than having their returns decided on the whim of an actuary.      t.hazell@dailymail.co.uk      943259710",0
"Gold Stocks Favoured As Telecom, Bank Shares Fall","Business; Money Market And Share Market Gold Stocks Favoured As Telecom, Bank Shares Fall Investors sought the safety of gold stocks and bonds yesterday, as concerns about the economy weighed on investor sentiment.  The All Ordinaries index fell 12.5 points to 3276.9, hurt by sharp falls in the influential telecom and the banking sectors.  Even the diversified resources sector, strong during the week due to the dollar's slump and offshore buying, dropped back as investors took profits.  Gold performed well on the day, boosted by a strong performance in overseas stocks and strength in the gold spot price.  Leading the ASX200 higher in percentage terms was Lihir Gold, up 4c to 68c, after a number of analysts returned from a mine site visit earlier in the week and updated recommendations.  Bullish research from UBS Warburg said the investment bank retained the view that Lihir was a world-class gold asset which was improving operational efficiency and benefiting from the improving price of gold.  Other strong gold stocksincluded Goldfields, up 7c to $1.55, Anglogold, $2.70 to $65.50, and Delta, up 5c to $1.32.  Werrie Gold was suspended as speculation continued that an extraordinary meeting will be called to seek approval for a share placement at 50c a share, followed by an acquisition. There was also talk, dealers said, of a deal with AOL Time Warner and a further capital raising at $1 a share.  Telstra led the drop in the telecom sector as investors banked profits amid political uncertainty and dealers described busy options activity. Telstra shed 11c to $6.59 with 15 million shares traded. Optus was off 7c at $3.80, Macquarie Telecom was down 5c to 40c and Open Telecommunications shed 6c to $1.06.  Advertising group Singleton slipped 1c to $3.86 after market sources said the company was raising about $25 million via a placement through Wilson HTM at about $3.50 a share. The funds will be used partly as working capital and partly to cover the partial selldown of shares by managing director Mr Russell Tate.  Media stocks were weaker amid fears the slowdown would weigh on advertising revenue. Fairfax fell 18c to $3.74 and PBL 39c to $11.81. News Corp gained 25c to $17.42 after Wall Street's strong run. Overnight, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 128.6 points to 10,858.25.  FACT FILE  Telstra leads telecoms and the All Ords lower as extent of the economic downturn weighs on sentiment.  Gold stronger; the sector's safe-haven status attracts active buying.  Bonds also popular; the yield in the benchmark 10-year issue falls 7 points to 5.1pc a two-year low.

Wall of silence over 'flexible' Abbey fund,"Wall of silence over 'flexible' Abbey fund     HOW would you feel if you had saved for retirement in a personal pension, but then faced paying a penalty of up to half the fund's value for moving it elsewhere?      That is what happened to Ahmad Salam, an investment banker, who took out a personal pension with Abbey Life.      He was sold the policy by an Abbey salesman in 1994, but had to stop contributing to it two and-a-half years later when he started a new job with a company that offered an in-house pension scheme.      Ahmad, 40, from Putney, south-west London, thought there would be no problem stopping contributions and leaving the money with Abbey Life, or transferring it elsewhere. He recalls: 'When I took out my pension, I told the salesman that I changed jobs every couple of years and needed a flexible pension just in case I moved again.' The salesman seemed to have found him the perfect solution.      In a letter to Ahmad, he said the pension would remain 'very flexible to contributions as you and I will review [it] at least once a year to take account of changing circumstances'.      But when Ahmad moved jobs and wanted to stop payments, Abbey said it would charge him 3.5 per cent of the fund value a year on top of existing plan charges to leave the money where it was, or a hefty penalty that would reduce the fund value from Pounds 18,500 to a transfer value of Pounds 9,500 if he wanted to move it.      In desperation, Ahmad contacted an independent financial adviser, Peter French of London-based Troy French and Partners, who negotiated a 'substantial reduction' in charges if the money stayed with Abbey.      But last year, Ahmad's work circumstances changed once more and he thought again about transferring his pension elsewhere.      About the same time, Abbey wrote saying its funds had become 'closed' to new business and it would not be taking on new clients. So he could not get advice from its salesforce.      Allied Dunbar was taking over the salesforce, but it, too, could not advise him. Instead, Abbey recommended on the phone that he consult an independent adviser at his own expense.      Ahmad is angry. He says: 'I have been left high and dry. No one is interested in me. Abbey has my money and that is all it's bothered about.'      French believes Abbey has let down its pension policyholders. He says: 'These customers have already paid for ongoing advice in the form of up-front commissions on their pensions, but they are not getting it. They are left between a rock and a hard place over whether to pay a large penalty to move elsewhere, or a smaller one annually by leaving the money in a closed fund.'      Abbey Life spokesman Robin Giles says the company has no plans to review charges on its policies, but says that Scottish Widows now runs its funds.      943767724",0

Advisors tend to leave the more detailed estate-planning conversations to the lawyers that draw up wills and power of attorney documents. However, those advisors who are looking to add value should also ensure their clientÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s estate plans are up to date. Advisors are particularly well positioned to pick up on changes that should be made to an estate plan or the potential gaps within one given their financial oversight role For example if clients say they re going through a divorce or having a baby advisors could remind them that changes may be required in their wills Some clients may not even have a will which an advisor could suss out in the conversation Every advisor has a responsibility to be an educator and pick up on some of those red flags in conversations with clients says Karen Tzupa a financial planning specialist in Saskatoon Too often people fail to update their documents when there are those significant changes in their financial situations It s really about listening and picking up on those cues Here are five often overlooked items in an estate plan of which advisors should be aware Personal loans It s not unusual for parents to lend their adult children money without expecting it to be paid back The loan could become an issue though when the last surviving parent passes away and the executor uncovers the liability in the estate The question is whether the loan is to be forgiven or comes out of that child s share of the estate Ms Tzupa says The answer depends on the family but needs to be clarified in the will which doesn t happen often creating unnecessary friction when it comes time to distribute the assets It s a matter of open dialogue and being clear in discussion with family or even in a will Ms Tzupa says Taxes on registered investments When someone dies his or her estate is responsible for paying the taxes on registered plans such as a registered retirement savings plan RRSP or a registered retirement income fund Too often people don t consider the tax implications of registered investments when aiming to distribute their assets among beneficiaries evenly says Elizabeth Dorsch chief executive of BMO Trust Co and head of estate and trust services at BMO Private Banking in Toronto That s because the beneficiary who is given the registered plans may receive more than those who receive a distribution from the estate as taxes for a registered plan are paid by the estate and are not deducted from the RRSP All of a sudden you have an unequal distribution which wasn t the original intent Ms Dorsch says People think they re doing the right thing but it s actually hurting someone To avoid this scenario she recommends that any registered plans should be distributed equally in the will separate from other assets Shipping costs for inherited physical assets When leaving physical items such as furniture or art to beneficiaries who pays for the cost to ship it to the new owners If the will doesn t make reference to it the beneficiary is responsible for the fees says Ms Dorsch Those costs can really add up if the beneficiary lives in another province or country The issue can be solved by putting instructions in the will to say the shipping costs will be covered by the estate It comes up all the time says Ms Dorsch When we do our will plans we put in a statement that says To be delivered which removes the ambiguity Wills can also be specific about covering other costs such as travel fees for children to attend the funeral especially if they live in another county If it s silent then it s up to the person to cover the costs Ms Dorsch says Sometimes those costs can be quite substantial Outdated or uninformed executor Most people name an executor such as a spouse or family member in their wills to handle the estate when they die In some cases people forget to update their executor when their circumstances change For example someone who names his or her spouse as an executor may forget to change that after a divorce It s important to update an estate plan to ensure the executor is still the best person for the job says David Lee a financial advisor with BlueShore Financial in North Vancouver People should also check to see if the person they designate wants to be the executor Mr Lee says he s come across many people who find out after someone has died that they ve been named the executor of the deceased s estate Being an executor comes with a lot of responsibility Mr Lee says Leaving that to someone could require them to spend a lot of time settling the estate Is the individual the right person to take care of that task He recommends clients review their estate plans every three to five years to ensure the information is still accurate and as desired including the named executor Digital assets More of our lives have moved online which means a growing list of digital assets to keep track of When we pass away executors will need to access many of these online assets which includes everything from cryptocurrencies to accounts on eBay PayPal loyalty reward programs and social media websites Although most people don t see these online items as assets overlooking digital assets in estate planning can be a hassle for executors power of attorneys and beneficiaries Your executor needs to be able to access those accounts Ms Tzupa says And if they can t it can slow things down when it comes to the administration of the estate

"Small potatoes. That phlegmatic verdict on the share market reversals of the past few days from Bill Dudley, president of the New York Federal Reserve, seems about right. Wall Street's two daily dives of more than 1,000 points apiece last Monday and Thursday might sound alarming, but in percentage terms they were really quite modest. The entire drop in the Dow Jones industrial average from its January 26 peak to Friday's close is only 9 per cent. It merely takes us back to the level of last November.
Yet that doesn't mean that shares, both in the United States and closer to home, can't fall a whole lot further. The market's obsesssion with shortterm volatility might seem a bit esoteric to buy-and-hold investors hoping for a decent retirement income in a few decades' time.

FORGET THE VISITORS' CONDO, BUILD RESPS FOR KIDS, ADD LIFE INSURANCE, BUILD UP TFSAs In British Columbia a couple we ll call Harry and Wendy have a thriving life They have two children the eldest is two and the other just a few months old jobs that produce a combined take home income and pretax universal child care benefits of a month or a month after tax bringing their takehome income to a month They do scientific work for the provincial government and have defined benefits at retirement Yet they have financial assets of just which at their ages is modest Wendy expects a windfall payment from a labour agreement Even with that their resources for raising their children will be strained At present they put just a month into their children s Registered Education Savings Plans nothing into their RRSPs and into their Tax Free Savings Accounts less than half their allowable amount and just an eighth of what they might use to fill their space They have not made wills or appointed guardians for their children We work hard to be debt free to put sweat equity into our home and to buy with cash rather than credit Harry explains Early retirement say is our goal They want to buy a condo for the children s grandparents to use when they are in town and to rent out at other times But does buying a second property make sense and they wonder what would its effect be on other goals such as funding the kids educations and their own retirement Family Finance asked Derek Moran head of Smarter Financial Planning Ltd in Kelowna B C to work with Harry and Wendy PRESENT FINANCES Harry and Wendy will have solid definedbenefit pensions if they stick with their jobs until retirement But age is not likely to work Moran says They owe about on their present per cent mortgage It won t be paid off until when Harry is Their children s RESP has a balance of just It is underfunded even for the two year old who has of contribution room plus potential Canada Education Savings Grant allowance of per child per year before age The parents hold in cash THE KIDS NEEDS Simple things first put into the RESP to fill the existing space for the two children and add the CESG of per cent of contributions or If the parents add per year for the next years until the eldest child is when the CESG stops and for two years until the younger child is then at three per cent growth for the period the fund will have when the younger is Two more years of growth for a year for two years would add If the funds are split each child would have about for post secondary education enough to cover tuition anywhere in Canada and all bills for tuition room and board anywhere in B C They should also buy year term life insurance for to a year total for both parents In a decade rates would rise but the period of need would be shorter RETIREMENT FINANCES The windfall is really a wage settlement and will be subject to tax at Wendy s rate per cent so that she will net If that money is directed to the mortgage it will reduce total interest payable over the life of the debt by and the amortization will be cut by months Their retirement funds are likely to be just job pensions Their present jobs provide pension contributions so their RRSP space is drastically reduced by the pension adjustment Given their other needs they can just forget about adding to their RRSPs Over time they can direct money now going to child care to their TFSA Their children s needs will grow and it is unlikely that Harry and Wendy will have much surplus before they reach retirement age If Harry works to he would get a job pension of a month plus a bridge of to That s a year before tax If Wendy works to her age she would get a month plus a monthly bridge to total a month or a year Their total income would be If Harry who immigrated to Canada at age works full time to age he will have years of maximum Canada Pension Plan credits or per cent of the CPP maximum annual benefit in That would give him a year Wendy will have years of CPP credits If she qualifies for per cent of the maximum benefit she would receive about a year at rates Harry will have years as a resident of Canada at age when he is eligible for Old Age Security assuming the OAS qualification age reverts and holds at His benefit will therefore be about a year Wendy will get the full annual OAS payment in Adding up their pension components to age Harry would have a year from his job pension and Wendy would have a year from her pension for total annual income of At Harry could get from CPP and a year later Wendy would get from CPP Each at could receive OAS but they would lose their combined monthly bridges of a month or a year Their total permanent income at and after would therefore be before tax With age credits and pension splits to average income they would pay average tax of per cent and have a month to spend Their present expenses a month would drop in retirement when they eliminate commuting costs childcare and TFSA contributions leaving of monthly expenses Their retirement incomes would cover their bills Retirement before would mean a combined loss of or from their job pensions They can t afford that much of a shortfall Their present budget does not allow for purchasing another condo They have no money for a down payment Assuming that they could borrow for a condo after making a per cent down payment their monthly payment would be for years The mortgage would be paid in years into a retirement beginning at when income would have dropped It s not feasible Moran says I think the couple will do well and that their children can have their post secondary educations funded Moran says But buying another condo or adding heavily to any other expenses is not possible It is not a priority and it

Within the cash trust industry, some cash management trusts let interest rates do the talking while others woo customers with more user-friendly features. Almost all offer chequebook facilities and the internet is just a few keystrokes away from becoming standard practice. A CMT is a unit trust or managed investment in which money from investors is pooled to buy a range of short term money market investments Unlike a cash management account offered by banks building societies and credit unions a CMT is governed by a trust deed that sets out how the trust will operate and the rights and duties of the manager and trustee Another difference is the tiered interest rate structure offered by a CMA which means they are better suited to amounts greater than To court customers institutions are constantly polishing their products and new players are venturing into the fray NRMA Cash Management Account has attracted million since its launch last November The CMA has a chequebook an optional Visa access card and no regular account keeping or management fees Salary and share dividends can be paid directly into the account and deposits can be made by telephone The AMP cash management trust which was established in and has attracted more than million has introduced a chequebook to match its competitors Already withdrawals can be made by telephone fax and the internet to a nominated bank account The minimum amount to open a CMT varies from AMP s to Macquarie Investment Management s the minimum withdrawal by cheque is usually between and Cheques below this amount may incur a penalty although a few allow three free cheques a month below With the NRMA s CMA the first six withdrawals each month are free with a fee of for subsequent withdrawals A minimum of is required to open the account According to Tony Lally general manager retail business Common wealth Financial Services its CMT has grown in the past two and a half years from million under management to billion It is one of the few CMTs without a chequebook facility Our CMT is a short term at call account used by customers who want their money to work harder for them in a low interest environment We don t have a chequebook because we don t regard it as a transaction account Money can be transferred into a cheque account so we don t see the need to duplicate Customers can initiate transactions by phone using a pin number We are not yet on the internet for transactions but that will come as we work through the security aspects We also have some other plans to make it more user friendly by making it far more electronically driven and less people driven BT Funds Management describes its CMT as a plain vanilla product but the topping is its interest rate per cent for the past year to January current rate is per cent Terry Power executive vice president says the average profile of a CMT holder is a BT investor who may use the account to accumulate dividends from shares or distributions They tend to use it as an account for cash which is set aside but not used for day to day living The average balances tend to be fairly high We have looked at adding a number of bells and whistles but have decided that the impact on performance would not warrant it Macquarie Investment Management will have internet access for its CMT the biggest unit trust in Australia within the next six months The CMT s odd investors have deposited almost billion Division director Robyn FitzRoy describes its CMT as the smart bank account an effective and cheaper alternative to a standard account I think CMTs are going to be the big battleground of the future she says referring to the billion stashed in CMTs at the end of September last The secret is to run a small transaction account for day to day expenses and keep most of the cash in a cash management trust The question is which one because they are not all the same Macquarie s tends to be viewed as a working investment account with cash withdrawals via telephone cheque or a linked AMEX card Investors can also deposit cheques for the CMT at any National Australia Bank branch The average balance is more than People can use it for their business some companies use it for the liquid cash component of their super fund because you get a relatively poor deal with a standard bank account As for small business where they are driven by cash each day our CMT is not the best thing for them because we don t deal in cash But another benefit of the CMT is the consolidated statement which shows all your dividend investments so it helps you manage the whole investment process It is the hub ANZ V Plus available through an intermediary such as your accountant or solicitor is described as a money market investment similar to a CMT The telephone based account which has attracted billion has a flat interest rate of about per cent There are no limits on the number of cheques but withdrawals must be more than When it comes to cash management accounts HongKong Bank has won the Personal Investment gold award for the past two years Called the HongKong Bank Call Deposit it has a tiered interest rate ranging from per cent for balances between and to per cent for more than Tailored to those with high net worth the CMA

Security beneficiaries can be eligible for a benefit Children up to age or up to age if they are full time students who haven t graduated from high school and disabled children older than may be able to receive up to half of a parent s Social Security benefit SEE ALSO QUIZ How Well Do You Know Social Security How Benefits Are Factored To be eligible for Social Security benefits you must earn at least credits You can earn up to four credits a year so it takes ten years of work to qualify for Social Security In you must earn to get one Social Security work credit and to get the maximum four credits for the year Your benefit is based on the years in which you earned the most money If you have fewer than years of earnings each year with no earnings will be factored in at zero You can increase your benefit by replacing those zero years say by working longer even if it s just part time But don t worry no low earning year will replace a higher earning year The benefit isn t based on consecutive years of work but the highest earning years So if you decide to phase into retirement by going part time you won t affect your benefit at all if you have years of higher earnings But if you make more money your benefit will be adjusted upward even if you are still working while taking your benefit There is a maximum benefit amount you can receive though it depends on the age you retire For someone at full retirement age in the maximum monthly benefit is You can estimate your own benefit by using Social Security s online Retirement Estimator COLA Isn t Just a Soft Drink One of the most attractive features of Social Security benefits is that every year the government adjusts the benefit for inflation Known as a cost of living adjustment or COLA this inflation protection can help you keep up with rising living expenses during retirement The COLA which is automatic is quite valuable buying inflation protection on a private annuity can cost a pretty penny Because the COLA is calculated based on changes in a federal consumer price index the size of the COLA depends largely on broad inflation levels determined by the government For example in beneficiaries received a generous COLA of But retirees learned a hard lesson in and when prices stagnated as a result of the recession There was no COLA in either of those years For the COLA came back at but dropped to less than in the next few years But bad news came again this year Prices were flat and thus there was no COLA for The COLA for the following year is announced in October SEE ALSO Delaying Social Benefits Boosts the Value of COLAs The Extra Benefit of Being a Spouse Marriage brings couples an advantage when it comes to Social Security Namely one spouse can take what s called a spousal benefit worth up to of the other spouse s benefit Put simply if your benefit is worth but your spouse s is only worth your spouse can switch to a spousal benefit worth bringing in more in income per month The calculation changes however if benefits are claimed before full retirement age If you claim your spousal benefit before your full retirement age you won t get the full If you take your own benefit early and then later switch to a spousal benefit your spousal benefit will still be reduced Note that you cannot apply for a spousal benefit until your spouse has applied for his or her own benefit Income for Survivors If your spouse dies before you you can take a so called survivor benefit If you are at full retirement age that benefit is worth of what your spouse was receiving at the time of his or her death or of what your spouse would have been eligible to receive if he or she hadn t yet taken benefits A widow or widower can start taking a survivor benefit at age but the benefit will be reduced because it s taken before full retirement age If you remarry before age you cannot get a survivor benefit But if you remarry after age you may be eligible to receive a survivor benefit based on your former spouse s earnings record Eligible children can also receive a survivor benefit worth up to of the deceased s benefit SEE ALSO How Spouses Can Maximize Social Security Benefits Divorce a Spouse Not the Benefit What if you were married but your spouse is now an ex spouse Just because you re divorced doesn t mean you ve lost the ability to get a benefit based on your former spouse s earnings record You can still qualify to receive a benefit based on his or her record if you were married at least ten years you are or older and single Like a regular spousal benefit you can get up to of an ex spouse s benefit less if you claim before full retirement age And the beauty of it is that your ex never needs to know because you apply for the benefit directly through the Social Security Administration Taking a benefit on your ex s record has no effect on his or her benefit or the benefit of your ex s new spouse And unlike a regular spousal benefit if your ex qualifies for benefits but has yet to apply you can still take a benefit on the ex s record if you have been divorced for at least two years Note Ex spouses can also take a survivor benefit if their ex has died first and like any survivor benefit it will be worth of what the ex spouse received If you remarry after age you will still be eligible for the survivor benefit It Can Pay to Delay Once you hit full retirement age you can choose to wait to take your benefit There s a big bonus to delaying your claim your benefit will grow by a year up until age Any cost of living adjustments will be included too so you don t forgo those by waiting While a spousal benefit doesn t include delayed retirement credits the survivor benefit does By waiting to take his benefit a high earning husband for example can ensure that his low earning wife will receive a much higher benefit in the event he dies before her That extra of income could make a big difference for a widow whose household is down to one Social Security benefit In some cases a spouse who is delaying his benefit but still wants to bring some Social Security income into the household can restrict his application to a spousal benefit only To use this strategy the spouse restricting his or her application must be at full retirement age and he or she must have been born on January or earlier So the lower earning spouse say the wife applies for benefits on her own record The husband then applies for a spousal benefit only and he receives half of his wife s benefit while his own benefit continues to grow When he s he can switch to his own higher benefit Exes at full retirement age who were born on January or earlier can use the same strategy they can apply to restrict their application to a spousal benefit and let their own benefit grow SEE ALSO Mind the Gap If You Delay Social Security Take a Do Over There aren t many times in life you can take a mulligan But Social Security offers you the chance for a do over Say you claimed your benefit but now wish you had waited to take it Within the first months of claiming benefits you can withdraw the application You will need to pay back all the benefits you received including any spousal benefits based on your record But you can later restart your benefit at a higher amount Early claimers have another opportunity for a do over They can choose to suspend their benefit at full retirement age Say you took your benefit at age Once you turn you can suspend your benefit You don t have to pay back what you have received and your benefit will earn delayed retirement credits of a year Wait to restart your benefit at age and your monthly payment will get a boost which could erase much of the reduction from claiming early Uncle Sam Wants His Take Most people know that you pay tax into the Social Security Trust Fund but did you know that you may also have to pay tax on your Social Security benefits once you start receiving them Benefits lost their tax free status in and the income thresholds for triggering tax on benefits haven t been increased since then As a result it doesn t take a lot of income for your benefits to be pinched by Uncle Sam For example a married couple with a combined income of more than may have to pay income tax on up to of their benefits Higher earners may have to pay income tax on up to of their benefits SEE ALSO Taxes on Social Security Can Be a Costly Retirement Surprise Passing the Earnings Test Bringing in too much money can cost you if you take Social Security benefits early while you are still working With what is commonly known as the earnings test you will forfeit in benefits for every you make over the earnings limit which in is Once you are past full retirement age the earnings test disappears and you can make as much money as you want with no impact on benefits But the good news is that any benefits forfeited because earnings exceed the limits are not lost forever At full retirement age the Social Security Administration will refigure your benefits going forward to take into account benefits lost to the test For example if you claim benefits at and over the next four years lose one full year of benefits to the earnings test at age your benefits will be recomputed and increased as if you had taken benefits three years early instead of four That basically means the lifetime reduction in benefits would be rather than Copyright The Kiplinger Washington Editors",0

An annuity allows people to get hold of their hard-earned retirement savings in a responsible way. It converts your pension pot into a carefully calculated annual income that should comfortably last the rest of your life However this product available direct from pension providers or online brokers has often been accused of offering poor value for money particularly when bought without financial advice or by people in poor health Critics say it is all too easy to be lulled into uncompetitive rates if you fail to shop around depriving you of income that is particularly precious if do not have long to live Retirees have previously had no ability to trade in annuities or substitute them for a different product That is all changing following George Osborne s pensions revolution of Now the Government is giving people even greater freedoms with plans to establish a secondary annuities market SAM Due to be launched on April next year SAM will enable people to cash in their annuities in exchange for a lump sum to spend or invest how they see fit HMRC is now in the process of ironing out tax implications after launching a consultation predicting that people could take up this option Meanwhile the Financial Conduct Authority has published its own blueprint for SAM but with a warning that sellers could be exposed to significant risks Indeed experts have voiced their own misgivings arguing that SAM could be just as much of a minefield as the first hand annuities industry Tom McPhail head of retirement policy at Hargreaves Lansdown says There are still unanswered questions around the regulation of the market and how consumer protection could work we need to make sure investors don t end up getting ripped off by their insurance company for some of them possibly not for the first time Andrew Tully at Retirement Advantage says that customers with very small annuities may find a capital lump sum more appealing than a small monthly income but warns that SAM will be a complicated market He goes on We need to ensure people who currently receive poor value annuities do not think the secondary market is their means of escape Two wrongs will clearly not make it right trading your annuity is not the panacea for the lack of shopping around at retirement So how will SAM work Broadly speaking sellers can hand over their annuities to a third party an authorised broker in return for a lump sum or to buy a flexi access drawdown fund or flexible annuity The requirement to take financial advice is likely to be mandatory above a certain threshold and the customer will have to go through a new underwriting process to check health and lifestyle Mr Tully says The buyer for your annuity will consider your current health and how long they think you will live This may be different to when you originally bought the annuity if your health has since deteriorated and you will probably need to complete a medical questionnaire This will all help the buyer work out how much income they think is left from your annuity and therefore the value they will place on it Of course these things aren t cheap and there will likely be substantial costs for doing a deal He cites the costs for a medical administration possible advice and the need for the buyer to make a profit although commission will not be charged The biggest stumbling block could be tax this is payable on the cash lump sum which will be considered as part of your normal income and calculated at your income tax rate This reduces what you get from the deal and may even push you into the higher tax bracket per cent Indeed the Treasury has estimated it will make million from tax receipts in the first two years of SAM You need to be hard headed about how you will manage your pension if you trade in your annuity The SAM option may be viable if you have other sources of income such as multiple pensions or dividends from your investment portfolio much less so if you are completely reliant on your annuity Plus you cannot go back once you trade in your annuity meaning you have to be certain it is the right deal for you and you may also give up the right to transfer your annuity income to your spouse if you pass away If you do decide to cash in Steven Cameron from Edinburgh based pensions firm Aegon recommends seeking professional advice or at the very least shopping around to get the best deal He also suggests flexible drawdown as a less drastic alternative to a lump sum You can then take an income when you wish and only pay income tax on the amount you take out often cutting your tax bill",0

GM intends to offer lump sums to a portion of their salaried retirees while purchasing annuities for other retirees who do not receive a lump sum offer or who choose not to elect a lump sum With an annuity purchase all of the liability for covered retirees is transferred to an insurer These actions will remove the obligations for most salaried retirees from GM s balance sheet The combination of tactics and scale of planned actions are unprecedented in the U S private defined benefit pension market commented Matt Herrmann leader of Towers Watson s Retirement Risk Management group GM s announcement follows Ford Motor Company s recent decision to offer lump sums to substantially all former employees by the end of In both cases the planned actions are designed to transfer pension liabilities for employees who have previously left the organization often referred to as legacy obligations The recent announcements by GM and Ford symbolize a major shift in corporate pension perspective as companies seek to reduce their ongoing financial and administrative burden of obligations for former employees said Carl Hess global head of Towers Watson Investment Services Improved pricing coupled with continued market uncertainty and increased desire to focus on core operations may result in additional companies exploring these types of actions GM s move comes shortly after their February announcement that they will freeze all future benefits for their current salaried workforce Settlement of legacy liabilities is not confined to frozen plans said Herrmann Companies sponsoring ongoing plans are also exploring these tactics to help manage the size of their plans and facilitate the continued delivery of defined benefit programs Lump sum offers for retirees and annuity purchases of this magnitude are groundbreaking events in the evolution of risk management strategies As history suggests major market shifts are often driven by the actions of the largest corporate plan sponsors concluded Hess About Towers Watson Towers Watson NYSE NASDAQ TW is a leading global professional services company that helps organizations improve performance through effective people risk and financial management The company offers solutions in the areas of employee benefits talent management rewards and risk and capital management Towers Watson has associates around the world and is located on the web at towerswatson com CONTACT Towers Watson Ed Emerman eemerman eaglepr com or Binoli Savani binoli savani towerswatson com SOURCE Towers Watson Copyright Business Wire Order free Annual Report for Towers Watson Co Visit http djnweurope ar wilink com ticker US or call END Dow Jones Newswires June ET GMT",0

The UK was hotter than Athens, Barcelona and Istanbul last week, so thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no better time for a lovely bucket and spade British beach holiday. The question is, do you need insurance if you are staycationing? Most assume not because there is no risk of unexpected medical expenses but there are a few reasons you might want to consider it if you have booked a particularly expensive summer break If you have an annual travel insurance policy check whether it covers you if your holiday does not include a trip overseas Not all insurers will cover you in the UK but those that do will cover you for unexpected cancellations LV an insurer says that it paid out in claims for UK trips last year with cancellations making up the bulk of its compensation at an average of per family If you have to cancel your UK break because you or a close family member falls ill for example you should be able to claim the costs back which is more than worth it if you ve booked a pricey cottage for a fortnight Watch out for the insurance exclusions under which a company will not pay for example if you knew a family member had a pre existing condition or a family member is not considered a close enough relative Also be aware that if you are travelling in a big group all adults must have their own insurance policy even if only one of you paid the bill If you are taking children on holiday who do not live with you stepchildren grandchildren or friends of the family for example you will not be covered under a family insurance policy This applies here or overseas Cancellation cover should also pay out if you cannot make your transport with trains often being more expensive than flights A return ticket from Stansted to Ibiza or Slovenia at the end of June was significantly cheaper than a train from London to Newcastle or Buxton according to the travel gift company Flightgiftcard There is small print to watch out for Some insurers do not cover internal flights so you may not get a payout if you are jetting off to Newquay or Glasgow According to Defaqto the data company most annual travel insurance policies will cover you only if you are away for a minimum number of nights usually two sometimes three which can mean that weekend breaks are not covered You can t say you were planning to go away but felt unwell so didn t book anything you have to show intent to travel and that you have booked accommodation says Brian Brown of Defaqto You may also need to staycation a reasonable distance away from your home Most insurers specify that your holiday must be more than miles from where you live and most expect you to be put up in a hotel not by family or friends If you are taking valuables such as a bike laptop camera or family collection of smartphones check whether you are covered on your home contents insurance or whether it is cheaper to claim on travel insurance if you lose them or have anything stolen Contents insurance does not always automatically cover items that you take outside the home and you may prefer to make a claim on your travel insurance so that you do not lose your no claims bonus Also watch out for high excess the payment you have to make on a claim because it will reduce how much you receive from the insurer Which the consumer group says that while you generally do not need to pay to insure yourself against illness or injury on your British holiday thanks to the NHS Jersey Guernsey Sark and the Isle of Man fall outside the EU and the NHS remit Your European Health Insurance Card is not valid on any of the Channel Islands and you may be stung with a massive bill should you need to be flown back to the mainland for any medical treatment",0
"Mark Twain: Buy land. They're not making any more of it.
Real estate expert Morris Mostowyk: Don't!","Mark Twain: Buy land. They're not making any more of it.
Real estate expert Morris Mostowyk: Don't! The manager of the Royal LePage Commercial Real Estate Fund RLCREF has sunk his clients million in something safer than undeveloped acreage professionally managed prime commercial real estate the intrinsic value of which doesn t fluctuate wildly with every market hiccup Solid and stolid Mostowyk who holds both a commercial broker s and securities licence shies away from volatile investments He makes no promises of double or triple digit returns But the year veteran with Royal LePage can provide long term peace of mind In when more speculative funds were nose diving into negative growth RLCREF had a respectable return of per cent Of that per cent was rental income from the fund s five properties and the balance appreciation Even during the worst years of the recession in and we were distributing to per cent in income he notes Although that profit was offset on paper by shrinking appraisal values depreciation passed through to unit holders shelters part of the income and after tax yield is high For someone in a per cent tax bracket the effective tax rate would have been about per cent last year Launched in with a trust indenture limited to Canada and excluding relatively risky investments in apartment buildings hotels and raw land RLCREF is the country s only generally available no load real estate fund The MD Fund restricted to doctors also has no fees The fund is a partnership between Royal LePage which manages the fund and acts as a surrogate landlord for the five properties it presently holds and Royal Trust which handles marketing sales and unit holder communications through its branches While the absence of purchase charges makes Royal LePage attractive to investors they can also flee without being penalized by rear load fees Redemptions have shrunk asset value per cent from its high of million at the market peak in while liquidity has been static at million Real estate is no longer on the cocktail party circuit Mostowyk says The only way we can maintain our investor base is to convince them that we are doing the best job possible That s precisely what the Royal LePage s vice president of investments has been doing since he became fund manager in RLCREF today owns plazas in Bedford N S near Halifax Saskatoon and Victoria and a medical centre in Oakville as well as being co operator of an office building in Mississauga s Meadowvale The plazas in secondary markets were acquired in and What this fund has been doing since is tending its garden We ve got a portfolio of properties says Mostowyk We haven t bought or sold anything and we re trying to improve the value of the properties we have In the fund took advantage of depressed construction costs to build a square metre addition to its three storey medical building across from Oakville Trafalgar Hospital Similarly over the last three years RLCREF has spent million renovating the Westbrook Shopping Centre a square metre store strip mall in the Victoria suburb of Langford Having done everything there is to do to it the question now is whether we should sell it and realize the profit or rent it and continue to get the per cent net Mostowyk has recommended to the fund s five man investment committee that the plaza be put up for sale The board s next quarterly meeting is slated for June though the issue could be decided by telephone conference before then Mostowyk wants to diversify the fund further I m looking at industrial properties It s a process of elimination You don t want to be in places where there is really heavy government involvement like Ottawa Edmonton Regina Quebec City St John s or Winnipeg We re looking to where markets are recovering Ontario Alberta and B C And you want to be in a major market And that leaves Toronto Calgary and Vancouver big cities with a better economy of scale The recession has opened up a lot of opportunities for us With the fund s modest debt of million Mostowyk could raise million today through new mortgages Securities regulations permit indebtedness of up to per cent of net assets But he is reluctant to borrow at current interest rates anticipating a drop in the second half of the year If the Victoria shopping centre were to be sold Mostowyk could either reinvest the money in industrial properties distribute the gains to the unit holders or pay down existing debts Given his conservative investment style he says he would like to do all three The real estate business has never been and never will be short term he cautions I ve always told investors that unless they invest for five year horizons they re wasting their time Unfortunately he concedes the industry has not been able to communicate that long term perspective to investors The typical institutional portfolio holds to per cent in real estate he notes I think that s not a bad strategy for the average investor as well He should hold some single digit amount in real estate This core holding will yield a base income stream of around per cent The income return has always got this stable factor to it",0

People experiencing financial difficulty are being targeted by financial advisers who promise to unlock their superannuation benefits. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission ASIC has warned consumers under the age of to steer clear of anyone who promises to arrange quickly for their preserved superannuation benefits to be paid out in cash The warning follows several successful enforcement actions by ASIC in recent months against financial advisers who have arranged for their clients preserved superannuation benefits to be paid out Peter Kell head of consumer protection says Some cases have involved the theft by unscrupulous advisers of all or part of the consumers superannuation benefits In other cases some advisers have taken fees of up to per cent of the super benefit before forwarding the remainder to the client Advisers have used a variety of methods to convince the consumer s superannuation fund to pay out the benefits directly to the adviser in cash ASIC is also calling on superannuation funds to be careful about requests to forward super benefits directly to advisers rather than into another fund particularly when the member is under Superannuation trustees can now check on the ATO Web site to see if a fund to which they are transferring superannuation is a regulated superannuation fund Kell says In one case a Melbourne accountant Ross Patrick Zagari was convicted and sentenced to three years jail for fraudulently obtaining the payment of million in superannuation benefits on behalf of clients between August and October Under superannuation law the preserved component of a member s benefits cannot be paid out in cash until he or she turns retires from the workforce after age or meets certain other limited criteria Kell says It is possible in limited circumstances for money to be released early on the grounds of severe financial hardship but consumers should talk directly with their fund in such cases Your super fund or the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority can provide information about early access in legitimate cases of severe hardship Visit the authority s Web site at www apra com au or call it on",0

hedge fund is targeting another company: Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia
Inc.
Only this time, Rocker is snapping up shares of the battered company,
not shorting them. And, no, this isn't another lame Martha Stewart joke. Rocker running against the tide has accumulated control of about of Martha Stewart Living s A shares at a time when other big players have dumped the stock and many Wall Street analysts are negative on the company Chairman and founder Martha Stewart is under investigation for her sale of ImClone Systems Inc stock and analysts and investors fear the company is vulnerable to a backlash if her legal situation worsens she has denied wrongdoing Partly citing the probes Martha Stewart Living said recently it had experienced a decline in renewal rates for its flagship magazine softer ratings for its syndicated television show and a lower than expected response to a catalog mailing So what is Rocker thinking The people who have sold it in large measure are people who don t wish to be associated with the controversy says David Rocker general partner at Rocker Partners which has more than million under management It is distressed investing if you will It is a surprising bet for the hedge fund Rocker attracted a lot of attention a few years ago when it took a hefty short position on Lernout Hauspie Speech Products NV the then soaring Belgian speech recognition firm As others were touting the company the hedge fund raised questions about its sales figures and prospects Although initially forced to cover its big bearish bet as the stock kept rising Rocker s call eventually was the right one Lernout Hauspie went out of business after an audit revealed it had booked phony revenues Mr Rocker says his firm ultimately enjoyed an excellent return on its bet after the difficult start Short sellers bet against a stock by using borrowed shares when selling aiming to replace them with cheaper ones later after the price drops Rocker has paid an average a share for more than one million shares of Martha Stewart Living making the hedge fund the third largest investor in the company s common stock after ValueAct Capital Partners and Capital Guardian Trust Co respectively ValueAct which acquired a block of three million shares from Ms Stewart in January has a board seat The company is still controlled however by Ms Stewart who owns almost all of its Class B shares that carry superior voting power So far at least the hedge fund s wager appears to be paying off Shares of Martha Stewart Living have doubled since hitting a week low of on Oct Yesterday the stock climbed cents to a share at p m in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Despite the move though the stock remains well off its week high of nearly hit this past spring A spokesman for Martha Stewart Living declined to comment for this article Mr Rocker s assessment of Martha Stewart Living is fairly straightforward He is attracted to the company s cash hoard which equates to a share and its core franchise Also Mr Rocker without claiming any specialized knowledge about Ms Stewart s legal situation assumes the worst is over His firm has years of experience shorting stocks of companies that have been guilty of financial and other shenanigans and he and his colleagues feel the media and investor response to the Martha Stewart matter is out of proportion with her alleged crimes Says Marc Cohodes a Rocker general partner We afflict the comfortable and comfort the afflicted The Securities and Exchange Commission s enforcement staff has informed Ms Stewart that it intends to recommend filing civil securities fraud charges against her in connection with her sale of ImClone stock Federal prosecutors in New York also are investigating Ms Stewart and weighing possible criminal charges of securities fraud obstruction of justice and making false statements about the reason for her sale People close to the matter say the investigation is still progressing with no decision made yet about whether to charge Ms Stewart I m only aware of the public information about the case but we believed that if the government had a material case it would have been presented by this time Mr Rocker says We are not investing in Martha Stewart herself We are investing in Martha Stewart the company He shrugs off the legal and public relations expenses that have dragged down earnings in recent quarters He describes the declining magazine renewal rates softer television ratings and lukewarm catalog response as transient issues saying they will disappear when the legal problems are resolved It is understandable that sales are suffering somewhat as it is a very contentious issue unless you start with the premise that this will resolve itself The recent gains in the stock are puzzling to some Wall Street analysts who think the company is still wrestling with difficult issues Of the eight analysts following the company only one has a buy recommendation on the stock according to Thomson First Call a unit of Thomson Corp which compiles stock research data The rest are hold or sell ratings Others including Merrill Lynch Co have suspended coverage completely saying it is impossible to value the company while the investigation into Ms Stewart is unresolved Obviously some people are seeing some reason to be hopeful but my rating speaks about my concern about the fundamentals of the business says Alissa Goldwasser an analyst at William Blair Co who lowered her recommendation on the stock to underperform in early November Some investors attributed the recent bounce to factors including short sellers covering their bets and bargain hunting investors spotting a seemingly cheap stock based on the cash in the bank Others were lured back to the stock due to the lack of developments on the probe into Ms Stewart although some of these already have exited the positions In any case Mr Rocker is one of the only investors who has taken a substantial long position since the scandal erupted in the summer Initially Rocker executives were reluctant to discuss the firm s holdings in Martha Stewart Living in part to try to stave off awkward questions from its investors who are more accustomed to the firm s cold eyed approach to spotting overvalued stocks The Martha Stewart Living stake represents about of the hedge fund s overall portfolio But Martha Stewart Living isn t the firm s only long position other large holdings include Magna Entertainment Corp Sanmina SCI Corp and software concern Interwoven Inc Yet Rocker still favors the short side Of the to positions held by the hedge fund about are short The bearish positions include Pre Paid Legal Services Inc United Surgical Partners International Inc and American Capital Strategies Ltd And that short selling has benefited the hedge fund in this year s weak market The firm earned returns net of fees for the year through the end of September Mr Rocker says In the same period the Standard Poor s stock index was down The fund in the five years through the end of December is up after fees far outpacing the broader market",0

Stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters.","PolitiFact Ohio
Stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters. Mitt Romney In an ad airing in Ohio called Where did all the money go the Romney campaign accuses President Obama of supporting jobs overseas and cites the example of Fisker Automotive the maker of a high end plug in electric sedan Where did all the Obama stimulus money go Friends donors campaign supporters special interest groups Where did the Obama stimulus money go Solyndra million taxpayer dollars Bankrupt So where did the Obama stimulus money go Windmills from China Electric cars from Finland The day after that ad launched Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus expanded on the attack in Philadelphia President Obama took half a billion dollars of your taxpayer money and gave it to Fisker Automotive because they promised to create jobs at their Wilmington plant Priebus said But they didn t create jobs for you Their factory in Delaware was supposed to be open today but instead it s closed And Fisker is still building their cars in Finland Did stimulus money go to Finland What is the financial deal between the United States and Fisker and did it produce jobs in the U S Was that deal a payback to special friends of the Obama administration What Fisker got In an American car company Fisker Automotive won a total of million in loan guarantees to build two high end electric hybrids the Karma and the Atlantic originally named Nina The goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware Work on the Atlantic is currently on hold and the Delaware plant has yet to open The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States but according to the U S Energy Department the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about Finnish workers Company spokesman Roger Ornisher says the plant has produced over Karmas so far Not stimulus dollars The claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects First the money did not come from the stimulus Rather it came as a loan not a grant or a tax credit through the Energy Department s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program That program predates the Obama administration It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act also known as the stimulus In fact it s a program signed into existence by President George W Bush in and first funded by legislation Bush signed in The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application The Obama administration was in charge when the company s loan was approved The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it Not half a billion dollars Even as a loan Fisker Automotive has not received anywhere close to half a billion dollars So far Fisker has drawn down about million and the Energy Department won t release any more until the company completes more work The government loan package came in two parts An initial million was for design and engineering to complete the Karma using at least percent American made parts A second million loan would be to open an American plant to build the Atlantic Just about all of that second part is still in government hands For those who would say there s no guarantee that some of the federal dollars were not used to pay Finnish workers the company has an answer It says it raised much more money from private investors Ornisher told PolitiFact the total is now over billion and that the money spent in Finland was easily within the amount of that private money Fisker Automotive also says that the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to ensure that all federal dollars are spent in the U S The jobs The Karma and Atlantic projects support some Fisker employees in the United States according to Ornisher He says it s much harder to estimate the number of jobs associated with the supply of parts percent of which are supposed to come from American companies Ornishers also says the company has sold about cars in the U S and that provides work at some retailers across the country Political connections The ad hints darkly that a lot of this is tied to political friends of the president Senior Romney campaign adviser Ed Gillespie singled out the Fisker Automotive deal and one of its investors John Doerr You know you have John Doerr who raised a lot of money for President Obama and got appointed to an economic recovery advisory board he said during a briefing And then his firm had a big investment in Fisker Automotive which got over half a billion dollars in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy which did not result in jobs being created in America but actually jobs being created overseas in Finland But Kleiner Perkins Doerr s firm did quite well Doerr is a big Democratic donor more than since according to the Center for Responsive Politics And Ornisher described Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers as one of the major investors in Fisker But as the Washington Post noted Kleiner has many partners and some of them are hefty donors on the Republican side One Ray Lane backed John McCain in The Romney campaign ad said that stimulus dollars paid for jobs in Finland There is nothing accurate in this claim The loan guarantees Fisker got were not part of the stimulus and there is no evidence that any government dollars paid for work done by Finnish workers Ornisher the company spokesman told PolitiFact the contract to produce the cars in Finland had been signed before the federal loan was approved Also measures were put in place to ensure that taxpayer dollars only went for work done in America Fisker Automotive has yet to open the factory in Delaware but it also hasn t received the large government loan needed to do that The ad s suggestion that the Fisker loan was a reward to a political supporter also falls flat The program was approved initially by the Bush administration We rule the claim False See PolitiFact Ohio stories online at

=HEARD ON THE STREET: Insurers Feel The Heat 
 
   By Sean Walters 
   A DOW JONES COLUMN 
 

Banks have borne the brunt of the credit crisis to date in Europe, but as the credit cycle turns down, many insurers could see the value of their non-equity portfolios as well as their stock-market holdings deteriorate sharply. That raises the possibility they'll need hefty injections of new capital too. Regulators are less likely to tolerate insurers with weak capital bases having learned the hard way about the dangers of excessively leveraged banks The emphasis of Europe s new Solvency II regulations still under review is an indication the regulators mean business on capital adequacy Insurers with substantial life operations like French insurance giant Axa and Italy s Generali are able to allocate some investment losses to their policyholders saving shareholders some pain But the problem is many of the other asset classes they have invested in are potentially riskier than stocks and also declining in value So the lengths many insurers have already gone to reduce the size of their equity portfolios are comforting only to a degree Property typically makes up of insurers invested assets The likes of Axa and Netherlands based Aegon have relatively large exposures to sub AAA grade commercial mortgage backed securities much of which is U S based Axa s EUR billion CMBS has already been written down by and might face further impairments as economic conditions deteriorate Corporate debt is another danger Aegon still holds EUR billion in corporate bonds after selling almost EUR billion in the first half The trouble is over half are rated BBB or below Spreads have widened by more than basis points in the third quarter of as the threat of default increases The insurer has as little as EUR million in excess capital according to JP Morgan While Europe s other insurers have more excess capital than Aegon a prolonged recession and the impact that has on property markets and corporate balance sheets could leave many in need of capital But there s little private sector appetite for their stock Europe s insurance stocks have underperformed banks by since the start of October hardly an appealing prospect for governments which have already committed billions to bailing out their banking sectors HEARD ON THE STREET Eastern Europe s Missing Euro Umbrella By Paul Hannon A DOW JONES COLUMN The European Union is all about security The euro zone its little brother is too In the big bad world of global financial capitalism it offers a haven for smaller European countries whose economies are inevitably vulnerable to a severe credit crunch Unfortunately some of the small and defenceless didn t make it in to the euro zone in time With investors selling out of every asset that isn t ultra safe currencies in eastern Europe are coming under mounting pressure Many of these countries haven t behaved anything like as irresponsibly as Iceland but that won t stop foreign investors from pulling out in a flight to save haven investments Some eastern European countries could already be in the euro zone if they had wanted to The Czech Republic Hungary Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Poland all joined the E U in giving them the chance to adopt the euro from But the euro zone has some strict membership rules chief among which are that you don t run a big budget deficit and accept the high inflation rates that come with that behavior An uninspiring generation of politicians took the easy way out The target dates for adopting the euro drifted further and further into the coming decade The voters who backed them will come to regret that tardiness if they don t already With foreign capital likely to flee either interest rates will have to be raised sky high to defend existing currency levels or inflation rates will soar destroying real incomes Only Slovakia showed any foresight It will join the euro zone next year And be a lot better off than its neighbors as a result HEARD ON THE STREET Japan s Tortoise Poised To Outpace Hares By James Simms A DOW JONES COLUMN Japan Inc s modest rebound from its own lost decade has spared the nation the high

critical test case Panic has reached fever pitch Morgan Stanley s shares have come under severe pressure including a drop Thursday as investors bet it s the latest Wall Street firm to get into trouble But if Morgan Stanley pulls through it would represent an important milestone in the search for a stock market bottom At some point a high profile financial firm will survive fear stoked selling When that happens it might abate In theory Morgan Stanley looks OK It has marked down bad assets aggressively and management has responded to the crisis with realism After changing its banking status Morgan Stanley has access to wider Federal Reserve funding Also the bank s capital ratios got a boost upon agreeing a billion capital infusion from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group scheduled to close Tuesday Given the circumstances Mitsubishi has an incentive to walk away But it isn t the sort of bank that reneges on deal terms Doing so would be a risk as its recent acquisition of a U S commercial bank means it needs to be on good terms with the Fed Granted all that might not help Morgan Stanley if clients leave and trading counterparties pull back and demand higher collateral To squash the fear a private sector solution would be best for example if Mitsubishi itself offered up a big credit line to Morgan Stanley Or if another bank stepped up to buy the firm outright If not the government might yet need to step in And if that led to a punitive outcome for shareholders the market would take aim at the next firm HEARD ON THE STREET Still Some Energy Left In Mkt By Rebecca Smith A DOW JONES COLUMN Power companies that sell electricity in deregulated markets have been among the hardest hit by the stock market selloff So hard in fact that they are selling for a fraction of their inherent value The market capitalization of Reliant Energy Inc has fallen by about over the past month to billion It has net debt of about billion But the replacement cost of its generating plants suggests an enterprise value of billion to billion says Samuel Brothwell analyst at Wachovia A similar calculation by Citigroup in early October found four other companies Dynegy Inc Mirant Corp NRG Energy Inc and Calpine Corp also were selling for a fraction of the value of their power plants alone Some companies such as Allegheny Energy Inc and Sempra Energy which also own regulated utilities with predictable earnings have still fallen sharply in the recent market slide The energy sector the third biggest borrower after government and finance relies on debt to finance at least half the cost of building power plants For that reason credit turmoil dealt a blow to the sector by creating uncertainty about the cost and availability of capital As stocks slide it becomes less attractive and more difficult to issue equity as a source of capital Shares in Houston based Dynegy which owns more than megawatts of power plants in deregulated markets have lost half their value in the past month and since May One reason is that falling natural gas prices off since early summer have depressed wholesale power prices and lowered revenue projections That is especially painful for firms such as Dynegy that don t sell much of their expected output under multiyear contracts Unlike banks many of which hold hard to value mortgage assets energy companies own power plants that make an essential commodity electricity Assuming firms get through the crunch slumping values now may lay the groundwork for a sharp recovery Oct EDT DJ HEARD ON THE STREET Daily Digest That s because current tough conditions while making life difficult for those needing debt to finance existing projects also choke off investment for new plants At some point in the future an economic rebound should push up demand forcing existing plants to run harder and prices to go up allowing them to generate stronger profits Of course one notable buyer has already identified a bargain in the sector billionaire investor Warren Buffett His Berkshire Hathaway Inc stepped in last month to rescue Constellation Energy Group Inc for billion Constellation owns all or part of three nuclear generating stations utility Baltimore Gas and Electric Co assorted other power plants and an electricity retailing business Mr Buffett s deal gives him the whole thing for less than half what one new reactor is

COLUMN Consolidation is proceeding in Australia s banking sector as the nation s leading banks mop up smaller players but such signs of strength shouldn t divert attention from those top institutions funding The sector s so called four pillars Commonwealth Bank of Australia Australia New Zealand Bank Westpac and National Australia Bank are among only banks around the world that retain a double A credit rating To date the banks high credit rating has given them access to wholesale markets particularly to international interbank lending facilities which provide up to a third of their funding needs But the action of the U K government this week to guarantee term funding raised by that country s banks might prove harmful to their counterparts down under The limited funds available globally for interbank lending may flow more to British institutions which effectively have a sovereign guarantee that trumps even the Australian banks high ratings According to Fitch Ratings figures around of the top four Australian banks wholesale funding matures within months An unintended consequence of the U K government s action could be to heighten the cost and availability of refinancing for Australian banks At the same time the strength of Australian banks loan books still viewed as robust by agencies like Fitch is under threat as the country s economy slows Unemployment is edging up while business and consumer confidence levels are at decade lows A survey by Fujitsu Consulting found Australian households were experiencing stress in making mortgage payments by August a fivefold increase from March In the banks favor are signs Australia s economic authorities are getting on the ball The coordinated rate cut this week by global central banks was heralded by a basis point rate cut from the Reserve Bank of Australia the day before More pro activism may be needed Australia now lags behind many other countries in the generosity of its bank deposit guarantees And given its banks reliance on wholesale funding Australia should be at the front of the queue of countries if the U K government s measures to support bank funding are to be reproduced around the world HEARD ON THE STREET Singapore Economy Needs New Medicine By Mark Cranfield A DOW JONES COLUMN Singapore s central bank has switched to a looser monetary policy for the first time since the SARS virus struck Asia in This time the ailment is entirely man made and potentially more devastating to the economy The government is now starkly acknowledging the difficulties firms face to sustain economic activities as the credit crisis gathers pace Back in Singapore acted quickly to quarantine citizens who had contracted SARS to reduce the risk of the virus spreading It worked and Singapore s economy went through only a shallow contraction However the central bank s easing pales in comparison to the massive rate cuts delivered across the world this week Singapore is now in recession and few believe it has done enough to get its economy growing again Singapore manages monetary policy by allowing its currency to rise or in this case fall against a basket of its main trade partners The risk is that using the Singapore dollar in this way could prove both inflationary and ineffective at raising exports when global demand is on a downswing So this might be just the right time for Singapore to take a new medicine and adopt an interest rate policy This would strengthen its hand in everything from setting mortgage lending rates to injecting liquidity into money markets After all property values and interbank lending lie at the heart of the credit crisis Other remedies are available much of Singapore s private sector is in the hands of government linked companies Several large infrastructure projects which were put on hold earlier this year could be restarted for a fiscal boost Local tax rates while low could be reduced further they re still higher than those in Hong Kong its main Asia rival for human capital In the meantime Singapore unlike Hong Kong can t look for succor from a hinterland of a billion plus people to help soften the economic effects of the credit

JONES COLUMN It isn t just Ukrainian tycoons and bank executives who are getting burned by the stock market crash Cable TV magnate John Malone who made a fortune with companies such as Tele Communications Inc and Liberty Media may have come under some pressure The Liberty chairman sold million shares of his Liberty Capital A tracking stock back to the company for a share Tuesday according to a Liberty filing What raised eyebrows is that the sale came just three months after Mr Malone paid more than each for million of the shares The sale has little effect on his voting control as the A shares are low voting But it s a little embarrassing given the likelihood that he got hit with a margin call A government filing in July noted that Mr Malone had pledged a portion of his Liberty holdings to Bank of America in connection with a line of credit As of Tuesday the pledged stock was down to million from early July it has fallen even further since Mr Malone likely has plenty of other assets he could have sold to raise million including some of the huge chunks of land he has acquired in recent years But he might have decided that a roughly million loss on Liberty

As a homeowner, foreclosure is something you never want to experience. While nobody wants to admit to the reality of a foreclosure, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s better to face it head on so youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know what to do to minimize its effects on your finances. What Is Foreclosure Taking possession of and selling the mortgaged property is how a lender legally attempts to recoup the money owing on a defaulted loan Usually a borrower enters into default when they fall behind on a pre determined amount of payments each month but it is also possible when they violate other conditions outlined in the mortgage instrument If you find yourself in foreclosure before attempting all foreclosure law remedies available to you in Lexington KY you can try negotiating with your lenders first Call your lender right away to discuss your alternatives which may include a loan modification forbearance or a short sale if you are in danger of going into foreclosure If all else fails you can always sell your Lexington KY house fast in pre foreclosure If you find yourself thinking How do I sell my house in foreclosure in Lexington KY you re on the right page Here at Rylo Homes we share some valuable tips on what you can do with your Lexington KY property when it s at risk of foreclosure Talk or negotiate with your lender You must reach out to your lender as soon as you realize you need more time to catch up on payments The last thing you want is to leave your lender out of the discussion when you begin to fall behind on your mortgage Many lenders are actually more than eager to work with their clients to achieve a solution when it comes to foreclosures This is because they would prefer to receive some repayment of their debt than none at all Ask your lender whether they are willing to make any changes to your loan when you speak with them Ask for a grant of forbearance You might not be able to make mortgage payments on time due to a short term financial problem such as a medical emergency or a sudden unforeseen loss in income Your lender might agree to help by offering you a forbearance if they think you have a good explanation for the missed payments Your lender may agree to a repayment plan that temporarily reduces your payments or even suspends them for a predetermined period depending on your financial situation However you must assure your lender that you will strictly adhere to the new repayment schedule otherwise they might not agree Request for a mortgage modification You can refinance or lengthen the term of your mortgage debt through loan modification Depending on your financial situation the lender might accept monthly mortgage payments To be eligible for this option you must convince your lender that your financial issues will soon be resolved The lender may demand a lump sum up front or agree to a monthly installment for the difference if there is a deferral plan agreement that places the entire or partial amount of the arrearages at the conclusion of the loan Do a short sale When an owner sells their home but owes more than it is worth it is known as a short sale You must get your lender s consent before executing a short sale though While a short sale may give you the cash you need to pay off your debts you should exercise caution For many borrowers short sales are unfavorable because they can hurt one s credit score Sell your Lexington KY property fast to a cash home buyer Selling your house to an experienced cash home buyer is another option you might want to think about Cash home buyers are prepared to purchase properties in any condition even foreclosure You can receive a reasonable cash offer from a cash homebuyer in as little as hours when you sell your house to them giving you the funds you need to pay off your debt Additionally Kentucky foreclosure rules provide that you are entitled to keep any extra money from sales once your loan has been repaid If you want to sell your house in foreclosure in Lexington KY for the least effort possible selling to a cash home buyer in Lexington KY is your most reasonable option Rylo Homes buys houses in Lexington KY regardless of the condition or situation they are in so you know you won t have to spend on renovations or repairs to make your home more marketable We re direct buyers and we pay in cash to arrange a quick close For more information about our home buying process give us a call at today Media Contact Company Name Rylo Homes Contact Person Jon M Email rylohomes gmail com Phone Address Village Plaza Suite City Shelbyville State Kentucky Country United States Website rylohomes com Source www abnewswire com M Communications disclaims all liability for information provided within M PressWIRE Data supplied by named party parties Further information on M PressWIRE can be obtained at http www m com on the world wide web Inquiries to info m com",0

Paul King, Head of April King Legal explains 3 simple steps you can take now to protect your hard-earned assets Avoid unnecessary 1 Care Fee Costs A lot of people are still unaware that if they need social care in later life, their assets will be means tested by the local authority to help pay for these services. This goes back to the Community Care Act 1990. If you require social care in later life the local authority will look to use your assets until you get down to a lower limit when the local authority will take over the fees There are many myths about how people can protect their assets from being used like this The main one being that a parent should simply sign their house over to the children now so it won t be taken into consideration for means testing That s just not true and your local authority will look to see if you ve deliberately deprived yourself of an asset by giving property away going back over any period in time Paul King explains how Bloodline Wills from April King can help I leave my half of the house to our children but state that they do not inherit my half until both myself and my wife die This way if my wife needs care or remarries after my death then my half is safe for our children My wife does the same in her Will It s important to note that nothing happens while myself and my wife are alive and we remain owners of our own home April King do not recommend so called Asset Protection Trusts which involve transferring your house to your children during your lifetime This may be deemed to be deliberate deprivation and create more problems than you re trying to solve Keep it in the family with Bloodline Wills Mirror Wills are when a couple leave everything to each other on the first death then to the children when the second partner dies But modern family life means these type of Wills leave a lot to chance Paul King says If I have a Mirror Will leaving everything to my wife and she remarries or goes into care after my death then either the new husband or the local authority are likely to inherit most if not all of my estate ahead of our children Even if our children are named in my Mirror Will it is by no means certain that they will inherit anything This is because a remarriage would cancel the Will my wife had previously made with me and make the new husband next of kin This often comes as a big shock to my clients who had perhaps thought that all was in order and that the family bloodline would one day inherit The same is true for thinking that their children our grandchildren will one day benefit under our Mirror Wills If any of our children should die leaving everything to their husband or wife and that son inlaw or daughter in law should then remarry then our grandchildren would be the ones to lose out under the line of inheritance Paul continues These things can be avoided by having a Bloodline Will Under these types of specialist Wills from April King your children have complete control and access to the inheritance they receive from you but they get added protection from the twists and turns of modern family life Maintain control with a Lasting Power of Attorney The Lasting Power of Attorney is a relatively new introduction and is divided into two parts one that deals with finance while the other deals with health and welfare In many ways it s similar to a passport a document that s registered now and one which can be physically handed to the attorneys should the need arise It allows the attorneys perhaps the children to deal with banks and pension companies etc should their parent become incapacitated but also enables them to deal with matters such as where the parent should live and how they receive care Your attorneys again perhaps your children must legally act in your best interests at all times You can choose a number of attorneys to act either jointly or independently and April King can advise on the various options available to you Having a Lasting Power of Attorney removes the burden on children should ill health happen further down the line It helps a family deal with bank accounts and so on during a parent s lifetime and ceases on death Crucially you have to complete a Lasting Power of Attorney while you are still in good mental health If someone becomes ill through say a stroke or dementia this option is lost and the family would have to apply for an order from the Court of Protection a drawn out and expensive process It is therefore a good idea for clients to plan ahead and remove any future burden from the family The challenge is to avoid waiting until it is too late and to act now instead",0

Small deductions here, a credit there, a bit of help for homeowners caught in the mortgage crisis -- all add up to tax savings for savvy military filers.   

But a big thing -- Congress' last-minute fix of the alternative minimum tax -- delayed filing for several million early birds who usually submit returns months ahead of the April 15 deadline.    Affected were taxpayers claiming any of five credits related to the AMT This year they couldn t file before February Like last year troops serving overseas are allowed a filing extension until June For troops serving in a combat zone filing can be postponed up to days from the date of return from the combat zone or days from the last date of continuous hospitalization for injuries received while serving in a combat zone No interest or penalties accrue during this extension This includes time extensions to pay the tax due and file the return Write COMBAT ZONE along with your deployment date on the top of your return It s a good idea too to let the IRS know about this special status Send an e mail to combatzone irs gov For million other taxpayers it s business as usual the IRS says And for everyone including those affected by the five AMT related forms tax returns are still due April Taxes owed must be paid by that date even if you file for the automatic six month extension Filing electronically and having your refund electronically deposited into a bank account will get it to you weeks earlier than choosing to receive it by government check We strongly encourage taxpayers to file electronically particularly those affected by late tax law changes said Linda Stiff acting IRS commissioner Filing electronically makes things easier by reducing errors and speeding up refunds Military service members and spouses can get tax help at home and abroad through a program coordinated by the Armed Forces Tax Council The IRS provides tax software and tax prep training For more information see IRS Publication Armed Forces Tax Guide available on the IRS Web site http www irs gov or order a free copy by calling TAX FORM Taxpayers using home tax preparation software should check the companies Web sites often for updates Those still grappling with paper forms can print updated forms from the IRS Web site at http www irs gov formspubs index html or order them from the IRS by calling When the dust settles you ll find there s little new for filers this season other than the usual inflation related adjustments But even small items can add up Make sure that you ve got the bases covered Make sure you know all of the deductions you re entitled to the credits you can claim said Maggie Doedtman client advice manager for H R Block the tax preparation giant Tax breaks for homeowners Leading the list of new items for are tax breaks for homeowners facing foreclosure or struggling with house payments that include mortgage insurance premiums For more on how the housing crisis is affecting military families go to http www militarytimes com money Mortgage insurance is required by government and private lenders on home purchases in which the buyer pays less than percent as a down payment For taxpayers can deduct mortgage insurance premiums on home acquisition debt that was new or refinanced in But premiums paid on a mortgage that predated cannot be deducted Like many deductions this one phases out as income rises Only taxpayers with adjusted gross incomes of or less can take the full deduction Homeowners facing foreclosure have one bright spot a provision Congress passed late last year as the mortgage crisis took its toll Taxpayers granted forgiveness of mortgage debt in don t have to pay taxes on the amount of that forgiveness up to million million for a married person filing separately Previously loan forgiveness often was taxed as income Energy credits Despite high fuel prices and other energy costs energy tax breaks are petering out Homeowners who made certain energy saving home improvements in have one last chance to claim the residential energy credit but only if they didn t use all the credit in Items that qualify include insulation certain water heaters air conditioners fans furnaces skylights exterior windows and doors solar panels and metal roofs with pigmented coatings designed to reduce a home s heat gain The credit is usually percent of the cost though there may be separate limits for specific devices The credit is limited to for the and tax years combined Taxpayers who bought a new hybrid or alternative fuel vehicle in are eligible for the alternative motor vehicle credit but this tax break also phases out beginning in the second calendar quarter after the quarter in which the manufacturer records its th sale of hybrids and alternative fuel vehicles Check the IRS Web site for specific manufacturers models and allowable credits Keep a record of donations There s a wrinkle for charitable contributions tighter record keeping requirements for smaller cash contributions Previously for amounts less than a taxpayer s notes or personal check register reflecting the donations was sufficient documentation There is no deduction for cash contributions unless verified by the receiving charity Contributions exceeding must have a substantiating letter from the charity Donations of used items exceeding may require records that include date of purchase and purchase price or an explanation for why you don t have these records Now all cash donations need official records such as a check bank copy of the check electronic funds transfer record credit card or credit union statement These must list the charity donation amount and the date paid or transaction posting date A charity s written acknowledgment showing that information is also OK You don t have to submit those records to the IRS just keep them in case you are audited What are your chances of being audited Slim unless you have a high income and large deductions to go with it The AMT scramble However moderate income taxpayers increasingly are ensnared by the tax because it isn t indexed for inflation In December Congress spared more than million taxpayers an average of in extra taxes for by freezing AMT growth for a year Because Congress acted so late the IRS had to scramble to reprogram its processing system Since the AMT disallows deductions and credits it affects a dozen or so tax forms used by many taxpayers not just by the wealthy The IRS was able to rework most forms quickly However the forms for five credits required more significant reprogramming Form Education Credits Form Residential Energy Credits Schedule Child and Dependent Care Expenses for Form A Filers Form Mortgage Interest Credit and Form District of Columbia First Time Homebuyer Credit Two of the credits the mortgage interest credit and the D C homebuyer credit are used by few taxpayers And there s a way around Schedule for the child and dependent care credit Early filers could switch to Form and attach Form Child and Dependent Care Expenses The IRS and tax preparation professionals urged taxpayers to start on their returns as soon as W forms arrive in January even if they couldn t file until later Tim Gokey group president of H R Block retail tax services said taxpayers could file a return without the AMT related forms and amend it later but there are drawbacks to that approach Amended returns must be mailed to the IRS and refund checks on amended returns are mailed as well which takes six to eight weeks Taxpayers are better off waiting until the forms are finalized then filing the complete return online Gokey said A refund on a return filed electronically comes in eight to days if the taxpayer has the IRS deposit the money directly into a bank account Three credits to consider Several credits make a nice dent in the amount of taxes payable from the Earned Income Tax Credit to credits for children and education related expenses Since the amount of the credit is usually phased out after a certain level of adjusted gross income having nontaxed combat zone pay can make you eligible to take some of these credits Service members should consider these three credits at tax time Earned Income Tax Credit This is a refundable credit paid to lower income individuals and families Because it is refundable you get the credit amount even if your taxes are zero Single or married taxpayers who do not have children are older than and have an adjusted gross income less than single or married and investment income less than qualify for a credit of The maximum credit for single or married taxpayers with one qualifying child is For those with two or more qualifying children the maximum credit is You must have earned taxable income to qualify for the credit For military members who have little or no taxable income due to combat zone tax exclusions nontaxed combat zone pay can be included if it will increase the amount of credit that would be paid without counting the nontaxed combat pay Retirement Savings Contribution Credit The maximum allowable credit is equal to percent of the first contributed to a retirement plan such as the Thrift Savings Plan an IRA or a k The credit phases out at higher income levels but if you have nontaxed combat pay you should check it out However if you have zero tax you will not get a credit payment Education credits There are two to be aware of the Hope Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit Maximum credits are for the Hope Credit and percent of the

Mike Beebe on Wednesday called a special session, to begin Thursday, on a plan to stabilize health insurance premiums for teachers and other public school employees.

Beebe said legislative leaders informed him they have enough votes in the House and Senate to pass a series of bills ranging from stopgap legislation to hold down rate increases next year to a comprehensive plan to stabilize the public school employees' health insurance system. The special session is set to begin at p m Thursday If everybody agrees and it goes smoothly it could go Thursday Friday and Saturday Beebe said The governor s call for a special session includes six bills Four will address the rising health insurance costs and one which is backed by the governor and will be considered separately would phase out the excess property tax revenue some school districts have kept and redirect those funds to the state The sixth bill added late Wednesday afternoon would repeal Act of which eased regulatory requirements on municipalities and industries that discharge minerals into Arkansas waterways The proposals to address the teacher insurance crisis includes both a short term and long term solution The short term proposal calls for using million from the state surplus to avert a percent rise in health insurance rates set to go into effect Jan Another million a year would hold down future increases I would not be issuing this call if we hadn t already seen extraordinary bipartisan efforts to help our teachers and other public school employees in Arkansas Beebe said Wednesday After dozens of meetings with legislators district officials teachers and other involved parties we have a solution that may not please every individual group but will help alleviate the spike in insurance rates and shore up this insurance program The governor told reporters earlier Wednesday that House leaders had secured votes two in excess of the needed for a three fourths majority to pass the appropriations Senate leaders who Tuesday were a few votes shy of a supermajority notified the governor early Wednesday they had secured votes two more than the three fourths majority needed in that chamber Sen Johnny Key R Mountain Home chairman of the Senate Eduction Committee said Wednesday some members finally agreed to support the plan to address the rising teacher insurance costs when more emphasis was placed a proposal to create a task force to study long term structural reforms of the public employees insurance program Several senators wanted assurances that the task force would be proactive and not fall apart or have its recommendations sit on a shelf Key said The legislative intent is we re not going to have to continue to bail out the system he told reporters Reforms are going to have to take place and if they don t take place this funding stream that we re putting in there we re going to pull those back down the road if we don t adopt real reforms The task force would be required to issue a report and make recommendations by June to be reviewed by legislative committees and all budget issues addressed in time for consideration in the legislative session Key said the panel would conduct a comprehensive review of the state and public school employee insurance systems including governance and structure board structure and funding options Separately lawmakers will consider the phase out of excess property tax revenue held by some districts Beebe said the measure would address a Arkansas Supreme Court ruling and keep the state s school funding in line with the intent of provisions that ended the long running Lake View school funding case As for addressing the school employees insurance crisis Beebe set legislative consensus on both short term and long term solutions as a condition for calling a special session Legislative leaders quickly forged agreement on using surplus funds for the short term fix The long term plan took more time It would redirect million annually to the school employees health insurance system million from general revenue million from the school facilities improvement program and million from state funding for teacher professional development Another million would be passed on to school employees in the form of premiums though that amount could be reduced as a result of reforms to be recommended by the task force Some lawmakers said Wednesday they support the overall plan but don t like tapping funding for professional development to pay for health insurance I think this is a move in the wrong direction said Sen Uvalde Lindsey D Fayetteville Currently there is a push for implementation of Common Core implementation of strategies for better outcomes for students all of those sorts of things seem to me that now is not the time to reduce the hours of professional development that we need more And so I quarrel with that reduction but I would grudgingly hold my nose and probably vote for it The health insurance rates for school employees have been rising for several years because of a lack of funding from the state and local school districts Also a million catastrophic claims fund was wiped out by five claims in and that each totaled more than million The Legislature this year appropriated million for the program In September Bob Alexander director of the Employee Benefits Division told a legislative committee it would take million in new money to keep premium rates at current levels next year As lawmakers considered ways to hold down premium increases officials earlier this month pushed back the enrollment period for employees covered by the health insurance plan from Oct to Nov The health insurance system told the governor it needed some direction by Tuesday so that it could begin preparing material for the sign up period The board met Tuesday and voted to begin the process of printing up materials based on the proposal now being considered by lawmakers In discussing the late addition of the proposal to repeal Act Beebe said that was added because the federal Environmental Protection Agency had complained and said it would begin reviewing all water permits",0

The trustees will have to decide what to do, and how to tell members. Members and trustees will be angry or upset that despite all the advice the funds are paying for they can end up in such a bind. The actuaries will point out how there is now a bigger hole in the pension fund They may permit themselves the luxury of explaining that over the past year uncharacteristically if the fund had been more fully invested in government bonds it would have done a lot better Unfortunately you cannot be sure of paying rising pensions that go up with increased lifespans and with wage inflation out of fixed income bonds The investment advisers will probably have some figures to show they did not do too badly taking cover in relative performance figures showing the trustees could have lost more if they had been with someone else or in something worse Many will be able to say they were not responsible for the main cause of the loss They did what they were asked or followed an asset allocation laid down by someone else If the trustees have the temerity to ask why they have lost so much money the professional advisers are likely to point the finger back Trustees they will say make the overall asset allocation decision how much will be in equities and how much in cash and they chose the specialist investment managers to carry it all out The trustees will be left pondering why they spent a small fortune in fees yet lacked the advice on the one thing that really matters how much to have in cash how much in bonds and how much in shares They paid the piper but ended up singing the song themselves At this point all eyes will turn to the sponsoring company representatives They will be expected to make up another black hole in the pension fund They are likely to report that prospects for the company have taken several turns for the worst and it hopes the fund can manage with less as it is laying people off and strapped for cash It wants the trustees to invest the company s contributions better to cut the need to drain the company of more cash that it needs to safeguard jobs and invest in the future Meanwhile the members will be worried whether they have the right people standing up for their interests and should the trustees be tougher with those who have managed to help the fund lose so much money Members should think about going to the next meeting to show their concern and to ask some questions about what is going to be done to try to put it right Turning up may strengthen the resolve of the trustees to take some action So what is the way out of this bind The first thing trustees can do is to ask themselves how much active management of their shares is costing them In most cases it is significant money If a pounds m equity portfolio underperforms the index by pc after expenses and I have seen some which have that is a massive pounds m a year This cost could be largely spared by investing the equity portfolio in tracker funds such as Exchange Traded Funds which can save the fund hundreds of thousands of pounds The trustees could then afford some asset allocation advice which would cost considerably less than the average losses on active management If the advice is any good it could spare them some of the losses that come from staying too fully invested in bad times like It also gives them the comfort of knowing they have taken proper advice for the most important decisions I have been a pension trustee so I know how difficult it can be to get change in a pension fund It is not going to be easy explaining large losses to members or to sponsoring companies Maybe it is time trustees made their task easier by taking some advice and cutting management costs John Redwood MP is chairman of Evercore Pan Asset asset allocation advisers www pan asset com",0

Despite a period of lacklustre earnings growth UK listed BT Group s share price has continued its well established track record of outperforming the broader market After a solid third quarter result and re entry to consumer wireless services we have increased confidence that BT Group is on the cusp of above average earnings growth BT the holding company that owns British Telecommunications recently bought mobile phone network EE having exited the consumer wireless services market more than a decade ago Looking first at BT Group s third quarter results the company delivered a strong set of numbers with the key feature being a per cent increase in adjusted earnings per share Encouragingly for investors the strong growth in adjusted earnings per share was driven primarily by a combination of revenue growth the containment of adjusted operating cost growth to per cent a per cent decline in depreciation amortisation expenses and lower interest costs Looking at revenue performance a key point to note is that the reported growth of per cent represents the company s highest run rate in more than seven years Further the key driver of BT Group s revenue performance was due almost entirely to the company s consumer segment which reported an per cent increase in revenue on the back of a per cent increase in average revenue per user While by no means a blockbuster it was also encouraging to note that cash flow performance was broadly in line with adjusted earnings As has been the case in recent years robust cash generation has enabled BT to continue investing in its business while undertaking capital management initiatives BT spent million billion on capital investments during the third quarter compared with million in the previous corresponding period and is on track for million of share buybacks in the financial year The company also delivered further balance sheet improvements with net debt of billion at December around million lower than March While we expect this underlying trend to continue the acquisition of EE late last month will significantly alter BT Group s capital position with the price tag of billion to be funded through a combination of cash new debt and equity In terms of the outlook management has stated that it expects BT s underlying revenues to grow by per cent for the full year with modest growth in adjusted underlying earnings and normalised free cash flows of around billion This will allow the company to boost dividends per share by per cent as well as completing share buybacks BT Group s third quarter results provide further evidence that earnings are on an upward trajectory While management s guidance for modest earnings growth is unchanged despite solid third quarter results recent business initiatives look to be setting the company up for a period of above average growth In this context the shares appear attractive with a prospective price earnings multiple of around times and a per cent yield Disclosure interests associated with Fat Prophets declare a holding in BT Group",0

* Second homeowners in Wales will see council tax rise up to 300 per cent Average house price in Pembrokeshire has risen per cent in the past year A clampdown on second homeowners has been announced by the Welsh Government in a move that could lead to similar measures elsewhere in Britain Wales is tripling the maximum amount of council tax that such homeowners can be charged amid concerns that holiday home demand is driving house prices up rapidly The cap is being raised from its current level of per cent an amount that was paid on more than second homes and long term empty properties The new level of per cent will be applied from April next year with individual councils deciding the exact level and how close they come to that cap The announcement follows the growing popularity of rural or coastal areas in Wales such as Pembrokeshire and the Brecon Beacons These areas have always offered appealing countryside but that took on a new appeal amid the pandemic when people craved more rural space The location even became one of the most favoured destinations for Londoners seeking a second home This helped to push up house prices with average values in Pembrokeshire increasing per cent during the past year to reach according to property website Zoopla The Welsh Government said the new levels of council tax would help restrict second homeowners and address unaffordable housing facing some communities in Wales However experts warned that the measures could end up restricting the supply or property and pushing up values even higher North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf said The Welsh Government s proposals at first glance appear laudable Any policy which seeks to make more properties available to purchase for local people at affordable prices should be welcomed For too long prices in picturesque Wales have likely been inflated by second home owners and those seeking to let their properties for holidaymakers many from London and other major cities which has pushed them even further beyond the reach of locals However markets never work as simply as that and the Welsh Government needs to be careful it isn t creating a larger problem if the change contributes to a reduction in supply pushing property prices even higher It follows upmarket seaside town Southwold cracking down on holiday and second homes over fears it s becoming a ghost town with all new build dwellings now having to be occupied as someone s main home Are empty homes a big problem In England there are hundreds of thousand of homes being left empty for more than six months In total these have reached more than properties with some being owned by second homeowners who are only using them for part of the year Lettings body Propertymark says action is needed to bring these homes back into use to help ease pressure on existing housing stock and help improve local communities It also says that an increasing number of short term holiday lets in certain parts of England are reducing the number of much needed homes to rent and buy Propertymark is renewing its call for the UK Government to introduce measures to reduce the number of empty homes It has welcomed the measures outlined in the Levelling Up White Paper to address the issue These include restarting the Empty Homes Community Grants Programme that was in place until Propertymark also said many councils require a speedier process for obtaining compulsory purchase orders on long term empty homes It suggested homes are sometimes left empty due to the death of the owner and complications over inheritance For example if a property is jointly inherited it can take time for all parties to agree what to do with it Alternatively an owner may have previously rented a property that now requires improvement work Sometimes the owners may not be able to afford the work or they decide to walk away from the properties for reasons only known to them and let them to fall into a state of disrepair Propertymark also acknowledged that in some areas of the country there are second homeowners who only use the properties for occasional holidays And some overseas owners buy investment properties in cities such as London but choose not to rent them at a time when the housing market is in the grip of unsustainably low levels of stock for sale and for rent it makes no sense that there are thousands of homes sitting vacant These landlords may be relying on capital growth rather than any rental income from their properties Recent research carried out exclusively for MailOnline Property and ThisIsMoney found that some landlords have been hit so hard by recent property tax rises that they end up with as little as a year profit based on investing in an averagely priced property Timothy Douglas of Propertymark said Empty homes are a wasted resource and at a time when the housing market is in the grip of unsustainably low levels of stock for sale and for rent it makes no sense that there are thousands of homes sitting vacant We have long called for the reintroduction of a national programme of funding because of the much needed incentive that it can provide to get these properties back into the market for would be home buyers or landlords The UK Government has set itself a target of building new houses a year but it must not miss opportunities to do more to better manage the growing level of existing housing stock that is currently being underused or not used at all",0

It is accepted business practice that companies operate by using bank accounts into which turnover is paid in and salaries and sundries paid out. So do charities and trade unions, as do stockbrokers, fund managers, insurance companies, IFAs and all other professionals and traders. Without the use of client accounts the wheels of business be it trading companies or financial and professional services firms could not turn And so it is with Sipps A cash account is opened for the client into which contributions transfers and investment income is received and from which investments benefits and expenses are paid The operation of these accounts is therefore a crucial part of the administration process and is why providers can become obsessive over their organisation and supervision It is very important to stress that Sipp cash accounts are not some sort of rip off imposed on the client as a way of extracting undisclosed earnings but are an essential part of the way the products function Without them Sipps would not exist Furthermore Sipp cash accounts are simply a conduit through which cash flows for the reasons mentioned above and customers are not forced to leave money in these accounts Although a client account may have a large balance for each individual client their cash holding is usually small There are two ways to operate Sipp cash accounts each with merits and disadvantages Joint signatories A separate bank account can be opened for each Sipp client with the provider s bank The member and provider are joint signatories although the provider usually holds the chequebook This way the member feels in total control of their Sipp because no transactions can be made without their signature or joint authorisation However cumbersome administration is a drawback The adviser has to request a payment so that the provider can then write a cheque and send it to the adviser who sends it to the client to sign and return or send directly to the provider to countersign and issue By this time the investment opportunity could have been missed Another drawback is that accounts like this are harder to reconcile for HMRC and FSA reporting purposes often leading to higher fees Pooled client accounts Here all client cash is managed through one client account operated by the provider However there are worries that mistakes might happen and funds for one client being used by another But they are administered using state of the art banking systems and are reconciled regularly The pooled client account approach allows much slicker processing of transactions which keeps providers fees down and assists with the provision of online bank statements Security In the wake of the banking crisis one of the more frequently asked questions has been how safe is my Sipp As far as the cash deposits are concerned the answer is as safe as they can be There are two areas of concern one is internal mistakes or fraud and the other is the risk of the bank itself failing Segregation of duties is extremely important so that the person requesting checking and authorising a payment is not the same and that a clear audit and reconciliation process is followed Bank failure is out of the Sipp provider s control although Sipps are covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme to the tune of GBP each including each individual Sipp cash in a pooled client accounts The beauty of Sipps as a savings product is that they allow investment into a huge spectrum of alternative options This means that Sipp cash does not have to be held in the main account and only for the through flow of funds Any customer wanting to hold a significant cash deposit or for a significant period of time can use an external deposit account at another bank The Sipp provider must of course be a signatory to the account and sign the application When funds are withdrawn they must be returned to the main provider s account So the Sipp holder has a huge range of deposit types banks interest rates options and currencies at his disposal There are restrictions as some bank accounts are not permitted to hold pension fund money and some offshore accounts may be beyond the realms of acceptable risk under the bank s duty of care to the customer but even so the self invest principle of Sipps applies as much to cash as it does to other assets Or at least it does for most Sipp providers Interest Interest paid on cash deposits is a hot topic These days this does not amount to much but Sipp providers are still subject to close scrutiny and more so than stockbrokers and fund managers it should be noted The tendency is for the provider s account to pay a low rate as it represents through flow money whereas external deposits compete for the highest rate Some Sipp providers pay tiered interest on their account depending on the amount the customer has on deposit with them although even in those cases higher rates are usually available from external deposits To manage risk and also for due diligence reasons some providers limit themselves to a panel of external deposit accounts Of course just like companies stockbrokers fund managers and the like Sipp providers can earn interest from the cash held on deposit by their customers This has long been a source of income for these firms There was a time when bank base rates were around the per cent level or higher that providers could pay their clients interest at a fixed level below base per cent below for example but negotiate a higher rate with the bank based on the total amount they held on deposit and keep the difference At one time this accounted for up to per cent of some Sipp providers income Those days are now long gone with base rates so low both customer and provider receives next to nothing Some providers that do not earn interest charge higher fees to compensate a point an adviser always needs to consider when selecting a Sipp provider Disclosure On the February the FSA published a consultation paper entitled Product Disclosure Retail Investments Changes to Reflect RDR Adviser Charging and to Improve Pension Scheme Disclosure This covers Sipps extensively and proposes a change to their Conduct of Business rulebook requiring Sipp providers to disclose any commissions or retained bank interest on their fee schedules This proposal prompts two reactions First disclosure that interest is earned has been carried out by the majority of Sipp providers for some time now The FSA has given previous guidance on the subject to which the Sipp industry has taken collective notice and amended its practice accordingly The proposals in the consultation document therefore seem a little out of date The second reaction is that what the FSA is requesting may not actually be possible As mentioned above the way Sipp providers operate just like other businesses is to agree a rate of interest with the bank based on the total amount held in client accounts The provider may even use some of this to place treasury deposits earning different levels of interest at different times based on the prevailing deposit rates available These deposits could even be with other banks which was a useful method of trying to spread risk during the banking crisis What this means is that the amount of any interest retained by the Sipp provider can fluctuate constantly and also has no direct correlation with the amount of cash the underlying client is holding at any given time Surely simply explaining clearly to the client that the provider can retain interest earned over and above the amount paid to the customer and making external deposits available as an investment option is enough So the apparently simple topic of cash and Sipps is far from simple when looked at closely However the use of cash accounts is as integral to Sipps as it is to all other financial instruments and business operations and will continue to be We therefore need to understand and embrace the fundamentals but there can be a tendency to expect the impossible where cash is concerned Tim Sargisson is managing director of IFG Financial Services",0

"YOUR MONEY

There are pros and cons of having your current account and mortgage with the same lender.","YOUR MONEY

There are pros and cons of having your current account and mortgage with the same lender. Esther Shaw reports WHEN it comes to taking out a new mortgage loan or savings account the adage is that it pays to shop around However there are now several providers who are bundling two or more products together and offering preferential rates to customers who take out the whole package For example if you sign up for a bank s current account you may get a better rate on your mortgage While bundling is already common practice on the Continent this trend has to date been far less prevalent here in the UK But that could be about to change according to Michael White from mortgage website Email Mortgages This sort of arrangement does seem to be in its infancy says White But it is growing in popularity and we would expect other providers to start bundling Abbey has begun offering through a limited number of distributors a switcher product range that bundles together a mortgage and a current account The offer is a per cent reduction on the mortgage rate for those borrowers taking out their main personal bank account with Abbey says White This means that for a two year fixed rate deal up to per cent loan to value LTV Abbey will offer a rate of per cent for those who take out its bank account This compares to a rate of per cent for those who don t For a two year deal with a slightly higher LTV of per cent the rate is per cent for those who take out an Abbey bank account and for those who do not If you re looking for a new mortgage you may be tempted by the Abbey deal but it s crucial that you do your research before signing on the dotted line The Abbey approach is an interesting one says Andrew Hagger from price comparison service Moneynet co uk However I m not convinced that many customers will want to go through the hassle of switching their bank account at the same time that they are moving house or buying a new home When you take on a new home you will for example have a whole set of new standing orders and direct debits which need to be set up such as your mortgage council tax and utility bills Buying a house is stressful enough let alone trying to switch your bank account at the same time says Hagger White adds that potential customers need to do their sums The savings would need to be substantial for customers to consider moving their bank account because of the perception of the hassle involved he says Elsewhere within its stable of products Abbey is offering a rate of per cent on a regular saver account the Super Fixed Rate Monthly Saver Issue to customers who open one of its current or packaged accounts Abbey is also offering a Super Direct Cash individual savings account Isa Issue paying per cent if you invest the same amount in a qualifying investment product Hagger says This could be either an equity based investment or a pension product HSBC is offering a deal that current account products enabling customers who hold one of its packaged Plus accounts to qualify for a per cent discount on its standard mortgages But you do have to pay a monthly fee of for this account and sign for a minimum of months says Hagger From time to time custom also have the opportunity to for a regular saver account at a a preferential rate and if you take loan for two years or more and let it run its course HSBC will refund per cent of the interest paid NatWest also offers a bundled mortgage and bank account deal White says This is similar to the Abbey deal offering a per cent reduction on the mortgage rate if the customer takes out a NatWest account As a bonus NatWest also reduce the application fee for the mortgage from to The Co op also offers better mortgage rates for current account customers and Privilege customers Warning to handle packages with care WHILE bundled deals may appear attractive consumers are urged to approach such offers with care Bundled deals can sometimes be a regressive move warns Mark Harris from mortgage broker Savills Private Finance You only have to look at the compulsory insurance products of the s that would get you a better rate to see that bundling is not always in the consumer s best interests Hagger says providers are relying on consumer apathy Lenders may be banking on the fact that some customers would perhaps find it more convenient to have all their eggs in one basket and es p eciall y if the y are not rate conscious he says Packaging products is preying on customers who don t shop around But while this may seem more convenient in the majority of cases this will mean consumers are not getting the best deals The idea of bundling is a good one adds Hagger But in reality it s hard to find one provider that is the best across a range of personal finance product areas This is a view shared by Harris Bundling makes the comparison process more difficult he says As a consumer you should choose products on an individual basis and select the best one for you It pays to sho p around Beware marketing tactics FOR many banks and building societies existing and trusted customers are the prime target for cross selling other products the key product is the current account Once a provider has you as a current account customer you are unlikely to switch away unless you receive poor service says Andrew Hagger at Moneynet The current account is a gateway that allows the bank to understand your spending habits This can make it easier for them to sell you lucrative pension and investment products Banks may also offer preferential rates on loans and mortgages to their own customers because they regard them as lower risk Some lenders offer existing customers slightly better deals because they have immediate access to the customer s account information says Louise Holmes from financial analyst Moneyfacts This means the bank or building society can carry out all manner of checks quickly and easily from general account management to money laundering With borrowing down in the current uncertain climate lenders are also looking for new ways to claw back lost revenue Bundling is becoming more common as lenders seek to maximise revenue says Mark Harris from Savills Private Finance",0

Dear Dan, During a recent trip to Los Angeles I stopped by a coffee shop offering a very expensive coffee called kopi luwak or civet coffee I asked about the steep price and the barista told me the story of the special process required to make this coffee A catlike Indonesian animal known as a civet eats coffee cherries and then poops out what are basically beans People then collect these processed beans and use them to make a highly unusual brew that is said to be smoother than its journey It can sell for hundreds of dollars per pound I was curious but not interested or brave enough to buy it let alone drink it Can you explain why people are willing to pay for this Chahriar First I think you made a mistake You should have paid up and tried a cup in part because you are still clearly curious about it in part because it would have made a much better story and what are a few dollars compared with a good story So the next time you pass by a coffee place with kopi luwak try it maybe even get the double shot with hair and all the trimmings As for civet coffee s quality The promotional material that I found says that civets know how to pick the best coffee beans and that their digestive systems ferment the beans reducing their acidity and providing a much better coffee I have no idea how this works but the story piqued my curiosity too So why are people willing to pay so much for civet coffee It is probably for the novelty and the story and because the amount and type of labor involved is clearly so much higher than for your average cup of Java People are generally willing to pay more for something that requires more effort to produce even if the product itself isn t better and civet coffee sounds like a prime example of this effort based pricing principle Finally I wonder how much people would be willing to pay had the beans passed through an American human rather than an exotic Indonesian animal My guess That would be too strong a brew for any of us Dear Dan Are financial advisers a wise investment Mine charges me each year for all my assets under their management Is it worth it Allan It is hard to know for sure But the fact that many financial advisers have different hidden fees suggests to me that they themselves don t think that people would pay if they charged for their services in a clear and upfront way To help you think about this question in your own life let s contrast two cases In case one you are charged of your assets under management and this amount is taken directly from your brokerage account once a month In case two you pay the same overall amount but you send a monthly check to your financial adviser The second case more directly and clearly depicts the cost of your financial adviser providing a better frame for your question So put yourself in the mind set of the second case and ask yourself if you would pay directly for these services If the answer is yes keep your financial adviser if the answer is no you have your first action plan for the New Year Dear Dan Every year when Christmas comes I feel an obligation to send Christmas cards to everyone I know and every year the number of cards I send gets larger It is now officially getting out of hand May I switch to sending cards only to my really close friends Holly It is fine to send cards only to your good friends I don t think anyone left off the list would be offended and you would also reduce their feeling of obligation to send you a card next year And if you really want to eliminate the Christmas card frenzy there is always Judaism Have a dilemma for Dan Email AskAriely wsj com END Dow Jones Newswires December ET GMT",0

"It's March, and that means the weather - and the real estate market - is getting hotter. Rising interest rates and a seasonal feeding frenzy have created significantly more demand for homes than the number of homes that are actually for sale, but all markets turn eventually: regardless, it is clear that now is one of the best times in history in which to sell a home.

A great market environment doesn't make it any easier to sell a home, of course. It just makes it easier to find good buyers faster. Appraisal concerns brought on by rapidly rising prices, competition from new home builders, and a worldwide pandemic all create a specific set of challenges that can be tricky to navigate - but the payoffs can be huge.","It's March, and that means the weather - and the real estate market - is getting hotter.

The once-cozy relationship between Enron Corp. and its auditor blew up
in a storm of recriminations yesterday amid questions about what
Andersen should have done about questionable practices at the energy
company.



Enron's board fired its longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. While
it said it wanted to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt during the
investigation, ""we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent
events, including the reported destruction of documents by Andersen
personnel and the disciplinary actions taken against several of
Andersen's partners working in its Houston office.""

The once-cozy relationship between Enron Corp. and its auditor blew up
in a storm of recriminations yesterday amid questions about what
Andersen should have done about questionable practices at the energy
company.



Enron's board fired its longtime auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP. While
it said it wanted to give Andersen the benefit of the doubt during the
investigation, ""we can't afford to wait any longer in light of recent
events, including the reported destruction of documents by Andersen
personnel and the disciplinary actions taken against several of
Andersen's partners working in its Houston office.""
 In a statement released later Andersen fired back As a matter of fact our relationship with Enron ended when the company s business failed and it went into bankruptcy Andersen is committed to continuing to address the issues related to the collapse of Enron in a forthright and candid manner The move by Enron previously one of Andersen s biggest clients comes as the spotlight of the investigation has shifted to Andersen In addition to the firm s destruction of documents Andersen has come under fire for signing off on accounting practices related to partnerships with which Enron did business The partnerships allowed Enron to keep debt off its balance sheet Yesterday yet another internal Andersen memo was released by congressional investigators concerning Andersen discussions of the Enron partnerships Enron s publicly filed financial statements included references to the partnerships going back to meaning Andersen was long aware of at least some of Enron s accounting issues The newly released memos show that in February Andersen executives held what one executive called significant discussions about conflicts related to the partnerships and myriad other issues that eventually contributed to Enron s collapse The question that Andersen now faces is What should it have done differently Accounting and corporate governance specialists say it should have done more but that it didn t is typical Until late in the game for Enron just a month before it filed for bankruptcy court protection Andersen did what most accounting firms do when up against an important client with aggressive accounting practices It stuck by its client The earliest known Andersen memo referencing accounting issues at Enron is a Feb e mail that summed up a meeting in which senior Andersen partners in Houston and in its Chicago headquarters discussed if they should keep Enron as a client In that memo an Andersen auditor laid out nearly every accounting issue that would later play a role in Enron s collapse But the participants in the meeting decided that Andersen had the appropriate people and processes in place to serve Enron and manage our engagement risks The memo cites the large fees million a year at some point in the future that Enron a million in fees client in was expected to generate It is rare that big accounting firms ditch clients There is almost no turnover among Fortune companies and their accountants they seem merged at the hip says Dan Goldwasser a lawyer with Vedder Price Kaufman Kammholz in New York Does it bother me I guess it does Andersen had audited Enron since the energy company was formed in a merger In a separate statement released yesterday Andersen said Nothing in the February meeting or the memo summarizing it indicated that any illegal actions or improper accounting was suspected It said the reference to million in fees was not in the context of the firm s desire to grow revenues but whether the large fees would be wrongly perceived as compromising it Andersen s statement added it wasn t until August when a whistle blower surfaced at Enron that we became aware that individuals within Enron believed that there may have been accounting improprieties The statement doesn t elaborate on what Andersen did over the next several months Congressional investigators also released an Aug memo which summarizes a conversation between an Andersen audit partner who wasn t on the Enron account and Sherron Watkins the Enron whistleblower outlining her concerns about Enron s accounting Ms Watkins one of several Andersen auditors who had gone to work for Enron in particular expressed worries about the partnerships and then Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow s involvement in them The partner passed that information on to several Enron auditors at Andersen and to the firm s lawyers according to the memo More information about what Andersen knew could come out soon Congressional investigators received two new boxes of documents from Andersen yesterday including copies of destroyed documents recovered from Andersen s computer systems The boxes contain mostly e mail mainly from David Duncan Andersen s lead auditor on the Enron assignment until he was fired Tuesday Congressional investigators plan to meet today with Richard Causey Enron s longtime chief accounting officer and a former Andersen auditor Some observers argue that given all the questions surrounding the partnerships Andersen should have voiced concerns to the audit committee of Enron s board earlier than it apparently did Nov Basically they have an obligation to go to the board of directors particularly the audit committee of the board when they come up with anything suspicious or anything controversial or anything that could have been a potential problem says John Nash president emeritus of the National Association of Corporate Directors Unraveling Andersen s Involvement Some of the events that came to light recently involving Enron auditor Arthur Andersen Feb Arthur Andersen officials discuss Enron s aggressive accounting practices and potential conflicts of interest at a meeting to decide whether to retain the energy trading company as a client An internal memo drafted Feb recounts the executives discussion of many of the alleged problems that have become the focus of investigations into Enron s collapse The memo was addressed to two Andersen officials including David Duncan who headed the Enron account August Enron Vice President Sherron Watkins a former Andersen employee writes anonymously to Chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay with concerns about potential conflicts of interest and accounting practices Aug Date of according to a second memo by another Andersen executive a phone conversation between Watkins and an Andersen employee who relays the issues to senior Andersen management including Duncan Fall Vinson Elkins Enron s law firm conducts a preliminary investigation into Watkins s charges Oct E mail by in house Andersen lawyer Nancy Temple reminds risk management partner Michael Odom of document and retention policy Temple later tells Andersen that she intended to refer only to work in progress Dec Enron files for bankruptcy court protection Investigators focus on Andersen s role Jan Andersen discloses to investigators that a significant but undetermined number of documents relating to the Enron audit had been destroyed in recent months Jan Andersen fires Duncan saying that he led an expedited effort to destroy documents after he learned that Enron had received a request for information from the SEC about its financial accounting and reporting Jan Duncan is questioned by the House Energy and Commerce Committee and the Justice Department mostly about the February memo Duncan tells the investigators he called the February meeting because he was aware the Enron account posed significant risk according to one person present during the questioning Jan Enron fires

THE police officer jailed for killing Dalian Atkinson should lose his pension, says the soccer star's girlfriend. Benjamin Monk who earned up to a year was on full pay for five years before he was convicted of manslaughter Former Aston Villa striker Dalian died after Pc Monk tasered him for seconds and kicked him in the head twice Atkinson s partner Karen Wright said Of course he should lose his police pension He has seriously undermined confidence in the police and he s killed a man on duty On each of the five Christmases we ve had since Dalian died I ve thought about Monk doing his Christmas shopping She added Had he been honest about his actions he d have pleaded guilty to manslaughter and now been handed a shorter prison sentence Atkinson was tasered when police were called to a disturbance at his dad s home in Telford Shropshire in August Birmingham crown court heard after using his Taser Monk kicked Dalian s head like a football Monk was cleared of murder but convicted of manslaughter and jailed for eight years He is the first British police officer in years to be found guilty of unlawful killing while on duty The court heard Monk had been allowed to keep his job with West Mercia Police in despite being found guilty of gross misconduct He had failed to reveal cautions for theft and being drunk when he applied for his post in Miss Wright who met Atkinson when she was and rekindled their relationship in said that he felt hounded by police throughout his life She added The police have been very kind to Pc Monk After Dalian s death and before he was charged they kept faith with him allowing him to carry on work with light duties We now know they had previously let him stay in the force following a finding of gross misconduct Their faith in him has ended up costing Dalian his life and the police a lot of money as his dishonesty meant a lengthy trial Police officers can be made to forfeit their pensions if they are convicted of a criminal offence which could lead to a serious loss of confidence in the force West Mercia Police said Monk was suspended on full pay after Atkinson s death but in was handed a suitable non frontline role on restricted duties In he was charged and suspended again A police spokesman added Pc Monk is now subject of a misconduct process City protest over sentence A RALLY is to take place on Friday in Birmingham s Victoria Square to protest over the sentence handed to Pc Benjamin Monk who killed Dalian Atkinson Birmingham community activist Desmond Jaddoo said This is about justice If people care about justice they will turn up The black community is outraged because clearly they feel the sentence does not reflect the violence Dalian Atkinson was subjected to Too much leniency was shown to a police officer who was out of control He tasered Atkinson for over five times the recommended period and he hit him in the head when he fell to the floor Let us not forget there have been other issues involving the black community particularly during Covid An online petition states It is anticipated that Pc Monk will be eligible for parole after serving five years To say there has been outrage from all parts of society at this apparently lenient sentence is an understatement As such we call upon the Ministry of Justice to urgently review this sentence with a view to increasing it to at least a minimum years",0

Today there are fewer than members and the post is facing mounting financial troubles that include a pending foreclosure on the property According to Bowling the main problems plaguing Post are an aging membership a lack of young new members and dwindling community support Just a few years ago we had a lot more members than we have now he said They members are getting older you know dying off And the new people just getting out of the service now are not joining and it s not just here it s all over the country Post currently has members according to the commander Membership dues are annually Bowling said and of that goes to the Kentucky American Legion organization The Legion does rent out its hall for whatever people want to use it for as long as it s legal Membership is not the only thing declining Business is dying off We haven t had the business he said You ve got to come in and patronize the place Sylvia Wibberg is the finance officer for Post which in recent years has not been an easy task The post is about behind on its mortgage and the lender is in the process of filing foreclosure papers she said It s been lingering out there for some time Wibberg said We ve tried to keep up with the payments as best we could and we just got to where we couldn t do it anymore In addition the organization has monthly bills of about she said when everything from utilities payroll liquor and entertainment expense is factored in The post is also behind on federal withholding payroll taxes The post has had to curtail other expenses according to the finance officer Well at one time we donated to the Paducah Cooperative Ministry located across the street Wibberg said Every month we gave them and when things started going down that had to stop And then people who would come in off the street veterans who were short of cash we ve helped them But we re at the point where we can t do that any more According to Wibberg the post has not renewed its listing with a Realtor which recently expired and an auction of the property may be the next move We would have to go smaller building she said It would be an advantage to be able to rent than to buy Bowling agrees We need to sell the building and get to something smaller he said According to John Raughter a spokesman for the national American Legion in Indianapolis the organization remains strong today although some posts are experiencing challenges such as the one facing Post Some posts are struggling he said Sometimes it s better for them to consolidate There may be another post in the community that has a little bit stronger membership base so sometimes by combining their efforts they can be more effective Raughter said sometimes it takes a while for people in military service to realize they re veterans I did not know it when I was in the Marine Corps he said I remember thinking you re not really a veteran until you get out of service You re eligible for Legion membership from the moment you leave for basic training The Legion stresses service first and membership second Raughter said The organization is involved in a number of activities to support the community whether it be a blood drive hurricane relief or its many youth programs and scholarships The current period of eligibility for Legion membership dates back to Aug the day Iraq invaded Kuwait which kicked off the first Gulf War Raughter said We ve never had a window that long in the history of the American Legion and it s never closed he said So basically no matter where you served in the American Legion you could have been in California you could have been in Iraq you re eligible for membership as long as you had that one day of federal active duty And that includes the National Guard and Reserve members who have been called up for active duty on federal orders While it is true that many older veterans who are Legion members are dying when you look at the Guard members and reservists who were deployed during Iraq and Afghanistan and things like natural disaster assistance there s an awful lot of veterans eligible for the Legion he said And even if they don t join today we do believe that over time they re going to see the value of having a friend in Washington a friend in their communities and even in the statehouse in Kentucky to bring to the attention of legislators and the governor ways they can assist veterans and their families",0

The revelation that Alberta Investment Management Corp., known as AIMCo, suffered a $4-billion loss betting against volatility in financial markets deserves far more explanation than offered by either so far, given its important public policy role. This is not about the drop in overall asset value that has hit nearly all major investors since COVID disrupted global markets in early March To be sure the Edmonton based Crown corporation has been hit that way too The key issues are the high risk strategy AIMCo employed on behalf of its clients and how losses piled up without anyone pushing the ejector seat button Checks and balances apparently failed As a result you can bet it has been anything but business as usual among top executives and board members at AIMCo after a strategy it had previously employed with success suddenly blew up Yet Mr Kenney in his first public comments on the debacle on Wednesday said essentially that things are tough all over given the unprecedented turmoil in financial markets AIMCo chief executive officer Kevin Uebelein has been silent This doesn t cut it AIMCo plays a critical role in the province s economy It is the manager of billion of public sector pension funds and big chunks of the public purse notably the billion Heritage Savings Trust Fund the rainy day fund built long ago from a portion of oil and gas revenues The government does not direct its investment strategies but as owner it certainly has overseer responsibilities It is also sketching out AIMCo s expansion AIMCo has said it has been transparent in keeping its pension fund clients apprised of its travails as they worsened which is true Indeed much of The Globe and Mail s reporting in recent days has been based on interviews with officials associated with those organizations and who have been taken aback by the magnitude of the losses from sophisticated derivative trading Some of the losses are said to have been realized and some could still be recouped It s an uncomfortable conversation for them to have with their plan members who are already on edge as the economy sputters and worries about the contagion and job security linger How is it possible for Jason Kenney to be so right and so wrong in response to pandemic Alberta s Heritage fund hit hard by AIMCo s bad bet in March April Alberta s largest labour organization questions use of pension funds to support energy industry But aren t all Albertans ostensibly clients too as beneficiaries of the public accounts that AIMCo manages It explained this week that it does not discuss the performance of specific investment strategies outside its regular disclosures If AIMCo was a publicly traded company it would have to issue a special news release to disclose any material event that could have a major impact on the corporation and its shareholders This is nothing if not material It s weirdly tempting to play down the size of the loss in the context of a billion portfolio But here s some perspective billion could have bought all the shares in Alberta based WestJet Airlines last year for the price Onex Corp paid and there would have been million left over Mr Kenney has much at stake with AIMCo His United Conservative Party government has already passed legislation that forces the province s teachers to shift their retirement funds to AIMCo from their own manager The teachers union has staunchly opposed the move arguing that its members have been well served by the Alberta Teachers Retirement Fund which has been in charge of their pensions for years The transition is not due to be completed until the end of so the teachers are not affected by AIMCo s loss Unsurprisingly though it has reignited their opposition big time as they question how much risk they may be exposed to without having a say in investment decisions The Premier has also used AIMCo as a political cudgel As part of the tension with Ottawa that has shaped much of his year in power the UCP will study pulling Alberta out of the Canada Pension Plan to have AIMCo manage the money instead As his argument goes Albertans could enjoy lower premiums and keep returns within the province Now regardless of the current global crisis unexplained trading losses and murky risk criteria do nothing to build confidence among citizens that entrusting AIMCo with much more of their money is a wise move Your time is valuable Have the Top Business Headlines newsletter conveniently delivered to your inbox in the morning or evening Sign up today Follow this link to view this story on globeandmail com AIMCo s billion debacle strikes a blow to public confidence The viewing of this article is only available to Globe Unlimited subscribers The Globe and Mail",0

SKANDIA has caused a stir among investors by taking a ""dream team"" approach to the fund industry this year. Just as Chelsea under Jose Mourinho have bought some of the best footballing talent and moulded the stars into a winning team so Skandia aims to bring together top managers to use their skills to produce two all conquering best ideas funds Both the UK and the global funds are multimanager vehicles so that each manager is responsible for a mini fund of ten stocks There is no argument that Skandia s players are among the best in the industry On the UK side managers such as Ashton Bradbury of Old Mutual Anthony Nutt of Jupiter and Roger Whiteoak of AXA Framlington consistently top the performance tables The same goes for Hugh Young of Aberdeen and Tom Walker of Martin Currie on the global side But can these talented individuals produce a winning blend Mark Dampier of Hargreaves Lansdown the independent financial adviser is sufficiently convinced to put some of his own money into the funds He says Many of the managers Skandia has signed are those we would recommend individually They won t physically be working together because they are from different investment stables but so long as each produces enough good stockpicking ideas the fund as a whole will prosper Skandia has ensured that the managers complement each other well Roger Whiteoak will trawl the smaller companies and Richard Buxton of Schroders will focus on large and mid cap stocks Tony Nutt is an income manager and Richard Plackett of Merrill Lynch will hunt down special situations stocks The fund managers themselves are enthusiastic about this and have been queueing up to be included The managers have a big incentive to do well because they will not want the embarrassment of being thrown off the team and there are plenty of substitutes on the bench awaiting their chance Mick Gilligan of Killik Co the stockbroker says that managers will welcome the flexibility that the funds provide He says The successful funds they already run may be growing uncomfortably large and becoming padded out with a tail of unexciting stocks It is also difficult for a large fund to build up significant holdings in smaller companies With the new funds which are still quite small they have greater freedom to buy what they want All the expertise does not come cheap but investors will not be disappointed by the performance of the Global Best Ideas fund Figures from Trustnet the fund research group show that it has returned per cent since its launch in June putting it fourth out of the funds in its sector Meanwhile Rensburg the successful investment boutique has launched its own version of a best ideas fund The UK Managers Focus Trust combines the home grown talents of Rensburg s Paul Spencer Colin Morton Stuart Sharp and Mark Hall c Times Newspapers Ltd",0

"Rima Haddad looks at how exchange-traded products can fit into a scheme portfolio

At a glance","Rima Haddad looks at how exchange-traded products can fit into a scheme portfolio

At a glance In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn globally as at the end of October The increasing use of ETPs is part of the growth in passive investing The UK pensions market has been significantly affected by regulatory reforms There are a couple of themes at the core of these reforms that are particularly relevant in the context of this article Costs and performance Transparency Liquidity We will briefly consider why exchange traded products ETPs are a relevant investment tool for trustees and advisers to consider when evaluating investment strategies with a particular emphasis on costs and performance In ETP assets surpassed those held by hedge funds for the first time standing at just over trn trn globally as at the end of October This represents a year compound annual growth rate of ETPs are open ended investment vehicles that generally track an underlying benchmark and are listed on an exchange ETPs are transparent instruments to the extent that index and product holdings are openly published Additionally as they are exchange traded prices are quoted intraday providing both transparent price discovery and accessibility Although liquidity and transparency are additional benefits the increasing use of ETPs is as much a reflection of the growing influence of passive investing more broadly across the asset management industry Investors are now questioning whether active managers are able to consistently outperform their benchmarks and are invariably turning to passive instruments like ETPs to provide consistent risk adjusted market returns Value for money The Pensions Regulator published its new draft DC code on th November In this report it emphasises the importance of assessing whether schemes offer value for money VFM Although there is not a prescribed definition of VFM costs and charges are highlighted as being an important consideration Fund management fees and portfolio transaction costs are referenced in particular On these two cost metrics ETPs are generally more cost efficient than actively managed funds The asset weighted expense ratio not including portfolio transaction costs for passive funds was only in compared with for active funds The above figures are particularly relevant when considering the charge controls on default arrangements in certain occupational pension schemes Lower cost passive solutions become more relevant when taking into consideration the p a cap that has recently been implemented Add lower portfolio transaction costs to this and the case for using passive instruments like ETPs to manage scheme costs begins to resonate with an increasing number of investment managers Cost however should not be considered in isolation In its guidance for DC pension schemes The Pensions Regulator states As investment returns net of charges have such a major impact on member outcomes trustees should pay particular attention in any VFM assessment to the investment return delivered to members In effect costs are a component of total investment returns therefore it is prudent for us to turn to the wider argument of how passive returns compare to actively managed funds and how ETPs can be implemented in schemes to improve risk adjusted returns Comparing active and passive investment returns The regulatory focus on costs and performance are not exclusive to DC schemes The government commissioned Hymans Robertson report looked at how the Local Government Pension Scheme LGPS could be reformed The report specifically questioned whether active managers are providing consistent above benchmark returns to justify their higher overall costs Indeed it was concluded that over an extended period of time active equity returns across various geographical regions failed to outperform the benchmark and that this trend was particularly prevalent in the case of developed market equities The conclusions in this report are consistent with the findings in a recent Morningstar study that compared active and passive returns across various US equity size and style categories The research found that over a ten year period aggregate passive funds outperformed active funds across eight of the nine defined categories In light of growing evidence of active manager underperformance the value proposition that they offer is being questioned by an increasing number of investment managers Trustees assessing whether schemes are offering VFM should be aware of the potential benefits of using passive instruments like ETPs either alongside or in place of certain active funds A smarter way forward With the future in mind one area of particular growth has been in smart beta products Their goal is to provide improved risk adjusted returns either increase returns and or reduce risk and enhanced diversification over the long term The strategies implemented are non market cap weighted and deliver exposure to systematic investment factors or alternative weighting schemes Investors can now access a variety of smart beta equity and fixed income exposures allowing one to gain exposure to a risk premium in a cheaper systematic way In the new era of VFM ETPs generally and specifically smart beta exposures provide an additional tool for managers to use in member pension schemes Rima Haddad is head of UK

D C Fort Pierce A The Florida tree law is based on the common law derived from court decisions It basically provides that the when a tree located on one parcel falls onto another parcel the owner of the parcel on which the tree fell is usually responsible for the tree removal and the cost thereof So in an HOA setting if a tree on the common area falls on to an individual lot the lot owner is responsible for the tree removal and cost not the HOA Likewise if a tree located on a lot fall onto the common area the HOA is responsible for its removal and cost The only things that changes this dynamic are The tree owner knew or should have known the tree was in imminent danger of falling and did nothing to stop it This would mean the tree owner or HOA was negligent and should pay for the cost of removal A perfectly healthy tree not in danger of falling under normal conditions that falls due to a hurricane does not make the tree owner negligent No one is expected to prevent a perfectly healthy tree from falling due to a hurricane The HOA governing documents make the HOA responsible for all trees on the common areas and the individual lots Q I live in a well run POA The Board and ACC exercise common sense relating to maintenance appearance document issues and the vast majority of residents comply However one resident is resisting a reasonable request to paint his house it is long overdue for paint The owner has stated the maximum fine he can be assessed is and that if he pays it the POA cannot revisit this issue Is this correct A E Vero Beach A No this is not correct Imposing a fine is an enforcement tool intended to compel the owner to stop violating the rules or take certain action such as painting their house Paying the fine does not relieve the owner from complying with the rule Think of it this way If local code enforcement sites a property owner and imposes a fine for a code violation and the owner pays the fine but does not correct the violation the county can still enforce compliance Q One of our owners died after obtaining a reverse mortgage on his condo The company who provided the second mortgage is not paying assessments nor is it maintaining the unit including not running the air conditioner What is our recourse A different owner who wants to obtain a reverse mortgage is requesting change in the language of our documents to conform with the lender s requirements We have not changed the language and now find the reverse mortgage was denied What is our association responsibility in these reverse mortgage situations A In the first instance whoever the current owner of the property is owes assessments at least from the day they took title forward This applies to a mortgage company bank that may now own the property So you should follow your normal collection procedure in collecting the debt incurred since the title was conveyed to the present owner As for the past due assessments that may have been due when the property was conveyed to the current owner it depends on several factors Who is the current owner the bank that held the reverse mortgage or some other party What do your governing documents provide If there is a second mortgage that entity has no obligation to pay the assessments or maintain the property until such time as the title is conveyed to the second mortgage holder Regarding the air conditioning the Association if the property is deemed abandoned under the Condominium Act the Association may step in and maintain the property and charge the cost to the current owner and even lien for the costs incurred Before doing this you should consult with your association s legal counsel as there are a lot of factors to be considered Regarding your second question your Board has no obligation to seek an amendment to the current governing documents to accommodate an owner seeking a reverse mortgage However if the owners sufficiently petition the Board to call a special members meeting to approve an amendment there is a mechanism under the Condominium Act that this could occur despite the support of the Board Richard D DeBoest II Esq is co founder and shareholder of the Law firm Goede Adamczyk DeBoest Cross PLLC Visit our website www gadclaw com or to ask questions about your issues for future columns send your inquiry to question gadclaw com The information provided herein is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as legal advice The publication of this article does not create an attorney client relationship between the reader and Goede Adamczyk DeBoest Cross PLLC or any of our attorneys Readers should not act or refrain from acting based upon the information contained in this article without first contacting an attorney Richard D DeBoest II Guest Columnist",0

The cashier would hand you $121.50 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ nearly $18 more than you would get back for the same transaction today. On that same day if you had instead spent your on a mysterious virtual currency named Bitcoin you d now be sitting on a pile of money worth Since those early days the online money has multiplied in value by hundreds and thousands But it has also taken a dive too Now if you were to make the same investment you wouldn t get as much back would only buy you of a Bitcoin Some financial experts reckon the value could rise further in the next few years Even top industry names including Elon Musk have shown their support as he revealed Tesla would look at allowing the currency for transactions once sourcing it becomes cleaner and greener But some investors grow more uncertain about the future of the leading currency as the value has recently tumbled and entered worrying lows So just how do you invest in the shadowy world of Bitcoin We explain everything you need to know but first a word of warning Investing in Bitcoin is risky as the value of the cryptocurrency can go down as well as up You should only invest if you understand the dangers and have the money to lose if something does go wrong The cryptocurrency was making a huge leap in value until it had a wobble at the beginning of this year and plummeted in May This just goes to show how it can just as easily go down and lose its value What is Bitcoin Bitcoin became the world s first entirely virtual currency when it was introduced in January Users cannot carry coins or notes and its value appears only as a number on a screen It was created by an online account which went by the name Satoshi Nakamoto At the moment one Bitcoin equals or to us When and why was Bitcoin created The cryptocurrency was introduced after the Great Financial Crisis of It was made in response to the world s reliance on banks for all financial transactions Bitcoin s founder planned to create a peer to peer payment system that did not rely on third party confirmation This means banks couldn t get involved in any money exchanges How does Bitcoin work data react Each Bitcoin is a computer file stored in a virtual space like a computer or even more recently a digital wallet app on a smartphone a bit like ApplePay data react You can send Bitcoins to others and they can send Bitcoins to you and you can store them in these spaces data react Transactions are recorded in a public list called the blockchain which makes them possible to trace data react That means people won t be able to spend coins they do not own make copies or undo transactions without it flagging on the history channel What is Bitcoin mining New currency is created via a complex online process called mining which uses supercomputers to create new Bitcoins using computer code data react The sums are becoming more and more difficult to stop too many Bitcoins being generated at any one time that s why the value is so high too data react If you started mining now it could take years to get a single Bitcoin it costs a lot in electricity bills too so you could end up spending more on your tariff than the currency is worth Why is Bitcoin popular Lots of people like the idea that it is a way of exchanging currency without the need for a bank It s also efficient to use over the internet There s a transparent set of rules too which means less control from outside parties over your money This can present its own dangers as well though Is Bitcoin safe data react Each Bitcoin transaction is recorded publicly so it s hard to copy the currency illegitimately make fake ones or spend ones you don t own data react But it is quite possible to lose your online wallet or delete it by accident and not be able to recover your investments data react There have also been thefts from some websites that let you store your Bitcoins too data react If you use Bitcoin for payments you should also know the price is extremely volatile data react The value could drop significantly at any moment and you could lose a lot of money data react It s also not regulated so you don t have the same protection as other services where you might be able to take a complaint to an ombudsman How can you buy Bitcoin The most common way to buy the currency is to download a broker app such as Coinbase and Blockchain These allow users to use a credit or debit cards to exchange pounds for Bitcoin Users do not have to buy whole Bitcoins and can purchase a small percentage that matches the value of their cash investment Once a request has been made online miners will decide whether to approve the transaction If approved the money will be taken from a user s account in exchange for Bitcoin When selling users can use the same app to sell their Bitcoin in return for its cash value What can you buy with Bitcoin In its early days Bitcoin proved relatively worthless with one notorious example seeing an early pioneer paying for a pizza using two bitcoins At Bitcoin s peak however that pizza would be worth the equivalent of around There are Bitcoin restaurants you can still use the money at if that s how you wish to spend the cryptocurrency But you can also use it to buy something as big as a car or as small as a video game Elon Musk pulled the means of using the currency to buy a Tesla as the company explained how mining it was so poor for the environment You will be able to buy one of the cars with the crypto cash though once of mining is done with clean energy How can you spend Bitcoin You can only spend Bitcoin virtually and in online transactions currently It s not the same as cash and you can t use odd change from your built up bank to pay for your parking or buy lunch at your local cafe Certain websites and companies are offering use of the currency though like Microsoft But if you lose virtual access to your money you will lose all of your investment Brit James Howells famously threw out a computer containing Bitcoins on its hard drive the equivalent of a whopping today As at the time only the computer the currency was bought on could be used to redeem it the money was all but lost to Welshman Howells The broken Dell laptop is now believed to be buried below a mound of rubbish at a tip in Newport Wales The cryptocurrency market fluctuates all the time but you can check its progress with our guide But more recently the price of Dogecoin has seen a surge after Elon Musk backed moves to massively slash its transaction fees China is cracking down on crypto mining though which is resulting in the price of Bitcoin plunging We pay for your stories Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team Email us at

The short answer is no, not unless you have received permission from the homeowner Ã¢â‚¬â€ either directly or through their agent. In an age when everyone has a cellphone camera it can be tempting to take photos and videos when you are searching for a home This can be especially helpful if you have seen a number of properties and want to keep track of which features were present in which home As well if you find a property you really like you might want to share photos or videos with your family and friends to get a second or third opinion or perhaps capture areas you would like to renovate to share with a contractor No matter the scenario I encourage you to check with your agent They typically have access to many photos of listed homes and some may even have detailed video tours which have become increasingly common since the pandemic began If there is something you would like to capture as a photo or video ask your agent to first get the seller s permission The listing agent will let you know if you get the owners approval to take some shots and also if there are any restrictions you need to be aware of For example the homeowner may not want any photos or videos taken of their children s bedrooms or certain home contents and belongings A few additional things for you to consider When visiting a property for sale remember that it is someone else s home Use your discretion and be respectful of their home and privacy Avoid capturing personal or identifying information about the homeowners This includes things like framed family photos and certificates displayed on walls and tables Do not take photos or videos of contents within cupboards and drawers or of any personal belongings If you do get permission to take photos please remember that they are intended for your personal reference only and should not be shared on social media or any other public platforms If you re on the other side and you are selling a property I suggest you clearly communicate with your agent about any preferences or privacy concerns pertaining to buyers taking photos or videos This way the agent will be able to put your instructions in writing in any listings and marketing materials about the home as well as notify prospective buyers agents prior to open houses and scheduled visits You can also take proactive safety measures when preparing your home for showings I recommend placing valuables like cash and jewelry as well as any paperwork with private information like passports bills investment tax and health records in a safe or locked cabinet While an agent must be present during showings unless you give specific instructions that they are not required and prospective buyers are generally advised not to capture any personal information even if permitted to take photos you will minimize your risk by taking these steps If you have a question for Joe about the home buying or selling process please email information reco on ca Joe Richer is registrar of the Real Estate Council of Ontario RECO This column is for general information purposes only and is not meant as legal or professional advice on real estate transactions Follow RECO on Twitter RECOhelps",0

With Democrats worried about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and Republicans focused on reinvigorating their legislative and administrative agendas, national pension and retirement policy questions arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t at the forefront of Donald TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first-100-days agenda. But given recent regulatory moves in retirement, such as those involving fiduciary rules, TrumpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“pro-growthÃ¢â‚¬Â agenda, and the current shaky foundation for the future of U.S. retirement, both he and Congress are likely to focus on some of these issuesÃ¢â‚¬â€which matter to both CFOs and rank-and-file alikeÃ¢â‚¬â€in the days ahead. Fiduciary Regulations President elect Trump is leaning towards either watering down or eliminating the new fiduciary rule all together That would essentially reverse many if not all of the changes that employer plan sponsors and broker dealers and other retirement plan service providers have implemented or are planning to implement to comply with the fiduciary rules The new U S Department of Labor fiduciary rule which goes into effect in April expands the investment advice fiduciary definition under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of The new rule requires all investment advisers including brokerages to act as fiduciaries when making recommendations or giving advice on k plans or individual retirement accounts IRAs including in instances of a rollover or distribution Today brokers can market retirement plan services and provide investment information to plan sponsors and participants while charging a commission for their services rather than fully transparent fees In such arrangements brokers are not required to act in a fiduciary capacity a higher standard of care and independence that requires the adviser to act solely in the best interest of their client Instead they may meet the investment suitability rules which don t require that the product or service be in the best interests of the buyer investor but only that the investment recommendation is suitable Allowing brokers to provide advice without being a fiduciary as the Trump administration might do would promote an environment which may lead to higher cost plan services and potential conflicts of interest as brokers may choose to seek out the arrangements that pay them the most rather than do what s in the best interests of plan sponsors and participants The Effect of Low Interest Rates on Pension Plans Unfunded pension obligations have soared since the economic crisis triggered by interest rates that have remained at historic lows Pension plans are highly interest rate sensitive and would benefit greatly from even a moderate increase in interest rates With a pro growth low tax agenda and the potential end of Dodd Frank s regulatory limitations and a more hawkish Federal Reserve interest rates are likely to rise And that would result in broadly improved funded status for pensions The End of Dodd Frank President elect Trump has stated he intends to roll back or scrap the Dodd Frank regulations which he believes are placing a stranglehold on the ability of banks to lend and fuel economic growth Generating more growth would increase capital spending and create more jobs thus encouraging savings investment and consumer spending With more money to spend and invest employees should look to save more in their retirement plans especially in light of lessons learned from the crisis Corporations would also be looking for tax deductions and may elect to increase employer matching and profit sharing contributions Tax Reform Trump has indicated he intends to simplify the tax code and make the United States more globally competitive by having only three individual tax rate tiers reducing the top tax rate from to and reducing the corporate tax rate from to However he is also likely to reduce or eliminate many tax filer statuses and eliminate many individual and corporate tax deductions Many preferential tax items will be on the table including the pretax deduction for k contributions Congress has been considering eliminating or reducing the amounts employees can contribute to plans on a pretax basis to create a new source of revenue for the federal government While that may seem preposterous since pretax k contributions are only tax deferred until retirement Congress generally sees the deduction as too costly to the government If changed this would leave most k plans with either lower savings limits or primarily limited to Roth k contributions Those are contributed to k plans on an after tax basis although funds can be withdrawn at retirement on a tax free basis This trade off of pre tax deductions for Roth plans would provide more revenue to the federal government today But it would deprive it of revenue over the long term as retirees begin to withdraw their funds or even years from now Removing the tax deduction which is quite popular with employees and employers or reducing the contribution limits would only increase the risk that large swaths of the U S population will be unprepared for retirement when it comes Social Security Reform On Social Security Trump has been vague But he has indicated it is his intent to improve solvency without cutting benefits There are very few variables in this equation To improve Social Security solvency policymakers can either reduce monthly benefits increase contributions by increasing the FICA FUTA withholding requirement increase the age at which benefits can be claimed or a combination of those approaches In the past Republicans have proposed creating personal accounts to allow employees to save and invest some of the money they defer into the Social Security program But if these savings dollars came from the existing FICA FUTA withholding amount it would likely reduce funding of the plan for existing retirees and those workers retiring in the near future thus accelerating the solvency crisis So while personal accounts may actually have a positive long term impact on Generation Y and Z workers entering the workforce the existing trust would still be at risk if no other changes are made Another consideration is the impact of increasing FICA FUTA withholding on the economy If employees and employers are forced to contribute more to the Social Security program it would take money out of the economy and result in significant economic drag a fact which would not be lost on Trump as he tries to jump start U S growth There is however a reason that politicians have been unable or unwilling to change the system all of the policy prescriptions available are highly unpopular Small Business Open Multiple Employer Plans Congress is considering a bill to make it possible for small unrelated employers to join together in groups to offer a single retirement plan for their employees instead of offering individual plans Aggregating these employees into large groups which would effectively amount to group purchasing of k retirement services would provide improved economies of scale and lower pricing for employers and costs to employees That would also make ERISA compliance easier while increasing the ability of small employers to offer more robust and valuable retirement benefits Given that small businesses are the largest net employer in the United States this could be an important assist to our ability to save for retirement The problem the bill would solve is that these MEP arrangements aren t permitted under current law for unrelated employers Today employers either need to be related via common ownership cooperative service organizations or trade associations and meet certain other criteria in order to be considered eligible to participate in a MEP This squeezes out the average small employer and makes plan expenses higher and less attractive for both plan sponsors and participants alike Open MEPs are popular on both sides of the political aisle and a bill is likely to pass Congress in or with the signature by President Trump a high likelihood While the above isn t an exhaustive list it s a good starting point on the essentials of retirement post election In the days ahead expect more change and analysis as the implications of the election continue to unfold Rob Massa a wealth adviser is director of retirement at Ascende an EPIC Company in Atlanta",0

Stephen Poloz's public debut was as much about what he didn't say - or wasn't asked - than what opinions he actually offered up.

Instead, the new governor of the Bank of Canada on Thursday leaned heavily on the ""confidence"" factor of the 79-year-old institution to carry the country through the recovery and beyond. The common denominator that ties together all of the bank s work is confidence Mr Poloz told the House of Commons finance committee Through our actions and our words what the Bank of Canada delivers is first confidence in our currency second confidence in our role as fiscal agent for the federal government thirdly confidence in our banking system and finally confidence in the value of money Mr Poloz began his seven year term at the helm of the Bank of Canada on Monday taking over from Mark Carney who is moving to London to become the Bank of England governor in July Right off the top Mr Poloz noted Thursday was only day four on the job for me I trust you will forgive me if there are any details I haven t yet become familiar with Even so the year old Mr Poloz plucked from Export Development Canada where he worked since most recently as its president and CEO was peppered with questions mostly soft for two hours and attempted to answer most of them On the bank s key interest rate which has been at a near record low since September he stuck mostly to Mr Carney s script telling the committee that borrowing costs are going to rise to a normal level at some point He cautioned households to be ready for that as the bank has repeated in recent years as consumer debt soared Mr Poloz praised the bank s inflation targeting policy first put in place in and now focused on attaining a level Meanwhile he said corporate Canada needs to boost investment to expand capacity but he backed away from Mr Carney s criticism of firms who sit on dead money Mr Poloz said one of the most important ingredients to getting the investment momentum we expect to see is having a healthy balance sheet and being ready However he would not be drawn into a debate over the strength of the Canadian dollar and its impact on export growth an issue close to those at EDC and export driven industries Much has been made of Mr Poloz s previous year run with the Bank of Canada but that was many years ago and he has spent much of the time after that in the belly of the export beast It would naturally be difficult to interpret exactly where he will stand on the major issues once he starts drinking the central bank s water again His first interest rate decision is not until July and as such he did not stray far Thursday from recent bank statements the last one coming only last week As I expected there were no surprises just reassuring words said Louis Gagnon professor of finance at Queen s university in kingston Ont In this business no news is often the best news that you can expect Mr Gagnon said the bank will continue asserting its independence from the central government which is critical to preserve its credibility and it will remain committed to its inflation targeting policy framework under Mr Poloz In other words a status quo Christopher Ragan associate professor of economics at McGill university in Montreal said the interesting time will be after his first rate setting By then he ll do the press release the press conference that goes along with the rate decision and that s when he will actually have carved out a position on some of these things he said I think at this point it s hard to tell the difference between dovish and it s so early in the game that he s really not prepared to say really anything in one direction or the other Mr Ragan who also holds the David dodge chair in monetary policy at the C d Howe Institute in Toronto added I don t think of Steve as a dove However Avery Shenfeld chief economist at CIBC World Markets said it is hard to place him in the aviary of central bankers after only a few days on the job The real test won t come until the economy has improved or softened enough to make an interest rate change a viable option In his prepared statement to the committee Mr Poloz acknowledged that the global economy continues to struggle Global economic activity is expected to grow modestly this year before strengthening over the following two years he said But this is not a recovery in the usual sense It s more like a post war reconstruction It will require sustained and focused efforts to rebuild global economic potential gisfeld nationalpost com",0

After months of battling in court, key players fighting over World Class properties convened on the back steps of the Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse for a series of cash auctions. Nate Paul was bidding as was Will Hardeman who along with his father has been accused by Paul of perpetuating a fraudulent scheme to wrest control of World Class properties through foreclosure with the aid of a federal judge and a court appointed receiver The group which also includes real estate professional Justin Bayne has scooped up a handful World Class bank notes over the past months prompting contentious legal disputes in the process Austin Business Journal has found no evidence that the Hardeman group has broken the law Bryan Hardeman Will s father was also in attendance though he preferred to talk about the future of the Dog s Head area of East Austin rather than his own plans Mark Riley attached to the Hardeman Group as trustee for several of the contested properties was flanked by private security as he conducted a pair of auctions Multiple observers suggested the scene was unlike anything they had ever scene at a foreclosure sale World Class is a major owner of Austin real estate rising to local and national prominence in recent years as Paul employed a buy and hold strategy But it has been hobbled since federal authorities raided its offices in August World Class has filed more than bankruptcy cases in federal court in Austin including three new cases filed May to head off other foreclosures After a chaotic day at the courthouse there were as many questions as answers But here s what we know Three foreclosure sales were conducted for World Class owned properties for the former M campus owned by Silicon Hills Campus LLC a shopping center at Burnet Rd owned by WC Teakwood Plaza LLC and vacant land along South Congress Ave in South Austin owned by WC South Congress LLC Two of the sales appeared to have been successfully completed though the threat of legal challenges hang over both However the auction for the old M campus failed because the winner failed to produce payment Learn more about the sales below World Class filed three bankruptcies to avoid foreclosure They were for WC th and Waller LLC which owns an East Austin building at Waller St WC th and Rio Grande which owns the Rio night club at Rio Grande St and WC Culebra Crossing SA LP which owns property in San Antonio The bankruptcies were all filed by Mark Ralston of Fishman Jackson Ronquillio PLLC who declined comment World Class avoided foreclosure on WC W Ben White LP which owns property off Ben White Boulevard near Menchaca Road in South Austin by obtaining financing to pay off its debt to BBVA USA The property has an assessed value of more than million Paul in emails sent after this story was initially published railed against the auctions and claimed his attempts to pay off World Class debts have been ignored More on a wild day at the courthouse By p m May tempers were flaring at the Travis County courthouse Paul shouted expletives at trustee Mark Riley and the two engaged in multiple heated exchanges throughout the afternoon including during an auction for WC South Congress LLC As Paul protested the bids slowly ticked upward million million million Riley had allowed one auction participant to bid with reserve funds but said that if the funds don t qualify by p m then we re going to start over The winning bid was for The man who submitted it declined to identify himself other than saying he was a Houston businessman He said the South Congress property could be a site for future multifamily development It was unclear if the p m deadline was met but the sale did not restart World Class had attempted to resolve its debts in the bankruptcy case of WC South Congress LLC before that auction but a judge denied the motion because it did not propose paying post petition interest and costs to the secured lender the Hardeman group s Soco LP World Class said in bankruptcy filings it had secured million in new financing from an entity called South Congress Lender LLC According to the Texas Comptroller s office the LLC was registered April by Jules Caplin who declined to comment Controversy also swirled around the acre former M campus owned by World Class Silicon Hills Campus LLC which has been tied up in litigation since World Class defaulted on a million loan for the property in August That was the same month M moved out to new digs in Northeast Austin and the property has been vacant ever since With roughly million square feet of space the campus is among the largest and most prominent properties owned by World Class The firm has been fighting foreclosure for about months On May Travis Funding LLC submitted a winning bid of million for the campus and the auction concluded at p m But the buyer failed to materialize with the funds by a p m deadline Angela Zavala substitute trustee for the property attempted another auction but did not complete it by a p m deadline The sale has been voided The original people did not get here at p m with their checks Zavala said at the courthouse according to a video provided to Austin Business Journal by an associate of Paul The auction did go past p m which we cannot do Travis Funding LLC had been in a bidding war with Silicon Hills Campus lender ATX Debt Fund which topped out with a credit and cash bid of million In the bankruptcy case of Silicon Hills Campus World Class similarly attempted but lost an attempt to stop the auction in court World Class claimed in court filings that it had obtained million in debtor in possession financing from Travis Funding LLC That would have been enough to pay off ATX Debt Fund s entire claim estimated to be in excess of million We offered to pay it in full Paul said May at the courthouse adding that he put up a total of million in bankruptcy court in the days before the foreclosure sales with the hope of clearing all of his debts Travis Funding LLC was incorporated in Delaware on May according to public records In a May letter submitted in bankruptcy court the entity agreed to place the million in escrow to accrue at a fixed rate of Attorney James Billingsley who represented ATX Debt Fund at the sale said if the winning million bid went through it would have resulted in his clients being paid in full and we ll have no further involvement Asked if there would be relief in that outcome after being tied up in the case since the fall of Billingsley quipped If I make my flight back to Dallas there will be In the end it appears the fight over Silicon Hills Campus will continue If a resolution is not reached before next month s slate of foreclosure sales either by resolving the debt or through legal action the campus will likely be back on the auction block June The original lender for Silicon Hills Campus LLC was Ladder Capital Finance LLC Then in January ATX Debt Fund bought the million note according to Travis County records It is not clear who is behind ATX Debt Fund Another foreclosure sale was held May for WC Teakwood Plaza which owns property at Burnet Road in North Austin Though the sale was scheduled to be conducted between a m and p m it didn t conclude until after p m drawing the ire of Paul However Riley contended that the sale was permissible because he had announced it at a m It s unclear what might become of that dispute The auction initially appeared to be won by Monte James with a bid of million But James said after the auction there was a higher opening credit bid by the lender of million The Hardeman group s Burnet LP is the lender for WC Teakwood Plaza In a May email Paul suggested Riley ignored his million bid for the property during the auction though video provided by Paul was inconclusive as to whether the bid came in on time Paul also claimed that both Riley and Bryan Hardeman refused to accept full payment including post petition interest and legal fees for World Class debts on both WC Teakwood Plaza LLC and WC South Congress LLC ahead of the auctions I asked Mark Riley what is the total amount due before the auction and it was a higher number than we ve ever seen because they probably added other fees and expenses and in spite of that I tendered the payment in full Paul said in the email They refused to accept and proceeded to do the auction The WC Teakwood Plaza property is tied to a million loan from April and the notice of foreclosure was filed April That was the same day a federal bankruptcy judge granted a motion for relief from stay which effectively allowed Burnet LP to sell the property In addition to the foreclosures here are some additional details about the Chapter

District records Waller Lender in September earned a million judgment against World Class and Nate Paul over a defaulted bank note it purchased from a World Class lender in February The LLC traces back to a San Francisco based real estate investment group called Spear Street Capital according to information obtained from the Texas Secretary of State s office Spear Street Capital has been buying and selling large commercial properties in Austin for years According to the firm s website it was formed in and has since invested in more than properties throughout the world with a combined value

may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be Year Years Years Years Class P Shares Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund Portfolio Turnover The Fund pays transaction costs when it buys and sells securities or instruments i e turns over its portfolio A high rate of portfolio turnover may result in increased transaction costs including brokerage commissions which must be borne by the Fund and its shareholders and is also likely to result in higher short term capital gains for taxable shareholders These costs are not reflected in the annual fund operating expenses or in the expense example above but are reflected in the Fund s performance The Fund s portfolio turnover rate for the fiscal year ended October was of the average value of its portfolio Principal Investment Strategies The Fund generally seeks to achieve its investment objective by allocating its assets among multiple investment managers Underlying Managers who are unaffiliated with the Investment Adviser and who employ one or more non traditional and alternative investment strategies including but not limited to Equity Long Short Dynamic Equity Event Driven and Credit Relative Value Tactical Trading and Opportunistic Fixed Income Strategies each of which is described below The Fund will primarily invest in a portfolio of i equity securities including common and preferred stocks convertible securities rights and warrants depositary receipts real estate investment trusts REITs pooled investment vehicles including other investment companies exchange traded funds ETFs European registered investment funds UCITS and private investment funds and partnership interests including master limited partnerships MLPs ii fixed income and or floating rate securities including debt issued by corporations debt issued by governments including the U S and foreign governments their agencies instrumentalities sponsored entities and political subdivisions covered bonds notes debentures debt participations convertible bonds non investment grade securities commonly known as junk bonds bank loans including senior secured loans and other direct indebtedness iii mortgage backed and other mortgage related securities asset backed securities municipal securities to be announced TBA securities and custodial receipts iv currencies and v unregistered securities including for example restricted securities eligible for resale pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of as amended Securities Act The Fund s investments may be publicly traded or privately issued or negotiated The Fund may invest without restriction as to issuer capitalization country currency maturity or credit rating The Fund s investments may include securities of U S and foreign issuers including securities of issuers in emerging countries and securities denominated in a currency other than the U S dollar Up to of the Fund s net assets may be invested in illiquid investments The Fund does not have a target duration The Fund may invest in stock warrants and other securities of special purpose acquisition companies SPACs including for purposes of effectuating the Event Driven and Relative Value strategies that are described below A SPAC is typically a publicly traded company that raises funds through an initial public offering IPO for the purpose of acquiring or merging with another company to be identified subsequent to the SPAC s IPO The Fund will also invest in derivatives for both hedging and non hedging purposes although no Underlying Manager is required to hedge any of the Fund s positions or to use derivatives The Fund s derivative investments may include i futures contracts including futures based on equity or fixed income securities and or equity or fixed income indices interest rate futures currency futures and swap futures ii swaps including equity currency interest rate total return variance and credit default swaps and swaps on futures contracts iii options including long and short positions in call options and put options on indices individual securities or currencies swaptions and options on futures contracts iv forward contracts including forwards based on equity or fixed income securities and or equity or fixed income indices currency forwards interest rate forwards swap forwards and non deliverable forwards and v other instruments including structured securities exchange traded notes and contracts for differences CFDs As a result of the Fund s use of derivatives the Fund may also hold significant amounts of U S Treasuries or short term investments including money market funds repurchase agreements cash and time deposits The Fund may use leverage e g through borrowing and or the use of derivatives As a result the sum of the Fund s investment exposures may significantly exceed the amount of assets invested in the Fund although these exposures may vary over time The Fund may take long and or short positions in a wide range of asset classes including equities fixed income commodities and currencies among others Long positions benefit from an increase in the price of the underlying instrument or asset class while short positions benefit from a decrease in that price The Fund may implement short positions through short sales of any instrument including ETFs that the Fund may purchase for investment or by using options swaps futures forwards and other derivatives For example the Fund may enter into a futures contract pursuant to which it agrees to sell an asset that it does not currently own at a specified price and time in the future This gives the Fund a short position with respect to that asset The Fund intends to gain exposure to the commodities markets primarily by investing in five wholly owned subsidiaries of the Fund each organized as a company under the laws of the Cayman Islands together the MMA Subsidiaries The MMA Subsidiaries are advised by the Investment Adviser and subadvised by one or more Underlying Managers The Fund may also gain exposure to the commodities markets through investments in other investment companies ETFs or other pooled investment vehicles The Fund may invest up to of its total assets in aggregate in the MMA Subsidiaries The MMA Subsidiaries primarily obtain their commodity exposure by investing in commodity linked derivative instruments including but not limited to commodity futures commodity options and commodity linked swaps Commodity futures contracts are standardized exchange traded contracts that provide for the sale or purchase of or economic exposure to the price of a commodity or a specified basket of commodities at a future time An option on commodities gives the purchaser the right and the writer of the option the obligation to assume a position in a commodity or a specified basket of commodities at a specified exercise price within a specified period of time Commodity linked swaps are derivative instruments whereby the cash flows agreed upon between counterparties are dependent upon the price of the underlying commodity or commodity index over the life of the swap The value of commodity linked derivatives will rise and fall in response to changes in the underlying commodity or commodity index Commodity linked derivatives expose the MMA Subsidiaries and the Fund economically to movements in commodity prices Such instruments may be leveraged so that small changes in the underlying commodity prices would result in disproportionate changes in the value of the swaps Neither the Fund nor the MMA Subsidiaries invest directly in physical commodities The Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund MMA Subsidiaries also invest in other instruments including fixed income securities either as investments or to serve as margin or collateral for its swap positions and foreign currency transactions including forward contracts From time to time the Investment Adviser may for short or longer term periods select a transition manager to transition a portion of Fund assets from one Underlying Manager to another or at the direction of the Investment Adviser to implement a sub strategy with an objective of providing investment results that seek to correspond before fees and expenses to the performance of a specified index The Investment Adviser or an Underlying Manager on behalf of the Fund may obtain passive exposure to a particular sub asset class from time to time by making an index based investment e g in an ETF Management Process The Investment Adviser and the Fund have received an exemptive order from the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC Under the exemptive order the Investment Adviser has the ultimate responsibility subject to oversight by the Fund s Board of Trustees to oversee the Underlying Managers and recommend their hiring termination and replacement The initial shareholder of the Fund approved the Fund s operation in this manner and reliance by the Fund on this exemptive order The Investment Adviser determines the percentage of the Fund s portfolio allocated to each Underlying Manager in order to seek to achieve the Fund s investment objective The Investment Adviser s Alternative Investments Manager Selection AIMS Group is responsible for making recommendations with respect to hiring terminating or replacing the Fund s Underlying Managers as well as the Fund s asset allocations With respect to the Fund the AIMS Group applies a multifaceted process with respect to manager due diligence portfolio construction and risk management The Investment Adviser may determine to allocate the Fund s assets to Underlying Managers employing all or a subset of the nontraditional and alternative strategies described below at any one time and may change those allocations from time to time in its sole discretion and without prior notice to shareholders In the future the Investment Adviser may also determine to allocate the Fund s assets to Underlying Managers employing other strategies not described herein The descriptions of the investment strategies below are subjective are not complete descriptions of any strategy and may differ from classifications made by other investment advisers that implement similar investment strategies The Investment Adviser s determination of the strategy shall govern Equity Long Short Strategies generally involve long and short investing based on fundamental evaluations research and various analytical measurements in equity and equity related investments Equity Long Short managers may for example buy stocks that they expect to outperform or that they believe to be undervalued and may also sell short stocks that they believe will underperform or that they believe to be overvalued Within this framework Equity Long Short managers may exhibit a range of styles including longer term buy and hold investing and or shorter term trading styles The portion of the Fund s assets invested in equity long short strategies may cumulatively represent a net short or net long position though are typically net long Dynamic Equity Strategies generally involve investing in equity instruments often with a long term view Dynamic Equity Strategies are long biased strategies and may have low excess return correlations to traditional long only equity strategies Dynamic Equity Strategies are less likely to track a benchmark than traditional long only strategies Dynamic Equity managers are less constrained than traditional long only managers with respect to factors such as position concentration sector and country weights style and market capitalization Dynamic Equity managers may hedge long positions and may also purchase in addition to equity investments bonds options preferred securities and convertible securities among others Event Driven and Credit Strategies seek to achieve gains from market movements in security prices caused by specific corporate events or changes in perceived relative value These strategies may include among others Merger Arbitrage Distressed Credit Opportunistic Credit and Value With a Catalyst investing styles Merger Arbitrage investing involves long and or short investments in securities affected by a corporate merger or acquisition Distressed Credit investing typically involves the purchase of securities or other financial instruments usually bonds or bank loans of companies that are in or are about to enter bankruptcy or financial distress Opportunistic Credit investing generally involves investing across the capital structure which could include investing in both mezzanine debt and convertible securities of an issuer and or adjusting exposures across fixed income and floating rate market segments based on perceived opportunity and current market conditions This can be done by taking a long position in a credit security or other financial instrument that is believed to be underpriced or a short position in a credit security or other financial instrument that is believed to be overpriced Value With a Catalyst investing involves taking a view on the likelihood and potential stock price outcome of corporate events such as divestitures spin offs material litigation changes in management or large share buybacks Relative Value Strategies seek to identify and benefit from price discrepancies between related assets assets that share a common financial factor such as interest rates an issuer or an index Relative Value opportunities generally rely on arbitrage the simultaneous purchase and sale of related assets that may exist between two issuers or within the capital structure of a single issuer Relative Value Strategies attempt to exploit a source of return with low correlation to the market Relative Value Strategies include among others fixed income arbitrage convertible arbitrage volatility arbitrage statistical arbitrage and equity market neutral strategies Tactical Trading Strategies seek to produce total return by long and short investing across global fixed income currency equity and commodity markets Tactical Trading managers may employ various investment styles of which the two major strategies are global macro and managed futures Tactical Trading managers that employ a global macro style may select their investments based upon fundamental and or technical analysis Tactical Trading managers that employ a managed futures style may use quantitative modeling techniques for example determining an asset s value based upon an analysis of price history price momentum and the asset s value relative to that of other assets among other factors Tactical Trading managers typically have no structural bias to be long short or neutral but at any given time may have significant long or short exposures in a particular market or asset class Along with other markets Tactical Trading Managers may invest in commodity related instruments including but not limited to commodity futures and commodity exchange traded funds Commodity markets are influenced by among other things changing supply and demand relationships weather governmental agricultural commercial and trade programs and policies designed to influence commodity prices world political and economic events and changes in interest rates Opportunistic Fixed Income Strategies seek to deliver positive absolute returns in excess of cash investments regardless of economic cycle i e downturns and upswings or cyclical credit availability Opportunistic Fixed Income managers seek to maintain diversified exposure across various fixed income and floating rate market Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund segments with a focus on more liquid markets assessing the relative value across sectors and adjusting portfolio weightings based on opportunity Opportunistic Fixed Income managers generally employ a bottom up credit analysis approach and a value aspect in selecting investments utilizing long and short investments as well as some notional leverage Opportunistic Fixed Income managers may seek exposure to potential income generators including among others global emerging markets investment grade and high yield debt markets convertible bonds and bank loans Additional Information The Fund s primary benchmark index is the ICE BofAML Three Month U S Treasury Bill Index Principal Risks of the Fund Loss of money is a risk of investing in the Fund The investment program of the Fund is speculative entails substantial risks and includes alternative investment techniques not employed by traditional mutual funds The Fund should not be relied upon as a complete investment program The Fund s investment techniques if they do not perform as designed may increase the volatility of performance and the risk of investment loss including the loss of the entire amount that is invested and there can be no assurance that the investment objective of the Fund will be achieved Moreover certain investment techniques which the Fund may employ in its investment program can substantially increase the adverse impact to which the Fund s investments may be subject There is no assurance that the investment processes of the Fund will be successful that the techniques utilized therein will be implemented successfully or that they are adequate for their intended uses or that the discretionary element of the investment processes of the Fund will be exercised in a manner that is successful or that is not adverse to the Fund An investment in the Fund is not a bank deposit and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation FDIC or any government agency Investors should carefully consider these risks before investing The Fund s principal risks are presented below in alphabetical order and not in the order of importance or potential exposure Absence of Regulation Risk The Fund engages in over the counter OTC transactions which trade in a dealer network rather than on an exchange In general there is less governmental regulation and supervision of transactions in the OTC markets than of transactions entered into on organized exchanges Call Prepayment Risk An issuer could exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by the Fund such as a mortgage backed security earlier than expected This may happen when there is a decline in interest rates when credit spreads change or when an issuer s credit quality improves Under these circumstances the Fund may be unable to recoup all of its initial investment and will also suffer from having to reinvest in lower yielding securities Commodity Sector Risk Exposure to the commodities markets may subject the Fund to greater volatility than investments in more traditional securities The value of commodity linked investments may be affected by changes in overall market movements commodity index volatility changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity such as drought floods weather livestock disease embargoes tariffs and international economic political and regulatory developments The prices of energy industrial metals precious metals agriculture and livestock sector commodities may fluctuate widely due to factors such as changes in value supply and demand and governmental regulatory policies The commodity linked investments in which the MMA Subsidiaries may invest may involve counterparties in the financial services sector and events affecting the financial services sector may cause the MMA Subsidiaries and therefore the Fund s share value to fluctuate Counterparty Risk Many of the protections afforded to cleared transactions such as the security afforded by transacting through a clearing house might not be available in connection with OTC transactions Therefore in those instances in which the Fund enters into uncleared OTC transactions the Fund will be subject to the risk that its direct counterparty will not perform its obligations under the transactions and that the Fund will sustain losses Because the Fund s Underlying Managers may trade with counterparties prime brokers clearing brokers or futures commission merchants FCMs on terms that are different than those on which the Investment Adviser would trade and because each Underlying Manager applies its own risk analysis in evaluating potential counterparties for the Fund the Fund may be subject to greater counterparty risk than if it were managed directly by the Investment Adviser Credit Default Risk An issuer or guarantor of fixed income securities or instruments held by the Fund which may have low credit ratings may default on its obligation to pay interest and repay principal or default on any other obligation Additionally the credit quality of securities may deteriorate rapidly which may impair the Fund s liquidity and cause significant deterioration in net asset value NAV These risks are more pronounced in connection with the Fund s investments in non investment grade fixed income securities Derivatives Risk The Fund s use of options forwards futures swaps structured securities and other derivative instruments may result in losses These instruments which may pose risks in addition to and greater than those associated with investing directly in securities currencies or other instruments may be illiquid or less liquid volatile difficult to price and leveraged so that small changes in the value of the underlying instruments may produce disproportionate losses to the Fund Certain derivatives are also subject to counterparty risk which is the risk that the other party in the transaction will not fulfill its contractual obligations The use of derivatives is a highly specialized activity that involves investment techniques and risks different from those associated with investments in more traditional securities and instruments Expenses Risk By investing in pooled investment vehicles including private investment funds investment companies ETFs UCITS and money market funds partnerships and REITs indirectly through the Fund the investor will incur not only a proportionate share of the expenses of the other pooled investment vehicles partnerships and REITs held by the Fund including operating costs and investment management fees but also the expenses of the Fund The Fund s multi manager approach may also result in additional expenses Extension Risk An issuer could exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation held by the Fund such as a mortgage backed security later than expected This may happen when there is a rise in interest rates Under these circumstances the value of the obligation will decrease and the Fund will also suffer from the inability to reinvest in higher yielding securities Foreign and Emerging Countries Risk Foreign securities may be subject to risk of loss because of more or less foreign government regulation less public information less stringent investor protections less stringent accounting corporate governance financial reporting and disclosure standards and less economic political and social stability in the countries in which the Fund invests The imposition of sanctions exchange controls including repatriation restrictions confiscations Summary Prospectus Goldman Sachs Multi Manager Alternatives Fund trade restrictions including tariffs and other government restrictions by the United States and other governments or from problems in share registration settlement or custody may also result in losses The type and severity of sanctions and other similar measures including counter sanctions and other retaliatory actions that may be imposed could vary broadly in scope and their impact is impossible to predict For example the imposition of sanctions and other similar measures could among other things cause a decline in the value and or liquidity of securities issued by the sanctioned country or companies located in or economically tied to the sanctioned country and increase market volatility and disruption in the sanctioned country and throughout the world Sanctions and other similar measures could limit or prevent the Fund from buying and selling securities in the sanctioned country and other markets significantly delay or prevent the settlement of securities transactions and significantly impact the Fund s liquidity and performance Foreign risk also involves the risk of negative foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which may cause the value of securities denominated in such foreign currency or other instruments through which the Fund has exposure to foreign currencies to decline in value Currency exchange rates may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time These risks may be more pronounced in connection with the Fund s investments in securities of issuers located in or otherwise economically tied to emerging countries Geographic Risk If the Fund focuses its investments in issuers located in a particular country or geographic region it will subject the Fund to a greater extent than if investments were less focused to the risks of volatile economic cycles and or conditions and developments that may be particular to that country or region such as adverse securities markets adverse exchange rates adverse social political regulatory economic business environmental or other developments or natural disasters High Portfolio Turnover Risk Some or all of the strategies utilized by the Fund may involve frequent and active trading and have a high portfolio turnover rate which may increase the Fund s transaction costs may adversely affect the Fund s performance and or may generate a greater amount of short term capital gain distributions to shareholders than if the Fund had a low portfolio turnover rate Active trading in derivatives will have the same effects but will not always be reflected in the Fund s portfolio turnover rate Index Risk To the extent that an index tracking strategy is used with respect to a portion of the Fund s assets including through investment in an ETF that seeks to track an index or implementation of a sub strategy by a transition manager the Fund will be negatively affected by general declines in the securities and asset classes represented in the relevant index There is no guarantee that the Fund or relevant portion of the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the relevant index Market disruptions and regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on the Fund s ability or the ability of an ETF in which it invests to adjust its exposure to the required levels in order for the relevant portion of the Fund to track the relevant index In addition because that portion of the Fund is not actively managed unless a specific security is removed from the relevant index the Fund or an ETF in which it invests generally would not sell a security because the security s issuer was in financial trouble At times when an index tracking strategy is used with respect to a portion of the Fund s assets the Fund s performance could be lower than funds that may actively shift all of their portfolio assets to take advantage of market opportunities or to lessen the impact of a market decline or a decline in the value of one or more issuers Interest Rate Risk When interest rates increase fixed income securiti,0
"Mergers and acquisitions among health care organizations continue to affect not-for-profit health care organizations and their retirement plan investing decisions.

Consulting firm Mercer has released a list of ten investment priorities for not-for-profit health care organizations.","Mergers and acquisitions among health care organizations continue to affect not-for-profit health care organizations and their retirement plan investing decisions.

Consulting firm Mercer has released a list of ten investment priorities for not-for-profit health care organizations. Many not for profit health systems are currently engaged in or considering strategic actions such as a merger acquisition operating agreement or joint venture notes Michael Ancell senior consultant and national segment leader for health care investments at Mercer in St Louis Missouri He explains to PLANADVISER that during such actions organizations prioritize projects and the number one priority is patient care and getting operations configured Because of this organizations often put off decisions about consolidation of retirement plans However strategic actions among not for profit health care organizations have been going on for years and many are now facing retirement plan issues Ancell says An organization may end up with multiple defined contribution plans and needs to consolidate and bring best practices into plan governance design and investment lineup According to Ancell Mercer is seeing more requests for proposals RFPs as health systems turn to this project and need help He adds that part of due diligence before completing mergers and acquisitions is to understand defined benefit plan assumptions used by each entity to calculate future benefit payments One issue unique to not for profit health care organizations is that some may be classified as church plans not subject to Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA or Pension Protection Act PPA requirements These plans have more flexibility in the assumptions they can use for benefit calculations as well as funding schedules Some health care organizations want to maintain that status and the flexibility it provides for those plans so consolidating defined benefit plans can be tricky In general Mercer says some strategic actions may materially alter an organization s balance sheet and boards may be unwilling to tolerate a significant asset decline post action Finance and investment committees should consider how best to integrate investment strategy and whether these factors may necessitate a change in investment risk profile Managing endowment assets is important because those assets can be used to fund pension benefits Ancell notes If organizations have a defined benefit plan they fund it with operations revenue but if they don t make enough they will have to pull money out of endowments The combination of organizations and their corresponding committees warrants revisiting key investment policy questions such as time horizon risk tolerance and return objectives for the new combined entity Mercer has prepared a survey designed to facilitate this process For those organizations looking to de risk defined benefit plans Mercer suggests developing a strategy for getting the plan fully funded Ancell points out that interest rates keep dropping and if an organization has developed an end game and puts the plan on a de risking glide path lower interest rates will make funded status worse Another issue unique to not for profit health care entities is the organizational and cost related changes brought on by Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA requirements Some organizations are not as financially healthy as before Ancell says and they may need to look again at the endowment and pension plan risks they can take But Mercer says that in some not for profit health care organizations have seen modest improvement in volumes and operating conditions Improved operations may have increased their risk tolerance For defined contribution plans organizations that have gone through a merger or acquisition should be aware of the differences between plans and will eventually will need to harmonize the plans so certain employees are not getting a better or worse benefit than others Ancell says He adds that retirement plan consolidation should not be taken lightly or quickly Organizations should take this opportunity to review plan design and the long term vision for their plans how they are incentivizing employees to participate in the plans and how they helping plan participants achieve retirement readiness Tackle the entire project with a long term view of what you want the plan to be for your organization and the outcomes you want for participants he suggests According to Ancell Mercer recommends that not for profit health care organizations adopt a formal investment policy statement make a clear committee assignment for defined contribution plans and develop a charter for the committee members outlining their responsibilities Mercer suggests organizations clearly define defined contribution plan governance and consider whether this is an HR function or finance investment committee responsibility It notes that recent regulatory attention has focused on defined contribution plan fees and is likely to expand to other areas Boards may wish to reconsider which area of an organization is best equipped to ensure regulatory compliance and recognize that ultimate fiduciary duty resides within the organization not its plan recordkeeper Other investment steps for not for profit health care organizations recommended by Mercer include Set a risk floor for the system Most not for profit health systems are subject to debt covenants that may restrict the amount of investment risk they can take with their investment portfolios Institutions should quantify their risk floor and address it in the investment policy Assess the governance structure of investment portfolios and whether a delegated solution offers potential time and cost savings Transformation in the delivery of care coupled with existing operating pressures require health care organizations to reduce costs while increasing the quality of care Delegating certain elements of an organization s investment function can potentially reduce investment expenses and free up staff and committee time to focus on strategy Review the fixed income allocation and evaluate whether unconstrained bond funds could be a component of a fixed income program Health care operating portfolios have generally been structured more conservatively than traditional endowment portfolios with larger allocations to fixed income Operating revenue shortfalls may increase reliance on operating portfolio returns however historically low fixed income yields present a challenge In addition to ensuring that overall allocations are appropriate to support an operating portfolio s multiple objectives organizations should determine if the size and composition of fixed income holdings remain appropriate and understand their sensitivity to a rising rate environment The fixed income portfolio could even be viewed as a partial hedge to variable rate debt on the balance sheet Set an illiquidity budget as part of managing the overall risk profile Some systems are increasing their allocations to private or illiquid assets Yet rating agencies may count illiquid assets in days cash on hand calculations The investment committee should determine how illiquid investments are viewed by all constituencies and set an illiquidity budget as part of the overall risk profile",0

 A Chinese trade delegation in Washington last month demanded compensation for losses to China s steel industry caused by tariffs of on steel imports to the U S imposed March It said the tariffs violated World Trade Organization provisions The compensation demand marked the first time that China has pressed for WTO enforcement of free trade provisions since its entry to the trade body in December The U S steel tariffs have provoked similar protests from Japan South Korea and the European Union Aldonas said the tariffs were imposed after a transparent nine month investigation by the U S International Trade Commission that confirmed dumping of steel imports including those from China Aldonas made the comments at the conclusion of meetings with government officials including Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng regarding the implementation of China s World Trade Organization commitments The months since China s WTO entry have seen the imposition of a series of regulations that have been perceived as protectionist measures designed by China to circumvent WTO provisions that require a gradual opening of its markets Those regulations included an increase in the capitalization requirements for new foreign bank branches new regulatory rules for genetically modified agricultural imports and a ban on foreign investment in GMO research and development projects Aldonas said that he had conveyed to Chinese officials U S concerns about the need for transparency and predictability in the domestic business environment and the need for the central government to ensure that rules related to WTO compliance are implemented at the local level Specific issues discussed included the delay in China s release of import tariff rate quotas and problems encountered by U S insurance companies in expanding into the Chinese market Aldonas said However Aldonas described his discussions as very fruitful and said he was optimistic that China would fully comply with its WTO agreement At this point I think the commitment is there to get WTO provisions implemented there are some practical problems we need to work through but I really think those are things that are surmountable Aldonas said By Phelim Kyne Dow Jones Newswires Phelim kyne dowjones com",0

A few years ago I was house-hunting. I received details on one attractive property from a nearby estate agent and was somewhat startled to read that there was a large double radiator in the garden.    Intrigued we visited the property to explore the benefits of outdoor heating When we arrived we found no radiator in the garden but could not help but notice that the house did have possibly the largest conservatory I had ever seen in the UK attached to a house measuring about foot by foot There was no mention of this on the particulars The estate agent s details had failed to mention this spectacular mini Crystal Palace The bemused seller explained he had reported both errors to his estate agent when he put the property up for sale nine months previously but the agents were still sending out the wrong details despite repeated complaints Convinced this was a rare case we asked another agent to measure up our house for sale A spotty year old duly arrived and began pointing his brand new infra red measuring device gadget around the rooms I was not in the house at the time but my wife tells me it was like being on the set of Star Wars As he moved around the house he informed my wife of the measurements She insisted that some sounded a bit odd but he ploughed on until he got to our own conservatory and mis measured it by more than feet As it had just been built she showed him the builder s own plans listing the correct measurements but he insisted he was right and would not be convinced otherwise Needless to say when the draft details turned up nearly every measurement was wrong and the manager apologised profusely for his Saturday boy and came round to do the job again When recounting these tales I am reminded yet again why home information packs a glorified estate agent s particulars will not work and what a thoroughly daft idea they are I am still staggered the government is blundering on with them despite overwhelming evidence they will not work The main problem is that like the estate agent details I was sent no one will trust them and they will be almost worthless They may save a few lazy estate agents a trip to your home and add hundreds of pounds to the cost of selling your property but no buyer will believe them They will want to carry out their own thorough checks and surveys Caveat Emptor will always be the dominant factor in property buying and the government will learn the hard way that it is making a big mistake in insisting sellers produce a pack that will be little more than a fancy estate agents report There are many more problems with Hips We are still waiting for the full rules to be published even though they are just a couple of months away The training of assessors is in a mess and even estate agents doubt their value The shame is that mortgage lenders and trade bodies did not lobby harder to torpedo this foolish idea Perhaps because the cost will fall mostly on the seller and a new industry will be created many thought not to bother This is a big mistake because one thing Hips will do is cause problems in the property market by slowing down the sales process particularly in fast moving property markets such as London The process of compiling a Hip could take weeks Just as lenders are striving to speed up the mortgage offer process the government has put the brakes on the whole business It is enough to make you want to put a radiator in the garden just for the hell of it The bigger the loan the better The latest buzz in the mortgage market is per cent and over loan to value Alliance Leicester Birmingham Midshires Northern Rock and others are queuing up to offer loans of up to per cent LTV You may think I am opposed to this Strangely I am not These loans have been around for a long time years or more although they have been restricted in the past to selected members of high earning professions whose salaries were expected to climb steadily giving them the ability to afford it Their wider availability is not an issue the regulators should be concerned about except if and it is a big if they are sold to the wrong people such as debt addicts who will almost certainly default on them Interestingly these products are mostly being sold through intermediaries who are perhaps best placed to explain the benefits and the dangers In essence per cent is an arbitrary figure in any event and lending more than the value of a property has always been possible for borrowers Historically lenders have leant towards keeping LTVs down to reduce their risks something particularly important during times of house price recession when a property could be falling in value and a repossessed property may be worth less than the price it was bought at Now lenders see property prices as only moving upwards Whether this is correct only time will tell It is certainly a risky strategy but probably not a disastrous one In reality the real risk with LTVs over per cent falls on the lender If they cannot recover their debt they will face the problems not the borrowers who may walk away from a loan they cannot afford albeit to face the prospect of being chased for many years for the outstanding debt Most borrowers particularly first time buyers want to enhance and invest in their property and these super size loans will help them do this As long as they can afford the repayments the borrowing costs are likely to be far more reasonable with a per cent LTV mortgage than with a credit card or a personal loan In many ways high LTVs can benefit borrowers by keeping borrowing costs down Whatever their faults in comparison with other types of debt mortgages remain relatively cheap Holding on to hand me downs Will we one day see the days of a property owning population Mrs Thatcher s dream consigned to the dustbin of history I am prompted to ask this after Alliance Leicester s prediction that the buy to let market will grow by up to per cent in the next years In London To Let signs are now almost as numerous as For Sale signs particularly near good schools Anecdotal evidence suggests many homemovers are now trying to hold on to their previous home as a buy to let rather than sell it It suggests that in years to come the notion of selling your home may well be seen in the same way as giving away the family silver Kevin O Donnell is a freelance

The result he hopes will make more sense to students than high spoken ghosts from the past Iraq came to mind when I considered how teachers in high schools teach these day Holgate says The English Department works together with the History Department on various projects throughout the year When I mentioned the idea of Iraq to the teachers last fall they were quite excited and thought it would work well with their curriculum Holgate discovered that moving Italy to Iraq was no great leap The two warring families are at the heart of Romewo Juliet and the Shia Sunni divide in Iraq is something that we have all been living through over the last several years he said The characters also fell into place Capulet and Montague for example are rich businessmen Friar Laurence is Imam Laurence a government official and so on The biggest change was making Paris a contemporary of Capulet thereby making Juliet the victim of an arranged marriage Having said this the main focus of the play is still Romeo and Juliet Holgate s resume is impeccable and wide ranging He not only created the role of Richard Henry Lee on stage and in film but also directed the same show for NYSTI He also has a long career acting and directing in opera He says the latter experience in a world where other considerations sometimes trump text proved helpful in molding this piece Operatic versions did not follow Shakespeare word by word scene by scene They created their own version while keeping the soul of the original intact I felt free to move some scenes around and some dialogue too Holgate s cast includes Kate Hettesheimer as Juliet and Brian Nemiroff as Romeo Hettesheimer is an Albany High School graduate who interned at the institute during the season before moving on to Sarah Lawrence College and further studies at the British American Drama Academy She is now a professional actress in New York and a frequent guest artist at NYSTI Nemiroff who recently relocated from Manhattan to Saratoga Springs has already done Shakespeare at NYSTI starring as Malcolm in Macbeth He has also appeared with the now defunct Saratoga Shakespeare Company The director did need to give his players some specific advice Mostly I had to make sure that they are modern kids Juliet has been exposed to the Internet and she is trying to understand the world without She is attempting to overthrow the suffocating restrictions placed upon her by her parents His interpretation includes cutting out archaic expressions What is left is an easily understandable Romeo and Juliet which the students not to mention the adults will enjoy BOX At a glance Romeo and Juliet When Opens p m Saturday Where Schacht Fine Arts Center Russell Sage College Division St Troy Continues p m Friday and Saturday p m Sunday a m Tuesday through Friday Through March Tickets Info http www nysti org",0

Harry Samuel, chief executive of RBC Investor and Treasury Services (I&TS), revealed in an interview that his firm is investing some Ã‚Â£30 million to migrate clients in Australia to a global servicing platform and develop new middle office capabilities in the country. We re investing CAD million in upgrading the technology capability for that jurisdiction Samuel told Global Investor For outsourcing contracts for middle office what tends to happen is the service provider is just replicating in their own environment the same processes that were being done by the asset manager And we re taking that to a different level and creating an industrial product that uses the client s own data and provides a more consistent and scalable service he added For example the new offering will allow clients to access a wider range of information such as which brokers are processing their trades more quickly or are performing better in the face of increased volatility Samuel claimed RBC I TS expects to roll out the service in Australia first towards the end of and then extend it globally He said RBC saw a business opportunity Australia because rival service providers often use separate custody and fund administration systems for the local market instead of a single global platform It s an expensive system from a licence fee perspective and is not relevant once a fund manager wants to set up alternative domiciles for distribution Samuel added RBC I TS has already migrated its Australian clients to its global custody platform and is in the process of doing so for fund administration The custodian has now updated its strategy to include Australia on its list of top target jurisdictions along with Canada Luxembourg and Ireland We were operating in Australia but we were not investing anywhere near to the extent that we are now and we hadn t really spent time understanding the opportunities that existed in the Australian market when we set the strategy initially five years ago Samuel said David Travers managing director for RBC I TS in Australia told Global Investor the firm is targeting asset managers in the Australian market and expects strong growth coming from data services As with RBC I TS globally we re engaging with fast growing asset managers in Australia as they look to implement a clear strategy around data management he said RBC s custody arm holds some AUD billion billion in domestic and foreign securities for Australian investors according to June data from the Australian Custodial Services Association ACSA It uses a sub custodian to connect to the local settlement infrastructure In November RBC I TS poached JP Morgan veteran David Brown as its new head of global client coverage Australia Later that year the firm tapped Marian Azer as head of I TS product management for Asia Pacific and chief operating officer global client coverage in Australia RBC I TS has some staff in the Australian market and receives operational support from the firm s centre in Malaysia",0
Tasman District Council (Waimea Water Augmentation Scheme) Bill - Second Reading,Tasman District Council (Waimea Water Augmentation Scheme) Bill - Second Reading GINNY ANDERSEN Labour Thank you for the opportunity to speak on this important bill for Nelson and for the Waimea Plains I was lucky enough to be one of the members who travelled to Richmond to hear submissions for one full day from the community in terms of those that were going to directly benefit from this scheme and also those who were opposed So I m thankful for that opportunity and for those of the community who took their time to come forward and give their views On the day it was interesting to hear the background of this piece of legislation and the fact that there have been low water flows for some time in that river catchment which is well known as being the fruit bowl of one of the main areas of Nelson and it s sustained through those aquifers many agricultural industries over decades and decades within Zealand It is those aquifers that are we are advised under threat as a result of water depletion and that provides a threat not just to residential households having a security of supply of fresh water but also a lot of those agricultural businesses which people rely upon for jobs and much of the community relies upon strongly over a long period of time So this bill enables the construction of a dam that would enable that water to be built up and to replenish those aquifers In fact million cubic meters of reservoir are located behind the dam and that can be in fact released in a controlled manner during periods of high water demand and of low and natural river flows It s intended to be able to I guess replenish the Waimea Plains over that time It has been noted already today that the expert advice we received indicated that this was beneficial for the long term of that security of fresh water supply in that area In the transfer of land it s interesting to note and my colleague Stuart Nash has already mentioned that there is an impact on iwi that still requires final confirmation So the iwi affected within Te Tau Ihu are Ng ti K ata Ng ti Apa ki te R T Ng ti Kuia Rangit ne o Wairau Ng ti Toa Rangatira Ng ti R rua Ng ti Tama ki Te Tau Ihu and Te tiawa o Te Waka a M ui Those eight iwi need to have full written consent provided back to the Government to make sure that when you transfer land as this piece of legislation provides to do from Crown ownership which has a right of first refusal that that can be triggered So that land is being transferred to the Tasman District Council and the right of first refusal will be transferred along with it to local government So we need to be reassured that those eight iwi are comfortable with that transfer and that that does not provide any side issues or any other concerns around Treaty rights in that space It was really interesting to sit in in Richmond during that day and hear the full range of submissions and I would like to say that it was a pretty charged up day There were some pretty fired up people there and the Hon Dr Nick Smith s nodding because he actually took a few difficult people who were not so happy with the bill on that day so I was surprised he was smiling still at the end of the day But there was some pretty rigorous opposition to the construction of the dam in that area So the main argument made in support of this bill was the fact that it sustained the strong agricultural base that has been operating within this area for a long period of time and that that would be addressing critical water shortages That was seen by submitters as the best solution to provide security over the next one hundred years and more in that area The economic cost to the region of not proceeding with this scheme was also highlighted by a range of submitters and the concern that many of those businesses orchards apples would not be able to continue to thrive without that security of water supply Also a clear point that was made was ensuring that the needs of stakeholders and improving water quality would be reassured that by having the dam in place and replenishing those aquifers it would ensure that there was a high quality of water Another point made by I think Fish Game if I remember correctly was that while this legislation provides to transfer conservation land the Crown land it is a relatively small land and of limited conservation value One of the changes that was recommended and has been carried out is to ensure that there is access to the public That was raised by submitters on that day and we ve made sure that all possible actions are taken to ensure public access to that land It was interesting to hear from farmers who had been third and fourth generations who had continued to make a living on that land and to hear their concerns that they wanted to make sure that their businesses would continue to thrive in the future There were views from those who had businesses that there was adequate consultation carried out by the Tasman District Council but that funnily enough was the main protest point of those who did not want this bill to proceed There were deep concerns that the consultation process undertaken by the Tasman District Council was insufficient and submissions in fact raised concerns about that consultation process There was very strong opposition to the fact that people did not want this dam to proceed and I acknowledge those who took the time and were really passionate about this for the area not wanting to see it proceed A key component of that concern of not wanting the dam to proceed was opposition to the financial impact of the dam So submitters note that in recent years the estimated cost of building has surged from million to million and they are concerned that that will be borne by ratepayers who won t directly benefit from the construction of this dam In the words of some it was seen that those farmers on the land were benefiting from the ratepayers contribution to a dam that they would not see a direct benefit from The Waimea scheme is for the benefit of urban and commercial water supply and will have economic and environmental benefits for the local community particularly within the Tasman District Council but also in the Nelson City Council as well We take the view that if the Tasman District Council wishes to proceed with this and this is a local issue which has been voted on it is for the local community to determine the best way forward So the Waimea scheme has been controversial that s well noted and I saw that up close and personal on the day especially as to that cost But Labour s position has been that the future of the scheme is in local hands with it being over to the Tasman District Council and other local interests to decide whether the scheme proceeds or not This has been resolved by the Tasman District Council vote and I note that two votes were taken on August councillors voted by a narrow margin to abandon the project about the ballooning price but on September councillors voted in favour for the dam to proceed in light of the new funding model that had been reached after working with investors So the Government s financial support for the scheme is subject to normal contractual conditions being met and to financial close as has already been noted being reached by December and details need to be reached to work through this So it will be interesting to see whether we can continue to get all the paperwork completed in time and the final requirements for this bill to be done in the final members day of this sitting session So without further ado I wish all of the people in Tasman and the Nelson area all the best for the future with this exciting proposition I think it holds great promise for jobs for industry and for those that have farmed the land for a long time I commend this bill to the House,0

companies are a relatively new phenomena, dating perhaps from the market
highs of 2000. Over 15 years ago, in ""The Limits of Research: How
Valuable Are Analyst's Reports?"" (Barron's, May 18, 1987), I showed that
analyst recommendations exhibited price increases of only 54% of the
price increase of the DJIA and only 70% of the price increase of the S&P

The budget office report said the State Employees' Retirement System and the Public School Employees' Retirement System together have an unfunded liability of $41 billion. Growing pension costs could force spending cuts throughout the state budget according to the report a scenario made even worse by projections of higher spending on debt medical assistance and prisons Like an oncoming tidal wave pension costs threaten to overwhelm the general fund budget and the vital programs and services that it funds the report says The same dynamic is expected for public schools said the report which was published by Corbett s budget office Increasing pension contributions obligations will claim a greater and greater share of school district budgets crowding out funding for education whether it is direct classroom instruction sports facilities and maintenance and ultimately put pressure on districts to increase property taxes the budget office said The report says higher taxes should be off the table but reductions in prospective benefits for current employees should be considered Corbett a Republican has spoken repeatedly about his desire to address the problem which is a particular challenge because case law interpreting the state constitution has prevented curtailing pension benefits for current or retired state employees and teachers His office s report says without elaboration that the state can change components of current employees prospective benefits to conform with prior court determinations regarding deferred compensation It recounts how the problem began with the law that granted retroactive pension rate increases to state workers and teachers including even higher increases for the lawmakers That was followed by a cost of living increase for retirees and then by restructuring the state s contributions that delayed the true cost for another decade The pension systems investments were badly hammered when the technology and housing bubbles burst and they have struggled to recover A law made some structural changes including less generous benefits for new hires The state paid nearly billion into SERS and PSERS during the fiscal year that ended in June That figure is projected to pass billion next year and reach billion by SERS provides billion annually in benefits PSERS pays out billion About people are members a group that includes active employees retirees beneficiaries and others who are vested but inactive Messages seeking comment weren t immediately returned by spokespeople for the two funds and for the office of Budget Secretary Charles Zogby",0

While this opinion may be viewed simply as Fayette Resources failing to make an adequate record below the case also illustrates the confusion created by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court s decision in the Mesivtah case Mesivtah Eitz Chaim of Bobov Inc v Pike County Board of Assessment Appeals A d Pa which held that non profit entities must satisfy both the statutory requirements of the Purely Public Charity Act Charity Act codified at P S and the court established HUP test When the HUP test was developed by the Supreme Court in there was no statute implementing the charitable exemption for purely public charities under Article VIII Section a v of the Pennsylvania Constitution When the Charity Act was passed in however the legislature filled that void and created what should be the standard against which such questions are evaluated unless the statute itself is declared unconstitutional either on its face or as applied Instead in Mesivtah the Supreme Court required that entities meet both tests which can lead to inconsistent results as occurred here The Commonwealth Court recognized that Fayette Resources satisfies all of the statutory requirements imposed by the Charity Act nevertheless it overturned the exemption because it found that an element of the HUP test was not met Even apart from the dual standard itself it is troubling that Fayette Resources which provides staffed homes for the intellectually disabled who are legitimate subjects of charity is exempt from federal taxation relieves the government of the duty and burden to care for the intellectually disabled and has no private profit motive was found not to have established its entitlement to a real estate tax exemption because it did not show that its costs exceeded its revenues This rationale appears to conflict with the evidence that Fayette Resources is compensated by Medicaid payments that any surplus revenues are directed back into acquisition or fixing up of group homes and that distribution of any funds for a private purpose is prohibited by the organization s by laws Is the Court saying that an entity must lose money on a consistent basis to be entitled to a real estate tax exemption Must it solicit charitable contributions to establish its claim These are the types of questions the legislature answered in the Public Charity Act The Supreme Court s and here the Commonwealth Court s insistence on applying the less detailed court established standard of the HUP test in addition to the Public Charity Act standards only creates confusion and additional costs to charities who must repeatedly litigate the vagaries of the HUP test the very result the legislature attempted to avoid Disclaimer This Alert has been prepared and published for informational purposes only and is not offered nor should be construed as legal advice For more information please see the firm s full disclaimer Mr Philip Lebowitz Duane Morris LLP South th Street Philadelphia UNITED STATES E mail solutions duanemorris com URL www duanemorris com Click Here for related articles c Mondaq Ltd Tel http www mondaq com",0
"An East Bay winemaker accused his wife of hiring a private investigator to arrange his drunken driving arrest outside a Danville bar in January so she could gain leverage in a pending custody battle, according to a federal lawsuit filed Thursday.

Mitchell Katz, 48, who owns the eponymous Livermore winery, sued his wife of 19 years, Alicia Spenger, 46, and private investigator Christopher Butler, 50, in U.S. District Court for unspecified damages, claiming that his civil rights were violated when they conspired to have him arrested. Katz also named as defendants the Contra Costa County deputy sheriff who arrested him the city of Danville and a former Butler employee who has emerged as a key figure in the government s case against the former private eye It is probably the most mean spirited thing I ve seen one person do to another said Katz s attorney Brian Gearinger It s also probably the most corrupt thing I ve seen a peace officer do Katz s civil suit is the first filed by one of five Bay Area men who prosecutors say were targeted in the dirty DUI scam Authorities say Butler hired decoys including attractive women to ply men with alcohol and then coax them into cars sometimes with promises to rendezvous elsewhere Along the way a police officer working with Butler would pull over the targeted man on suspicion of drunken driving prosecutors believe A central player in the Katz sting was a former Butler employee named Carl Marino who later confessed his role in e mails sent to Katz two months after the winemaker s arrest Marino a former police officer from upstate New York was also working as a confidential informant for the Department of Justice at the time of Katz s arrest He helped the government build its corruption case against Butler and Norman Wielsch the former commander of a state Department of Justice drug task force according to court documents Butler and Wielsch were indicted by a federal grand jury in August for allegedly stealing drugs from evidence lockers and selling them According to Katz s lawsuit he asked for a divorce from Spenger in late October The couple have two sons Spenger hired Butler the next month according to a signed contract included in the lawsuit and paid him roughly to investigate her husband which included installing GPS equipment on his car Spenger would not comment when reached by telephone Butler s attorney William Gagen said he would not represent his client in a civil lawsuit but hoped depositions would lead to a finding of responsibility This will give everyone an opportunity to be interviewed and we can determine where culpability may lay Gagen said Including that of Mr Katz who was not forced to drink and drive According to the lawsuit in early January Marino posed as a television producer from the A E Network and said he was interested in meeting with Katz about a possible reality show about his winery On Jan Marino a second male conspirator and four women hired by Butler met Katz at the Vine wine bar on Hartz Avenue in downtown Danville As Marino conducted an interview with Katz the women joined the men at the table complimented the winemaker and made sure to keep his glass filled according to Katz s attorneys By the end of the evening Katz ended up consuming more alcohol than he otherwise would have knowingly consumed on this occasion Unbeknownst to him the premise for the meeting to discuss a reality television show was false After leaving the Vine Katz was pulled over and arrested by then Contra Costa County Deputy Sheriff Stephen Tanabe Prosecutors believe Tanabe was tipped by Butler to arrest Katz In April Tanabe pleaded not guilty to accepting a bribe from Butler to make a DUI arrest He is free on bail Dan Russo Tanabe s attorney called the filing against his client misguided If Mitch Katz had killed someone after he got behind the wheel he would have been the defendant in this case he said In March one month after Butler and Wielsch were arrested on drug and conspiracy charges Marino replied to an e mail from Katz and apologized for his role in what he described as the set up and hoped that Katz could one day forgive him As you can see I never wanted to be involved in Butler s shady activities and that is why I put an end to them and also let the DOJ know what was done to you and others Marino wrote according to e mails in Katz s lawsuit I hope you can forgive me and understand that ultimately I was the good guy in this",0

Q. I came home from work early and found my wife with another man. I told her I wanted a divorce and asked her to move out. She refused and now has decided that since everything is out in the open that she will have her lover over anytime she wants. I can't afford to move out of the house. What can I do? This is unbearable, and the divorce will take months. A You should hire a lawyer and file for divorce as soon as possible Once the divorce gets started you can seek a temporary court order giving you exclusive use of the house If the judge isn t willing to deny her access to the home you can request in the alternative that she not be allowed to have her boyfriend over for visits Q I live in a townhome and have a standard homeowners policy with high deductibles My neighbor broke a pipe in his house and the flood seeped under the walls and into mine We have the same insurance company The company paid for my damage but only after the deductible amount Since it was my neighbor s fault why should the deductible apply A The reason you had to pay your deductible is probably because your insurance company put your claim under your insurance policy and not your neighbor s If you and your neighbor had different insurance companies your neighbor s policy most likely would have paid for your damages and you wouldn t have had to pay a deductible Your insurance company would have worked diligently on your behalf to make sure it didn t have to pay for your damages However having the same insurance company as your neighbor and possibly having the same adjuster means that your carrier had to pay for your damages and your neighbor s damages and the company would prefer for both you and your neighbor to pay deductibles Start by calling your adjuster to see if the claim can be switched to your neighbor s policy if it hasn t been already with you being issued a check for your deductible If the adjuster doesn t budge you have two choices You can sue your neighbor If the amount of your deductible is under you can sue in small claims court without a lawyer Your own insurance company will defend your neighbor and be obligated to pay you the deductible if you win your lawsuit Or you could file a complaint with the Texas Department of Insurance The department has a program to help consumers resolve disputes with insurance companies Call or visit www tdi state tx us for information Q When we got married my husband and I informally agreed that he would make the monthly payment on my existing mortgage and I would pay for groceries utilities and household expenses Things are not going very well in our marriage If we divorce can he claim my home now as community property A No he can t Because you owned the home before you got married you own it as your separate property Getting married doesn t make the home community property Even if your husband made those payments from his own checking account the home is still your separate property All your husband has is an equitable interest in the property That means the amount he is entitled to receive if you divorce is generally equal to half of the principal payments applied to the mortgage during the marriage plus or minus a proportionate amount of the appreciation or depreciation in the home s value Of course calculating his interest is not that simple For instance your husband may have used some of his separate property to pay the mortgage Texas has a complex statutory formula to determine the value of your husband s equitable interest Q I m required to make child support payments to my ex wife but I recently lost my job Is there a way for me to temporarily suspend my payments until I get a new job A Probably not You could go back to court and seek a modification of your court ordered child support payments But by the time you get your case heard you may either already have a new job or you may be so far behind in your payments that you could be in a worse predicament You could also talk to your ex wife and try to informally agree on a modified payment plan The best approach may be to pay as much as you can each month That way you ll later be able to make a fairly good argument that you were trying as hard as possible to make the payments even though you didn t have a job at the time But don t forget two important points Interest adds up quickly on unpaid and underpaid amounts And people who don t make their child support payments can get thrown in jail",0

Dissatisfied customers abound and nefarious practices multiply, yet the bosses of the big banks report record profits.

The Bank of England's decision to raise base rates last week may have wrongfooted its banking brethren, but the response has been typical. The banks are displaying their customary unwillingness to pass on the upside of the base-rate cut to savers, while acting swiftly to pass on the full-rate rise to borrowers. Banking customers would perhaps forgive these lapses if they received good service from the dominant financial institution in their lives As we report on page several studies show that poor service is rampant and banking customers are not happy The music my bank plays while I am on hold makes me want to rip out my own eardrums Many of you it seems feel the same But bad service and the iniquitous tweaking of interest rates pale beside the worst of the banks products payment protection insurance PPI is sold alongside loans credit cards and mortgages Theoretically it pays out if you can t make payments but it is riddled with exclusions and premiums reaped by the banks far outweigh claims paid Consumer groups view PPI as an expensive moneyspinner which preys on customers fears of over indebtedness to boost the banks coffers A continuing study of PPI at the Office of Fair Trading this week produced a summary of its research so far PPI which is sold alongside loans and credit cards is expensive poorly explained and used as a tool to subsidise cheap deals at the expense of unwitting customers The OFT is yet to decide whether it will take any action to curb the banks excesses Here at Money we are in favour of the banks making profits and paying lovely dividends into our pension funds But if your bank is pushing PPI on you keeping you on hold for days and pocketing the benefits of the base rate cuts at your expense it is time to bin your bank c Times Newspapers Ltd",0

Unfortunately, there is only so much that the town can cut in terms of costs. At a meeting at the end of October council talked about how the town is trying to collect a number of delinquent payments on water service The next move was to start taking people to magistrate court to continue to pursue the money owed to the town The town started by contacting a group of people with the most recent delinquent payments totaling Council member Bill McCombs said Monday that the debt the town incurred with those unpaid water bills should have never been allowed to get that high He pointed out that the town has done a lot in the past six or seven months to make improvements to the water service The town has to do its part and not just pass on the debt to the people McCombs said Also during the meeting council made a decision to move forward with installing a new furnace in one of its buildings The furnace in the shop which is located on the other side of the parking lot from the town hall is very old and is not efficient Employees work out of the shop and equipment is also kept there Replacing the furnace would be a way to cut down on expenses by lowering the gas bills Vandetta said Monongah received a bid for for this project By unanimous vote council approved putting a new furnace in the shop using money from the town s Community Partnership Grant Vandetta explained that Monongah has left of this grant and needs to use the money soon because the grant time frame has already been extended several times In the spring the town also plans to use the remaining funds to work on the air conditioning in the town hall and make repairs to a wall in the building he said In addition community member Chris Martin provided an update on Monongah Hometown Christmas which will take place Dec She said the small parade will begin at p m with units lining up at p m and will feature Santa and the North Marion High School band A variety of entertainment as well as refreshments will follow at the town hall Martin said the planning committee has been trying to get the word out about the event and people have been helping out by giving donations for the cause Monongah Middle School Y Teens North Marion and West Virginia University students and other volunteers met at the Monongah Fire Department on Nov to stuff stockings for the festivities I think everybody s really enthusiastic about it she said In other news Council member Warren Sloan is working to submit a lengthy application for the National Guard to use the town s proposed skateboard park and playground project as a training program He said Monongah feels very fortunate that this project is on the list of the National Guard who would get the property ready and move the dirt at no cost to the town Sloan has run into some complications regarding the ownership of the property which the National Guard needs to know and is trying to get answers He said if this project comes together and works it would provide a play area for the youth and the whole community and would better the town Monongah resident Barbara Carpenter expressed her frustrations about her yard and basement being flooded because of rainwater coming from a drain on property that slopes toward her home After a discussion of the problem Vandetta suggested that a curb be placed on the side of the road to divert the waters and council will look into this option Council members unanimously passed the second reading of an ordinance to increase the pay of the town fire chief Email Jessica Borders at jborders timeswv com or follow her on Twitter JBordersTWV",0

So far this year, $3 billion worth of CLOs have sold--a substantial drop from the pre-crisis era when more than $90 billion were sold. CLOs which helped fuel the leveraged buyout market in the mid s virtually disappeared after they and other so called structured investment vehicles were blamed for the near collapse of the financial system But in today s ultra low interest rate environment investors want higher yields even if it means making riskier bets Regulators though would like banks to keep some CLO collateral on their books rather than passing on all of the risk to investors This might decrease the attractiveness of CLOs for the banks when the regulations change Until then as markets have recovered since the credit crisis CLOs have proven to be an attractive investment said Jaime Aldama head of U S Credit Structuring at Barclays Capital in New York Investors are looking for access to floating rate credit and outside of leveraged loans there aren t many assets that provide that The revival in the CLO market albeit small should boost speculative grade rated corporate borrowers which rely on high risk high yield leveraged loans ranging from car makers to airlines and leveraged buyout firms Last week Symphony Asset Management LLC priced a million collateralized loan obligation a security backed primarily by a diversified pool of leveraged loans The biggest part of the deal a million triple A rated year slice was priced at its pre offer estimate of basis points over the London interbank offered rate ING Alternative Asset Management s million CLO is scheduled to price this week At this rate new CLOs will total about billion in up from billion last year according to Standard Poor s Leveraged Commentary Data There is increased investor appetite for the senior most triple A rated tranches because of the yield they provide said Justin Pauley CLO desk strategist at RBS in Stamford Conn The higher rated portions are typically purchased by banks insurance companies and asset managers he said as CLO prices have tightened in except for short periods of volatility due to concerns over European sovereign debt and disasters in Japan At the beginning of the year the senior most tranche could be placed at around basis points over Libor but in a matter of a few months this has gone to basis points over Libor Pauley said Recent triple A rated CLO tranches may be more attractive to investors as they have been rated recently when rating standards have been higher he noted Large U S insurance companies and Japanese asset managers which had gravitated to only the safest investments after the credit crisis are gradually starting to regain an appetite for risk and are driving much of the demand for the latest vintage of CLOs Aldama said These accounts tend to focus primarily on the AAA level of CLO while hedge funds and private equity firms are the primary buyers of the mezzanine tranches Aldama added Despite the recent interest issuance is a far cry from the heady days before the crisis In CLOs valued at billion were priced according to data from RBS That figure fell to million in So far this year CLOs valued at about billion have sold It s unlikely that we ll see an explosion of issuance Aldama said With about seven deals worth around million sold in We wouldn t be surprised to see another to deals this year he said At that run rate we could reach billion for the year Anusha Shrivastava covers high yield debt leveraged finance and credit markets for Dow Jones Newswires She can be reached at or by email at anusha shrivastava dowjones com TALK BACK We invite readers to send us comments on this or other financial news topics Please email us at TalkbackAmericas dowjones com Readers should include their full names work or home addresses and telephone numbers for verification purposes We reserve the right to edit and publish your comments along with your name we reserve the right not to publish reader comments ET",0

Designed by Delano & Aldrich, an architecture firm known for building houses for the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Astors and Whitneys, the houses consist of a larger main home that is connected in several places to an adjacent smaller home with a large garage. Both are perfectly preserved with all original architectural details, fixtures and fittings, said listing agent Joshua Wesoky of Compass.","On New York's Upper East Side, a pair of Georgian-style townhomes built around 1930 by the family of one of the world's richest menÃ¢â‚¬â€and more recently owned by the late investment banker and preservationist Richard H.

Designed by Delano & Aldrich, an architecture firm known for building houses for the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, Astors and Whitneys, the houses consist of a larger main home that is connected in several places to an adjacent smaller home with a large garage. Both are perfectly preserved with all original architectural details, fixtures and fittings, said listing agent Joshua Wesoky of Compass. A trip to the houses feels like stepping into the s A collector of thousands of antiques many American and most from the early th century Mr Jenrette filled both homes with portraits landscape paintings urns clocks carpets chandeliers and porcelain dinner services An architectural enthusiast he bought and renovated more than a dozen mansions in his lifetime Mr Jenrette attributed the beginnings of his obsession with old houses to watching Gone with the Wind too many times as a teenager growing up in Raleigh N C Restoring fine old homes to their former glory has been a hobby some say a passion of mine he wrote in his book Adventures with Old Houses A disease might be a more accurate description Friends have described me as a house aholic who can t say no to a fine old house that has fallen on hard times The main house at East rd Street is long and narrow spanning the width of just one room across the front but extending back feet to the rear It has foot ceilings and tall English Regency style windows A grand circular staircase at the center of the property connects the four stories while a decorative skylight at the top floods the middle of the house with light The homes were owned by the late Richard H Jenrette an investment banker and preservationist PHOTO Dorothy Hong for The Wall Street Journal The entire first floor is fitted in beige and brown marble including a grand oval dining room with chocolate brown walls a white marble mantel and wall niches for displaying carved classical busts of British prime ministers An early th century French Empire chandelier hangs over the table There is also a formal library with a marble mantel late th century Irish Georgian bookcases and a writing desk There is a large salon style entertaining room on the third floor with its own marble mantel and dramatic chandelier The second floor of the house is used as a library the full foot span is covered in walls of Mr Jenrette s books Even the kitchens are original The larger of the two kitchens in the main house is on the basement level and was designed in the early th century for a household with staff A buyer could more thoroughly combine the houses and would likely remodel them to include a more modern kitchen Mr Wesoky said The carriage house includes a large garage that can accommodate five cars The main house was built for George F Baker Sr who had made his fortune in railroads and banking in the late s and was a close friend and business partner of J P Morgan He is also known for having given a grant for the construction of Harvard Business School Mr Baker s son built the home for his aging father who died before it was completed It was an attractive history to Mr Jenrette who attended Harvard Business School and went on to become one of the founders of investment bank Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette and to head Equitable Life Assurance Society He wrote that Mr Baker whose name was on his acceptance letter to Harvard Business School was one of his larger than life heroes in the business world Mr Jenrette actually owned the main house twice He first bought the house for million in October according to his book Within a week after the purchase the stock market crashed and a little over a year later he agreed to sell the house for million After the sale he downsized to the smaller adjacent home with the garage at East rd Street which at the time wasn t connected to the main home He lived in the adjacent home for about seven years before the main house again became available for a discounted price of million He then decided to buy it back and reunite the two buildings He lived there until his death in at Mr Jenrette didn t have any children His longtime partner William L Thompson died in The properties are being sold by the Classical American Homes Preservation Trust a nonprofit foundation set up by Mr Jenrette to protect four th century properties he owned in New York North Carolina and South Carolina They include Edgewater an Classical Revival mansion on the Hudson River Mr Jenrette came across that property on a warm September afternoon in and quickly agreed to buy it from Gore Vidal The Wall Street Journal reported The trust s president Robert Leath said the organization is selling the townhouses because they aren t core to the group s mission The trust will instead focus on preserving and protecting classical American architecture of the first half of the th century Proceeds from the sale will be invested in the establishment of permanent funds to support historic preservation and education Mr Leath said Mr Jenrette s furniture and antiques will be addressed separately and are not included in the sale of the house Mr Leath said The other homes administered by the trust include

He says There are huge bargains for passengers opting for a mid week flight over a weekend flight Anecdotally I know from friends and family that they have a good amount of leave to take before the end of the calendar or financial year and there are some great value flights for passengers to take advantage of over the next few months Stephen s top tips Choose a mid week flight There are huge savings to be made by booking mid week flights versus weekend flights The airlines team at Gatwick have crunched the numbers to identify savings in the region of on a return flight in some cases when opting for a mid week departure Pack a hand luggage size suitcase Most airlines will let passengers take on one carry on piece of luggage included in the ticket price and then will charge for any further pieces of luggage So avoid any additional charges on your ticket by just taking the one carry on suitcase Take that city break in winter rather than summer There are savings of up to to be made taking a city break in a winter month over a summer month A winter trip also provides the opportunity to see the key sights out of the hustle and bustle of the busy summer months See also M road works what is a smart motorway Gatwick route to get this electric double decker bus Girls night out was truly special thanks to stranger s kindness You don t have to be flying first class to get the airport lounge experience Gatwick has a No Lounge in both its North and South terminals where any passenger can take advantage of unlimited food and drink watch TV or browse one of the many magazines available whilst of course stocking up on some magazine reading material for your flight Passengers booking the lounge in advance of their trip can save and it s also well worth booking in advance to avoid disappointment Dress to impress Putting on a smart outfit rather than your comfy tracksuit really does stand you a better chance of being upgraded into the next class of cabin This is especially important if you are travelling on your own as it s easier logistically to move a couple of people around the plane rather than a larger group Consider booking your return flight with a different airline There is no need to book a return flight with the same airline as your outbound flight More than one airline might offer flights to your destination so it s worth taking a look to see if you can save money flying to your destination on one airline and back with a different airline",0

MANY years ago, as branch manager of a large Australian bank, part of my job was to vet home loan applications.    Such were the principles and strictly enforced guidelines of the then big four banks and the Reserve Bank s oversight of their lending activities that a home loan application was not a fait accompli Issues such as ability to repay equity in the proposed purchase career prospects and the quality and value of the property were taken into account The system worked well for the banks and their customers with defaults on home loans almost unheard of and mortgages usually repaid within years So bearing in mind the American fiasco it was with some professional interest that under the guise of a year old wage earner of indeterminate occupation I embarked upon what I expected to be mission impossible scoring a home loan mortgage without having the readies to pay a deposit needing to borrow separately to scrape up enough to pay stamp duty legals and mortgage insurance and willing to contribute per cent or more of my net weekly wage to cover the repayments To sweeten the deal I mentioned that my parents pensioners owned their home had some cash reserves and no borrowings and were happy to assist me by offering their guarantee or putting their own home up as additional security I contacted all the major banking institutions and several large regional building societies All fell over themselves to sign me up Most banks were prepared to lend per cent of the purchase price Building societies were a little more constrained offering up to per cent My mention of the probability of Reserve Bank interest increases property value downturns loss or reduction of income recession and illness were all dismissed When I suggested that by borrowing per cent of the price let alone per cent at first interest charge the loan amount would exceed the value of the house I was told that that was just arithmetic Because of the degraded security quality of many Australian lending institutions home loan portfolios the situation in our own prime home loan markets is remarkably consistent with the US subprime loan market It s time the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority took a closer and more public look at our lending institutions in particular those smaller regional societies that cannot hedge their home loan risks by offsetting them against other loan portfolios or business units John Smeaton Newcastle",0

The Denver Post asked the Denver Metro Association of Realtors, Zillow, Trulia, Redfin and a Boulder firm, Zavvie, to rank the most robust ZIP codes and neighborhoods for home price and sales gains this year. The areas that showed up the most often on the various rankings were included on the list below of the hottest neighborhoods. Price gains were a big determinant but so too were the the volume of sales and the number of days on the market Higher mortgage rates the limited inventory of homes for sale and higher prices are all weighing on home sales this year But these eight ZIP codes remain popular with buyers Hampden South Southmoor Park Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market Wider streets bigger lots and more square footage in short suburbia in the city are what the homes in southeast Denver s Hampden South and Southmoor Park neighborhoods have to offer And while that might not appeal to young buyers wanting a hip address attitudes can change as kids start showing up Once they have that second child the Washington Park bungalow doesn t work as much anymore said Adam Haman a real estate investor and broker associate with HomeSmart Cherry Creek Younger adults who made well timed purchases in older neighborhoods like Platte Park are among those searching the area for larger four and five bedroom homes Investors are active too buying homes built in the s and s from the original owners or their heirs and rehabilitating them Through April the annual price gains are the the highest of any Zip code in the metro area at just shy of percent Despite that the homes are still priced below the median for the overall market Lowry Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market Properties in this former military base on Denver s east side carry the heftiest price tags of any hot neighborhood at Despite that the number of sales isn t slowing as is the case in most areas but accelerating by nearly half That s due to a surge in new high end homes hitting the market Lowry is developing its last parcel on the former site of the Air Force Accounting Building under the name Boulevard One Condos in the mixed product community start in the to range townhomes go in the range and single family homes command million to million said Derek Camunez owner of Re Max Avenues in Denver Lowry residents have shown a tendency to stay put or relocate within the neighborhood which gives new home sales a disproportionate impact and contributed to a whopping percent gain in the median price and a percent jump in sales versus last year These new properties are pulling up Lowry in general said Camunez a long time Lowry resident Valverde Overland Athmar Park Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market Buyers searching for a mix of affordability on larger lots continue to flock to Denver s southwest neighborhoods That has pushed up home prices nearly percent year over year in the ZIP code up percent in which covers Fort Logan and Harvey Park South and percent in which includes Westwood Harvey Park and Mar Lee In the median price of a home sold which was still under early last year is now at Valverde Overland and Athmar Park are full of smaller ranch homes built in the s to s Don t expect the walkability and charm offered in Denver s oldest neighborhoods but the trade off is relative affordability Most of my clients are first time homebuyers We can still manage to get them in at under And it takes five days to get a home under contract if it is priced correctly said Graeme Nistler an agent with Redfin The area is home to several parks and rolling hills that provide for unparalleled views More cultural amenities are showing up chief among them the Levitt Pavilion Denver a capacity nonprofit outdoor amphitheater in Ruby Hill North Aurora Delmar Highland Park Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market Years ago pundits predicted the Anschutz Medical Campus would transform the struggling north Aurora neighborhoods surrounding it and it is finally happening Jaryd Takushi a broker associate with Kentwood City Properties picked up a gross foreclosure near th Avenue and Joliet St for during the housing crash in After major upgrades and strong price appreciation he estimates it could sell for The area is populated with smaller ranch style homes some with basements some without Many are in disrepair due to neglect or heavy wear as rentals But a transformation is under way The blocks to the east of Peoria Street have attracted medical residents interns nurses and other healthcare workers They can walk across the street Takushi said The Stanley Marketplace about three miles to the west of Anschutz is driving interest in the homes surrounding in that area as Stapleton to the north and west gets built out Light rail links to downtown and the airport in the area are another draw said Takushi who personally takes advantage of those connections Globeville River North North Washington Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market Gentrification is scouring the Denver side of the ZIP code like a tsunami It is a weird area concedes Michael Steffen an agent with Generation Property Group with Exit Realty Cherry Creek Dilapidated homes available for under in Globeville list alongside million condos in River North both surrounded by warehouses and heavy industry Steffen said it is one of the few places where he advises clients to test the soil before they buy given the legacy of contamination And yet buyers can t seem to resist the hot mess They are very old homes and not many of them were well built to begin with Steffen said of the small properties originally crafted for factory workers Investors banking on future price appreciation are active in the area The National Western complex will undergo a billion rebuild and expansion River North has become the place to hang out And the rebuild of Interstate promises to remove viaducts and open the area up Still Steffen laments the fate of the original families some with roots across generations as one of Denver s last remaining pockets of affordability gets bulldozed Heather Gardens Windsor Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market Baby Boomers who constitute a disproportionate share of Denver s population may be young at heart but not necessarily in age That might help explain why a ZIP code with a dense concentration of senior housing made the hottest list Windsor Gardens is full of age restricted condos and townhomes and nearby areas are heavy with attached housing which more buyers are seeking as they try to leave renting behind The median price in the area is still a relatively low even after a percent run up University Park Observatory Park Wellshire Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market The ZIP code includes several neighborhoods built around parks and homes range from the rough edged student rentals around the University of Denver to stately manses that top million at Observatory Park which has seen a wave of scrapes Home prices are up percent year over year not the biggest jump but still impressive for a ZIP code where the median price is More people are working from home or telecommuting People want to be able to walk out their front door and have a great place to go to for lunch or breakfast The area has become more walkable You have all of these neighborhood charms while still being close to the city said Libby Levinson a broker with Kentwood Cherry Creek She has also noticed another trend residents from even wealthier parts of the metro area downsizing to smaller homes in the area Roxborough Chatfield Median price Change in median price Change in sold listings Average days on market Homes in the ZIP code nestled up against the foothills in the far southwest corner of the metro area in Jefferson County don t come cheap But they offer more bang for the buck than Denver s pricier neighborhoods For million up here you would spend million to million in the city said Todd Cole a Re Max Professionals agent who together with his wife Tracy has sold homes in the area for nearly three decades The trade off Longer drives into the city and less commercial development The payoff Being closer to nature and the foothills and golf courses On the high end is Ravenna a newer community where homes start at million and up Existing custom homes in the older Roxborough area come in at around Joining the two gated golf course communities is Sterling

 The investment strategies of the Swiss wealthy are now available to all thanks to the work of Max Heinrich who has studied their principles of making money He has called these principles the Zurich Axioms Here they are ON RISK Worry is not a sickness but a sign of health if you are not worried you are not risking enough Always play for meaningful stakes if an amount is so small that its loss won t make any significant difference then it isn t likely to bring any significant gains either Resist the allure of diversification ON GREED Always take your profit too soon Decide in advance what gain you want from a venture and when you get it get out ON HOPE When the ship starts sinking don t pray Jump Accept small losses cheerfully as a fact of life Expect to experience several while awaiting a large gain ON FORECASTS Human behaviour cannot be predicted Distrust anyone who claims to know the future however dimly ON PATTERNS Chaos is not dangerous until it starts to look orderly Beware the historian s trap it is based on the age old but entirely unwarranted belief that the orderly repetition of history allows for accurate forecasting in certain situations Beware the chartist s illusion it is characteristic of human minds to perceive links of cause and effect where none exist Beware the gambler s fallacy there s no such thing as Today s my lucky day or I m hot tonight ON MOBILITY Avoid putting down roots They impede motion Do not become trapped in a souring venture because of sentiments like loyalty and nostalgia Never hesitate to abandon a venture if a more attractive one comes along ON INTUITION A hunch can be trusted if it can be explained Never confuse a hunch with a hope ON THE OCCULT If astrology worked all astrologers would be rich A superstition need not be exorcised It can be enjoyed provided it is kept in its place ON OPTIMISM AND PESSIMISM Optimism means expecting the best but confidence means knowing how you will handle the worst Never make a move if you are merely optimistic ON CONSENSUS Disregard the majority opinion It is probably wrong Never follow speculative fads Often the best time to buy something is when nobody else wants it ON STUBBORNNESS If it doesn t pay off the first time forget it Never try to save a bad investment by averaging down ON PLANNING Long range plans engender the dangerous belief that the future is under control It is important never to take your own long range plans or other people s seriously In essence these axioms point to the benefit of having an investment strategy and sticking to it regardless of what other investors say or do If you don t have an investment strategy you could do worse than adopt these principles However don t be afraid to add or subtract ones according to what works for you DAVID McEWEN is an investment adviser and author of weekly share market newsletter McEwen s Investment Report He is commissioned by the New Zealand Stock Exchange to write an independent personal investment column He can be reached by email at davidm mcewen co nz or by mail care of this newspaper",0

This important legislation would authorize federal agencies to reemploy retired federal employees on a limited basis, without forcing the employee to take a reduction in salary corresponding to their retirement annuity. This legislation would prove vital as the federal government loses many of its skilled experienced senior employees said Senator Collins Nearly federal retirees have returned to work on a full time basis demonstrating the importance of these experience employees to federal operations This legislation would provide agencies with needed flexibility to bring retirees experience back into the federal workforce for limited time which is especially needed now given the expertise the government will need to effectively implement the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of Giving the government the flexibility to call on retired federal workers will help slow the government s impending brain drain This bill will ensure that our most experienced federal employees will be paid fairly for their continued contributions said Special Committee on Aging Chairman Kohl To effectively oversee stimulus spending Inspectors General will have to quickly hire experienced auditors and investigators This legislation would allow IG offices to bring back experienced employees to the federal government to ensure aggressive oversight enhanced transparency and accountability for taxpayer dollars At a Committee hearing earlier this month Acting Comptroller General Gene Dodaro testified that the reemployment of annuitants is an essential authority that the Government Accountability Office utilizes when circumstances call for rapid staffing increases The federal government currently loses over employees per year to retirement The Office of Personnel Management OPM estimates that percent of the current federal workforce of three million will be eligible to retire in the next ten years At present if a federal retiree returns to work on a part time basis they must take a pay reduction to offset their federal retirement annuity Under the legislation reemployment would be limited to a maximum of hours days in the first six months following retirement hours days in any month period and a total of hours days for any one employee While the returning annuitants would receive both salary and annuity payments they would not be considered employees for the purposes of retirement and would receive no additional retirement benefits based on their service The legislation was endorsed by the National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association NARFE the Partnership for Public Service and the Government Managers Coalition In a letter to Senator Collins NARFE President Margaret Baptiste noted Federal retirees should receive the full salary of their new job without any offset against the retirement annuities they earned through prior federal service Your bill is a welcomed expansion of this access TNS CT StaffFurigay",0

"Researchers found a decline in assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation combined with a change in asset allocations, resulting in a higher expected real return, has increased costs for public pensions, but the increase is much smaller than if the decline in the assumed return was due to a lower assumed real return.

In the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis, global interest rates and inflation have remained low by historic standards, and these low interest rates, along with low rates of projected global economic growth, have led to reductions in projected returns for most asset classes, which, in turn, have resulted in an unprecedented number of reductions in the investment return assumption used by public pension plans.","Researchers found a decline in assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation combined with a change in asset allocations, resulting in a higher expected real return, has increased costs for public pensions, but the increase is much smaller than if the decline in the assumed return was due to a lower assumed real return.

In the wake of the 2008-09 financial crisis, global interest rates and inflation have remained low by historic standards, and these low interest rates, along with low rates of projected global economic growth, have led to reductions in projected returns for most asset classes, which, in turn, have resulted in an unprecedented number of reductions in the investment return assumption used by public pension plans. Among the plans the National Association of State Retirement Administrators NASRA measured in nearly three fourths reduced their investment return assumption since fiscal year A brief from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College says such a change is generally viewed as a positive development for pension funding discipline bringing assumptions more in line with market expectations and forcing plan sponsors to increase annual required contributions However the researchers say the decline in assumed rates of return is actually due to lower assumed inflation not a lower assumed real return that is the return net of inflation In a fully indexed system where benefits fully adjust with inflation a lower inflation assumption should actually have no impact on costs however public pension plans have also changed their asset allocations resulting in a higher expected real return which lowers costs Therefore a quick assessment of these underlying assumption changes suggests that plans may have actually lowered their costs with the decline in the assumed return the brief says But public plan benefits are not fully indexed so the real value of benefits increases as the inflation expectation drops which increases plan costs The researchers explain that for a hypothetical plan where benefits fully adjust with inflation lower inflation will have no impact on the required contribution because the lower revenue produced by lower nominal returns will be offset by a decrease in initial benefits through lower wage growth and the cost of living adjustment COLA paid after retirement However the actual situation for public plans differs in two ways Benefits before and after retirement are not fully linked to inflation so they do not decline one to one with lower inflation therefore increasing the real value of benefits and increasing plan costs and public plans have shifted into riskier assets which increases their expected real return and reduces costs Public plans may seem like fully indexed systems because they provide benefits based on final earnings and offer post retirement COLAs the brief says But in reality not all benefits are based on final earnings and most COLAs are not designed to fully compensate for inflation It further explains that if all public sector workers remained with their employer until they retired their final earnings would reflect inflation and real wage growth over their work lives and their initial benefits based on final earnings would be fully indexed however of employees who vest in a pension benefit do not retire as public sector employees so they receive much lower benefits for their time in the public sector than employees who finish their career in the public sector The only way for a worker who leaves public sector employment before retirement to avoid a loss in benefits would be for the plan to base pension benefits on projected age earnings that is index earnings for inflation and real wage growth Without such indexing benefits erode in real terms and the higher the rate of inflation the larger the erosion With a lower rate of inflation the cost to the employer increases by making the deferred benefits relatively more expensive In addition the researchers say most COLAs are deliberately designed not to fully match inflation and some plans provide no COLA or only ad hoc adjustments meaning the benefits of many retirees erode in value over time with rising inflation When the inflation rate declines since the drop in benefit payouts does not fully reflect the drop in inflation costs rise At the extreme for plans without a COLA a percentage point reduction in assumed inflation produces a percentage point increase in real post retirement benefits The lack of complete indexing of both initial benefits and benefits after retirement means that a change in inflation is not a wash Instead as inflation declines real costs increase the brief explains At the same time public pension plans have also shifted their investment mix out of fixed income and into riskier asset classes with higher expected real returns which all else equal leads to lower costs as fewer contributions are required to meet future benefit obligations Using data reported under the new Government Accounting Standards Board GASB statements the researchers calculated the net effect on plan costs due to the lower inflation assumption and higher expected real return assuming a percentage point decrease in inflation and a percentage point increase in the real return They found a change in accrued liabilities and a roughly increase in employee liabilities and the associated normal costs In addition using these assumptions a plan s required contribution would increase by of payroll However lowering assumed rates of return due to lower assumed inflation was actually better for plans than if they did so due to a lower assumed real return because the researchers found that under a hypothetical scenario in which lower assumed returns are driven by a reduction in the assumed real return the increase in the required contribution would be over three times as high at of payroll",0

"A legal battle in New York highlights an aspect of estate planning that often gets little attention from people writing wills or agreeing to help settle an estate: the fees for the executors, writes Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com. Earlier this month, New York's attorney general challenged the proposed fee on the estate of Leona Helmsley, who owned a vast real-estate portfolio at the time of her death nine years ago. The $100 million sought by the executors is ""astronomical"" and should be cut, potentially by about 90%, the office of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said. Many states have a sliding scale of fees based on estate size; on a $1 million estate, the fee is often around $30,000, or 3%, says Hugh Magill, chief fiduciary officer at Northern Trust. Some people try to cap the fee below the amount allowed by statute, but that isn't always a good idea, says New York lawyer Steve Breitstone.","A legal battle in New York highlights an aspect of estate planning that often gets little attention from people writing wills or agreeing to help settle an estate: the fees for the executors, writes Wealth Adviser at WSJ.com.

Columbia University in New York is among the defendants named in the lawsuit. PHOTO: Desiree Rios for The Wall Street Journal The Justice Department weighed in Thursday on an antitrust lawsuit against colleges and universities challenging the schools legal arguments in a request to dismiss the case The lawsuit filed in Illinois federal court in January and seeking class action status names as defendants prestigious institutions including Columbia University Vanderbilt University and the University of Chicago According to the suit the schools engaged in price fixing and unfairly limited aid by using a shared methodology to calculate applicants financial need Schools are allowed under federal law to collaborate on their formulas but only if they don t consider applicants financial need in admissions decisions The suit alleges these schools do weigh candidates ability to pay in certain circumstances for instance by giving an edge to donor families or when pulling applicants off a waitlist and therefore shouldn t be eligible for the antitrust exemption In a court filing known as a statement of interest the Justice Department pushed back on the schools claim that they re protected as unwitting conspirators unaware that other member schools aren t need blind How Are You Paying for School About million borrowers hold trillion in federal student debt making student debt forgiveness a potent issue ahead of the midterm elections Download free WSJ s Guide to Student Loans Navigating the Myths and Misunderstandings About College Debt That argument stretches the Exemption beyond its text the Justice Department wrote in the filing referring to the loophole covering need blind schools The government added that it s irrelevant whether particular schools knew if other institutions were need blind The Justice Department s filing doesn t explicitly back the plaintiffs it just urges the judge to not throw the case out at this stage The government s filing says it offers no view on the factual claims or other motions to dismiss the case filed by Yale University Brown University Emory University Johns Hopkins University and the University of Chicago A court hearing is set for next month to address the schools efforts to dismiss the case Justice Department Urges Judge Not to Dismiss College Financial Aid Antitrust Case",0
"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Summertime, and the scamming is easy.

The North American Securities Administrators Association issued a warning last week about summer scams, suggesting that investors protect themselves against ""hot energy-related tips, speculative real estate promotions, unsolicited invitations from new online 'friends,' and complex, opaque investment products that fail to offer clear disclosures of their risks and costs.""","BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Summertime, and the scamming is easy.

The North American Securities Administrators Association issued a warning last week about summer scams, suggesting that investors protect themselves against ""hot energy-related tips, speculative real estate promotions, unsolicited invitations from new online 'friends,' and complex, opaque investment products that fail to offer clear disclosures of their risks and costs."" What the group failed to say but clearly implied is that the nauseating ride of the stock market and the flagging confidence of investors has made consumers more vulnerable to financial scams than at any time in memory While savvy investors like to think of scams as only luring in suckers and dupes Karen Tyler president of NASAA and the securities commissioner for North Dakota says that the evidence arriving at regulatory offices every day suggests otherwise It s not just suckers that are being taken in right now she says It seems that even people with a high degree of financial literacy can be convinced to do something right now that might otherwise defy logic or seem irrational It s just how people are reacting to the market The rapid run up in energy prices has brought back countless old ploys about oil and gas exploration and development as well as the always promising new technologies that pledge increased energy efficiency or the ability to get to resources once thought too expensive to harvest The financial predators and con criminals really mimic what is going on in the economy today borrowing from the headlines and crafting their scams based on the headlines and what is making the news to make things seem more legitimate Tyler said Let s face it high energy prices are something we are all thinking about today When the con criminal calls and pitches the net greatest thing coming out of the energy sector that will alleviate high oil prices and enhance production people are willing to listen She added It s easy to sell people on the idea that the demand for energy will keep going up and that they can cash in here doing much better than they can with their other investments Bubble trouble Likewise the real estate bubble and subprime lending crisis have brought new schemes about property related investments Even the emerging technology of the Internet is helping Tyler noted that NASAA members are concerned that rogues will use social networking ties and Web site community features to ingratiate themselves to like minded individuals then take advantage of that relationship Some networking sites make it easy for scam artists to post fraudulent investment ideas and many people are too trusting of their new online friends One reason the social network sites can become a problem in the current economic situation is that the chat boards and other interpersonal relationships can easily lead to a call to action Where that kind of push might seem forced in many settings it s not unusual for an online community to follow a few leaders reporting good results or rallying the troops for change Sidetracked goals The issue also stretches into the world of established legitimate investments that may be ill suited for some consumers One theme common to the investment advisory community these days is that brokers and financial planners have tools to help the investor reach their goals In many cases these can be complex equity indexed annuity products or variable annuity deals but not too long ago it was simply tilting a portfolio toward bonds through the use of auction rate securities All of these strategies can be appropriate but only in moderation and with the investor s complete understanding of what s at stake and how it works Tyler noted that for an investor who suffered big losses in auction rate securities bond issues that saw a calamitous price drop because they lost most or all of their bidders during the credit crunch knowing that the securities are legitimate is not much of a panacea The consumer can t necessarily access their money and the damage is real in terms of how it diminishes assets so while there is hope for a bounce back in the securities I don t think someone necessarily feels better about their loss because it came from a legitimate investment instead of a scam Tyler said Ultimately avoiding the scams and traps means approaching the situation rationally and dedicated to the process of acquiring full knowledge before buying an investment Part of the global issue of compromised confidence that we re seeing right now is that people feel like they have to make a change and do something different Tyler said There are so many significant challenges being faced by investors that indeed they are more vulnerable to acting on that desire to do something and be taken in Instead of making wholesale changes jumping to new advisers newfangled investment ideas or the next purported guru Tyler said investors should revisit the reasons why they made their investments in the first place It s not that making change is wrong it s more that they probably made those first choices carefully and want to be equally careful and maybe more careful before changing things now",0

You want to throw a holiday party but simply cannot afford to spend big bucks in the process. The holidays are full of expenses already without dropping hundreds or even thousands of dollars on festivities. Fortunately, there are plenty of ways to cut down on holiday party costs and still create a great atmosphere. Consider these suggestions to help you party on a budget. Invitations Keep the invitations as simple as the circumstances will allow What is appropriate depends on whom you are inviting If you are throwing an informal party make your own simple and whimsical paper invitations or simply save on paper and postage and go completely paperless If appropriate consider invitations via e mail or social media If paper invitations are a must consider alternatives such as a postcard that costs less to mail At the very least look for sales and clearances on fancier stationery Food Drinks Potluck is the simplest way to keep down costs Let everybody chip in on the food and drink bill by bringing his or her own dish You need a signup method or way to assign dishes so you don t end up with bowls of guacamole and no chips A signup also allows you to supply whatever is missing instead of providing backup for every contingency If potluck is not appropriate for the occasion there is no need to go overboard There are plenty of online resources to help you create your own relatively inexpensive appetizers without having to pay for expensive party trays or catering services Keep a relatively minimal selection of soft drinks or alcoholic beverages do not try to fit everybody s taste Themes can help to narrow the offerings naturally Going for an island theme Stick with tropical drinks Keep plenty of water and non alcoholic punch or juices on hand for younger guests and designated drivers Decorations With the clever use of a theme you can also keep your decoration expenses down Themes by definition allow simpler decorations as part of the overall ambiance Even without a theme there is nothing wrong with using as much of your available resources as possible before heading to the party supply store Simple candles and homemade centerpieces can create a nice effect without draining your cash Even mismatched items can be used to your advantage by creating a theme the red table vs the blue table or the fall table with pinecones vs the spring table with a simple flower arrangement Let your imagination loose to make the best of what you have before going out to supplement the d cor with extra purchases Coordinate your decorations with the food and drink plans For example it is more appropriate to use paper plates with a series of appetizers or potluck dining than it would be with a more traditional main course and side dishes Entertainment If you plan to have entertainment beyond your Uncle Fred singing his favorite classic rock songs after he has had a few too many and we suggest that you do consider some inexpensive options to a band or a professional DJ Technology allows you easily to be your own DJ in an unobtrusive way Thanks to smartphone apps like Pandora or iHeartRadio you can program your own channel that matches the tastes of your guests and set up a long enough playlist to get through the evening and perhaps have it cut off just in time to get rid of that last guest who simply will not take a hint You can set up the same thing on your computer if that is a more efficient way of handling the music Depending on the crowd do not underestimate the power of simple party games like Pictionary or even old fashioned charades Again be sure to assess your guest list to avoid breaking out anything inappropriate for the room Not everyone is up for holiday Twister With some advance planning you can have a great holiday party that everyone will be talking about for years to come and not because of frequent visits by the police or Uncle Fred s stirring rendition of Aerosmith hits Dream On indeed If you want more credit check out our list of credit card offers Photo iStockphoto com Dangubic Originally Posted at https www moneytips com tips for holiday parties on a budget Tips to Budget Holiday Spending Act Now to Save on Holiday Gifts Holiday Shopping Tips",0

"Dagens Industri, 18 Apr 2008, p.11:-

The moves by companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP) and Total SA (TOT) follow the lead of mining giant Anglo American PLC (U.AGL), which lowered mortality rates by distributing AIDS drugslast year.   We concluded that as well as being morally right it was a fundamental business requirement and cost effective BP spokesman Keith Bryer said A BP feasibility study showed the costs of missed work days and replacing ill and dying workers were greater than paying for treatment The U N estimates million Africans have AIDS An improvement in the standard treatment of the disease could have widespread implications for sufferers and the costs companies accrue for treatment Some healthcare activists also say they will begin a campaign for better AIDS treatment for oil workers in Africa A similar effort was launched against Coca Cola Co s Africa bottling plants last year Oil is politically hot right now says Sharonann Lynch of Health GAP a U S non profit group pushing for better access to AIDS treatments They want medications to be extended to subcontractors and franchise employees The number of Africans in the oil sector is small compared with mining but oil is a high profile industry that dominates economies like Nigeria and Angola Shell and ExxonMobil have more than workers in Africa combined but it s hard to assess the extent of HIV AIDS among their workers because the incidence of the disease varies by region In Angola one of the fastest growing areas of investment by oil companies reliable figures aren t even available because of a long civil war In Nigeria the rate of infection is as low as But in parts of Botswana where there are large oil refinery and retail operations the infection rate is as high as Oil companies even as they look at new ways to respond to the epidemic warn that treatment is difficult and risky in areas where medication can t be sustained by a local health care system Antiretroviral have to be carefully administered because of their potent side effects Shell is testing ways to standardize guidelines already in place in South Africa Nigeria Gabon Kenya and Ivory Coast for use throughout Africa The company has a big retail network in South Africa the AIDS epidemic is sometimes greatest in this part of the business An industry insider said AIDS came to the attention of Shell executives when gas station attendants died in one year Shell denies that figure ChevronTexaco will start distributing antiretrovirals in Angola where it has large offshore rigs by the end of the year Some companies reject the suggestion that these measures are being instigated by activist pressure They say the latest measures are part of a policy to deal with HIV AIDS in their workforce globally They also say most sophisticated AIDS activists know the epidemic in Africa requires more than just pressure on companies National healthcare networks need to be rebuilt and government priorities must be refocussed they say People way underestimate the complexity of giving out antiretrovirals Gray Kreiger a private health consultant who worked on the World Bank financed Chad Cameroon pipeline There are problems with importation equipment and lab testing In Chad we had trouble getting microscopes out of customs If you re in a country where you can t get a TB culture tuberculosis is the leading cause of death in AIDS patients then you have real problems no matter what drugs you have he added Some companies have decided distributing antiretrovirals when they can t guarantee adequate follow up treatment does more harm than good ExxonMobil for example prefers to link employees to local and non government organization programs and is focusing on prevention and education Treating HIV AIDS is not an ExxonMobil business core competency but this fact in no way lessens ExxonMobil s concern for the issues presented by HIV AIDS company spokeswoman Sandra Duhe said The cost of antiretrovirals a cutting edge drug available in some countries as a generic range from as little as to a month per person for companies depending on local laws and conditions Costs will rise as more workers contract HIV AIDS and sign up for the free medications BP estimates employees and their dependents or of its sub Saharan workforce have AIDS Not all companies cover subcontractors or workers in franchise operations such as gas stations Activists want the programs extended to cover these groups Health GAP says it will pressure the U S divisions of Shell BP and Total as well as ExxonMobil ChevronTexaco ConocoPhillips COP Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY Marathon Oil Corp MRO Arco and Unocal Corp UCL The Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility which represents faith based institutional investors controlling billion in assets plans to file resolutions with ChevronTexaco and ExxonMobil urging them to offer better treatment at the upcoming shareholders meetings Details of the resolutions haven t been worked out ICCR filed a similar resolution last year with ExxonMobil which was defeated By Shai Oster Dow Jones Newswires shai oster dowjones com",0

San Antonio-based USAA attracted the attention of transportation
experts nationwide earlier this year when it announced plans for Choice

exchange for a 90% discount on auto insurance. Seniors pay about $1,000
in advance for every 30 round trips in a USAA-provided limo; to receive
the discount, they must agree to drive only in emergencies.

 The three month old program was intended to give USAA s elderly members a transportation alternative as their driving skills deteriorated USAA officials had hoped to sign up several hundred seniors by now in the Orlando area Instead their fleet of Lincoln Town Cars is providing rides for just households or about USAA policyholders We expected to have more based on the enthusiasm early on says Janice Marshall president of USAA Alliance Services Co and architect of Choice Ride She says the insurer has fielded plenty of calls from interested seniors but as experts had warned few are willing to actually give up their car keys and in a way give in to old age They tell us they want it to be successful so it s there when they need it Ms Marshall says But they are not ready to sign up yet In fact the reluctance to give up any driving privileges has been so strong only two of the households have opted for the insurance discount and pledged not to drive The rest are simply paying for the limo service USAA officials are considering inviting seniors to a meeting where Ms Marshall says Choice Ride subscribers could share their stories of newfound freedom in going out to dinner at night or venturing out in bad weather USAA wants to give the Orlando trial run another year before deciding on expansion plans in other cities I am hoping we have put this in the back of their mind Ms Marshall says This is a yearlong decision",0

You might be just getting started with your first card, but review these five tips and you'll reap the benefits well after graduation day.

1. Five major factors affect your credit scores Several companies produce credit scores and most consider five factors your payment history credit utilization the length of your credit history the types of credit accounts you hold and any new credit accounts you ve opened No matter how long you ve had credit you can use each factor to get yours in good shape Payment history Paying all of your bills on time is the most important thing you can do for your credit even if you re only able to make the minimum payment If you accidentally miss a due date send the money as soon as you can You might incur a late fee but if you made the payment within days it won t be reported to the credit bureaus Credit utilization Utilization is the percentage of your available credit you re using Keep it low ideally below So if you have a credit card with a limit try to keep your balance below Your issuer might report your balance in the middle of the month so aim to have less than utilization at all times not just after you make your monthly payment Length of credit history The older the average age of your accounts the better so don t close your first credit card account when you open a second Instead use the first card occasionally to keep it active Types of accounts It helps to have a mix of credit accounts credit cards student loans an auto loan and so on But if you have only a credit card and don t need another account don t open it This factor is less important than the first three New credit Apply for new credit cards sparingly Each new account shortens the average age of your accounts and each new application results in a hard inquiry on your credit report which can ding your credit score The shorter your credit history the more this can hurt your credit so it s especially important to limit your applications when you re just starting out Bad credit hits more than just your wallet Having bad credit can increase the interest rates you pay and even your car insurance premiums But that s not its only impact Landlords and wireless providers commonly check applicants credit to find out whether they re likely to pay on time and having bad scores can limit your options for apartments and cell phone service If you re on your parents cellular plan and live on campus you might think this doesn t apply to you but it will soon Employers may also run credit checks and having bad credit could keep you from getting a job in some states Try not to carry a balance A NerdWallet survey found that of Americans think carrying a small balance on a credit card from month to month will improve their credit But you won t get a boost from maintaining a balance and it will definitely cost you in interest charges Use your credit cards enough to keep the accounts active but pay each balance in full every month to avoid interest Check your three credit reports annually Three major credit bureaus produce credit reports Experian Equifax and TransUnion You re entitled to one free copy of your report from each bureau every year via AnnualCreditReport com Review each for errors to keep your credit on track You won t find your credit scores on any of the reports You can find yours for free online at some websites including NerdWallet or perhaps through your credit card issuer If yours doesn t provide it you can buy it directly from Equifax Experian or TransUnion Scores may vary slightly depending on the scoring model used but they should all be in the same ballpark Build credit with a secured credit card To get a secured card you put down a cash deposit usually equal to your credit limit Banks can seize this if you don t make your payments so they ll issue these cards even to people who have poor credit or lack a credit history You ll get the deposit back when you close your account in good standing or upgrade your account to a regular unsecured card Secured cards make up less than of the credit card market but they re great for building credit A secured card works just like an unsecured card with the exception of the deposit You use it to make purchases then pay them off and your issuer reports your payment activity to the credit bureaus More credit lessons for students from NerdWallet How to read your credit reports Student credit cards Really for students How secured credit cards work Erin El Issa is a writer at NerdWallet Email erin nerdwallet com Twitter Erin El Issa The article Back to College Lessons on Building Credit originally appeared on NerdWallet",0

Press Release: S&PGR Afrms Rtgs On 4 Cls From 4 PHEAA Student Loan Trst Deals","13 Jan 2021 14:14 ET 
Press Release: S&PGR Afrms Rtgs On 4 Cls From 4 PHEAA Student Loan Trst Deals The following is a press release from S P Global Ratings OVERVIEW We reviewed four PHEAA Student Loan Trust transactions issued in and We affirmed our ratings on four classes of notes from the four transactions The affirmations reflect our view of the transactions credit enhancement levels collateral profiles available liquidity and payment structures as well as our view that each transaction has sufficient liquidity to cover interest payments to the notes over the next several months despite the impact of the COVID pandemic NEW YORK S P Global Ratings Jan S P Global Ratings today affirmed its AA sf ratings on the class A notes from PHEAA Student Loan Trust and Each transaction is backed by a pool of student loans originated through the U S Department of Education s ED Federal Family Education Loan Program FFELP Our review considered the transactions collateral performance available liquidity changes in credit enhancement and capital and payment structures We also considered the evolving macroeconomic environment that has resulted from the COVID pandemic which will likely present employment challenges for student loan borrowers Additionally we considered secondary credit factors such as credit stability peer comparisons and issuer specific analyses As vaccine rollouts in several countries continue S P Global Ratings believes there remains a high degree of uncertainty about the evolution of the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects Widespread immunization which certain countries might achieve by midyear will help pave the way for a return to more normal levels of social and economic activity We use this assumption about vaccine timing in assessing the economic and credit implications associated with the pandemic see our research at www spglobal com ratings As the situation evolves we will update our assumptions and estimates accordingly COVID IMPACT ON FFELP PORTFOLIO Although the levels of default for the loans in FFELP transactions may increase due to the COVID pandemic we expect the loans to maintain their guarantee from ED and for net losses to remain low S P Global Ratings affirmed its rating on the U S sovereign at AA Stable A on April Generally all of the borrowers loan payments interest and principal and the amounts received from ED are made available each period for the transactions waterfalls Typically FFELP transactions waterfalls first pay senior fees and expenses and then pay bond interest payments After bond interest payments are made the remaining available amounts are primarily used to make bond principal payments and in the case of certain transactions to make releases Effectively bond principal payments and releases are excess liquidity that is available if needed for bond interest payments in the short term A review of recent servicer reports for all of the transactions in our FFELP portfolio shows that generally bond interest payments make up no more than and on average of the total payments to bondholders As a result of the COVID pandemic we believe that FFELP transactions will be affected by higher levels of forbearance and income driven repayment relief Generally we believe FFELP transactions could withstand such temporary material declines in borrower payment levels and still make full and timely note interest payments We expect the decline in borrower payment levels will have a greater impact on the ability to repay principal by the legal final maturity date Classes with less time to maturity will be negatively affected to a greater degree than those with more time to maturity RATINGS RATIONALE We rely on the long term sovereign rating on the U S government AA in our analysis of defaulted loan reimbursements under the federally reinsured guarantee as well as ED interest subsidies and special allowance payments on the FFELP loans When the U S sovereign rating is AA our criteria require that for notes rated higher than the U S i e AAA rated notes payments backed by the U S government receive a haircut Based on our review of similar transactions backed by FFELP loans we generally believe a parity for releasing structures is commensurate with a AAA rating The class A notes parity ratio for each of the four PHEAA transactions is below Therefore we affirmed our ratings on these notes at AA sf Generally we calculate parity as the sum of the pool balance as of the end of the collection period and the reserve account over the relevant note balance as of the end of the distribution date CURRENT CAPITAL STRUCTURE All of the transactions in this review comprise one senior and one subordinate class with coupons based on a spread above a LIBOR index The subordinate classes are not rated PAYMENT STRUCTURE AND CREDIT ENHANCEMENT These transactions utilize a payment mechanism that defines a principal distribution amount to be distributed to the noteholders to achieve an overcollateralization target Generally once the overcollateralization target is reached available funds can be used to pay subordinated payments and then released out of the trust The target overcollateralization is non amortizing and thus provides a floor amount of credit support to the notes which is especially important during the transaction s later stages As a result overcollateralization should build and senior and total parity should grow as the loan pool amortizes Credit enhancement includes overcollateralization parity subordination for the senior classes the reserve account and excess spread COLLATERAL These transactions primarily comprise Stafford Consolidation and Parent Loan for Undergraduate Student loans that are supported by a guarantee from ED of at least of a defaulted loan s principal and interest Loans that have been serviced according to the FFELP guidelines are supported by this guarantee therefore net losses are expected to be minimal LIQUIDITY Based on the historical principal paydown of the notes and the expected impact of higher forbearance and IBR levels due to the COVID pandemic we expect that these notes will be repaid before their respective legal final maturity dates In our analysis a principal payment haircut is used to determine if the note is sensitive to the pace of principal payments This haircut illustrates the immediate potential percentage decrease in principal payments that would still result in full principal repayments by the legal final maturity date The notes in the transactions reviewed have haircuts above based on historical average principal payments over the past year We will continue to monitor the performance of the student loan receivables backing the transactions relative to our ratings and the available credit enhancement and liquidity for the notes RELATED CRITERIA Criteria Structured Finance General Global Framework For Payment Structure And Cash Flow Analysis Of Structured Finance

In Sterling s case his alleged girlfriend taped a phone conversation between them without his knowledge While the recording was used by the NBA in rendering the lifetime ban could the recording be used for evidentiary purposes in a legal proceeding While I cannot speak in detail about California law it is a two party consent state In other words every person who participates in the discussion must agree to be taped in order for it to have legally occurred How about in New Jersey Well New Jersey is a whole different story Known as a one party consent state only one person involved in the discussion needs to consent to the recording being made In other words only the person who is doing the actual recording needs to be okay with it which essentially goes without saying As a result many of our cases involve litigants who recorded the other party without that party s knowledge saying something that can potentially be used as evidence in the divorce proceeding Perhaps the recording revealed that the other spouse is working despite claims that she is a stay at home mother without any income or perhaps it reveals that she hid assets after having claimed full disclosure on her Case Information Statement From a custody and parenting time standpoint perhaps the recording reveals that he is still drinking excessively despite claims that he never drinks at all or finished his rehab program to completion or he admits to striking the child despite answering otherwise in his answers to interrogatories or when testifying during a deposition Like with the perils of social media the possibilities of what may show up on a recording are truly endless Depending on a given set of facts and circumstances it may be advisable for a party to procure a recording device and use it when speaking with the other litigant For one thing it could prove to be very useful should the other spouse ever make a false claim of domestic violence A recording of what truly transpired can be extremely valuable whether the allegations are true or not In other instances you never know what the other party may say that could be useful on any issue including those I list above On the other hand if the recorder is used in a certain way perhaps left in the other party s bedroom recording for days on end it could potentially constitute a form of domestic violence in and of itself should the other spouse discover the device Thus there are risks depending on how the recording is made If you are not recording the other party always be aware that you may be recorded Everything you say and everything you do may be on tape and may eventually be used against you in your divorce post divorce or custody proceeding Ultimately the Sterling recording led to the ban The fact that the recording was of a private phone conversation shows just how damning the content thereof could potentially be Family law litigants in New Jersey which requires the consent of only one party to make such a recording should be cognizant of both sides of the coin when conducting themselves with the other party The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances Mr Robert Epstein Fox Rothschild LLP Market Street th Floor Philadelphia PA UNITED STATES Tel Fax E mail communications foxrothschild com URL www foxrothschild com Click Here for related articles c Mondaq Ltd Tel http www mondaq com",0

Property experts are tipping that prices will rise another 5 per cent or 6 per cent during 2022. However the market might then crack under the weight of higher interest rates with some market watchers predicting a price slump of between per cent and per cent during The likelihood of higher official interest rates and tightening of lending rules by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority plus affordability constraints will dampen prices they say Shane Oliver chief economist at AMP Capital expects interest rates to start rising by the end of with property prices nonetheless to rise by about per cent nationally next year Sydney and Melbourne prices are forecast to rise by a similar amount CoreLogic figures show Sydney property prices soared per cent and per cent in Melbourne in the year ended October Dr Oliver says as affordability constraints are stronger in Sydney the southern capital s price growth could outpace Sydney next year He is not expecting the Reserve Bank of Australia to be too aggressive in lifting the cash interest rate as the economy picks up steam because of the high debt levels of households The central bank could raise rates twice towards the end of next year as inflation picks up perhaps an initial hike of percentage points from the current cash rate of per cent quickly followed by a second rise of to take the rate to per cent Dr Oliver says We could see another couple of hikes in taking the cash rate to per cent and that could be the end of it the RBA s rate rising cycle he suggests RateCity has calculated what it would mean for home owners if a percentage point increase in the cash rate flows through to variable interest rate mortgages The comparison website says a home owner with an mortgage over years would see their repayments increase by more than per cent to a month The figure is calculated assuming the new customer average variable mortgage rate of per cent is increased percentage points to per cent ANZ economists are pencilling in a rise in capital city house prices of more than per cent next year They expect Sydney prices to climb just over per cent with prices in Melbourne doing even better with a gain of about per cent The bank s economists do not expect official interest rates to increase until the first half of Andrew Wilson chief economist at MyHousingMarket is also forecasting prices in Sydney to rise by more than per cent during with Melbourne prices doing even better He says the southern capital s prices would likely do some catching up as it was the housing market most affected by lockdowns and affordability is better in Melbourne that in Sydney Angie Zigomanis director of Charter Keck Cramer s research and strategy team says prices could rise or per cent nationally next year However he says there is a chance that Melbourne s prices may not rise as much as in Sydney as the southern capital has been hit harder by a fall in both immigration flows and interstate migration There are questions as to how quickly those come back he says As to what is in store for prices beyond AMP s Oliver is expecting some price relief for patient buyers waiting to get a foot on the property ladder He is tipping price falls in Sydney and Melbourne of between per cent and per during as higher interest rates restrict the borrowing capacity of buyers ANZ economists say Sydney prices could be per cent lower during with Melbourne prices down per cent MyHousingMarket s Wilson is more bullish He says property prices in both cities could still rise by about per cent during because of a revival of the economy to pre COVID levels plus a return to strong migration that would refuel demand for property",0
"Let's combine two investor themes this week: One, investors love small cap stocks, and two, investors sometimes believe they 'missed'some large-cap growth winners. What if there was a way to follow the growth of a large successful company and make tons of money in a similar small cap stock? There is: With Baby Brother Stock Picks.

The idea is to find a big winner in the market, which (due to its success) is generally a very large company. Then, one looks for a much smaller company within the same industry. The 'baby brother'might be growing fast too, or, it might even become an acquisition target of the larger company.","Let's combine two investor themes this week: One, investors love small cap stocks, and two, investors sometimes believe they 'missed'some large-cap growth winners.

Do I need more exposure to stocks - or less? How worried should I be about the euro? But there's a major question often hiding in plain sight, one so fundamental to people's financial health many don't even think to ask it: Is my 401(k) plan any good? Certainly few of us need to ask whether the plans matter Americans now hold trillion in k s and similar defined contribution plans nearly three times as much as the trillion parked in annuities The plans weren t originally designed to be the nation s primary retirement lifeline they started as a minor tax perk for senior executives but they ve grown inexorably as ever more big companies have abandoned traditional pensions Only about a third of the corporate workforce can look forward to a monthly pension check today down from three decades ago Over the same period assets in k like plans have grown fold And yet as many economists and money pros know and as more employees are beginning to realize k plans are riddled with problems capable of tripping up even the most diligent investors The laundry list of pitfalls includes high and often hidden expenses as well as company provided advice that critics say ranges from vague to nonexistent And perhaps most frustrating many employees have little say over the investment options in the plan lineup meaning that picking the components of their k may be the biggest financial decision they never get to make For many investors the answer has been to adopt what amounts to a k plus strategy They re opening up separate accounts where they get investment options that their plans lack and seeking advice from outside financial planners As Seattle planner Lowell Lombardini Parker puts it Use what you can But if you have to go outside the k Expanding Your Choices During the financial crisis of many Main Street investors began searching for the first time for commodities foreign bonds and other alternative investments that could stay afloat when U S stocks sank But if they went looking in their k s advisers say chances are they found nothing and even now many plans haven t adapted Excluding target date products the average plan has just funds only one more than before the market crash according to human resources consultants Aon Hewitt The very categories the plans are missing are often the ones that employees could use to hedge their portfolios against a choppy stock market Less than half of plans have a bond index fund for example and only about one in four includes real estate funds The upshot is that some employees have decided in a sense to take the money and run setting up separate retirement accounts that can fill the holes in their k s The plan at aircraft giant Boeing for example has many things going for it including low fees and plenty of low cost index funds But it lacks some funds that focus on assets that can thrive in rocky markets including real estate investment trusts and Treasury inflation protected securities In response to this shortage many Boeing employees have built their own shadow k s Mr Lombardini Parker says he has dealt with dozens of clients from the company helping them buy low cost funds targeting those asset classes Boeing says its own plan includes a prudent menu designed to avoid overwhelming unsophisticated investors The shadow k strategy isn t necessarily the right fit for everyone Because a matching contribution from an employer is essentially free money planners say investors should always collect fully on that And higherincome workers may not be able to make tax deductible contributions to outside accounts if they also have a k Investors frustrated with their plans can also always approach the boss Retirement consultants say employers no less befuddled by the system are often happy to hear employee requests about say adding funds to a plan Bring In Reinforcements At about of k plans employees have access to investment advice But according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America a trade group only about one in five eligible investors takes advantage of the offer Why so little interest David Wray president of the plan council says the threat of lawsuits means large companies need to make sure investors in similar life situations get consistent recommendations which means the advice is less likely to be personalized Employers also almost always avoid offering advice about any assets that aren t in the k like a home or a spouse s savings The result Plan provided advice tends to be generic says Mr Wray The problem is that advice that isn t generic can get expensive Financial advisers can spend hours poring over every investment choice But their fees often start at of an investor s assets One Goldilocks option Some financial planners will counsel investors on a onetime basis for an hourly fee Brian Terry a Charlotte N C based adviser has seen dozens of k clients He gives his clients a rundown of their plan taking a few hours to help them pick investments many but not all return once a year for a follow up His price an hour Financial planners can have their own idiosyncrasies and agendas of course and if planners offer advice about investments outside the k investors should ask whether they get compensated for recommending any particular products When it s time to talk k preparation counts Think carefully about when you want to retire and how much money you hope to spend says Lea Ann Knight a planner from Bedford Mass who meets with many clients for similar consultations And don t be shy about secret ambitions like that condo in Maui Devote your face time with the planner to these goals says Ms Knight

Thanks for taking my call RAMSEY Sure CALLER Really appreciate some wise counsel RAMSEY Well give it a shot What s up CALLER A lot And I ll try to be brief A former widow married a man had medical malpractice suit from my deceased husband Put it in some annuities some IRAs The children got theirs Long story short the marriage is not going well We re currently separated I paid off his charges three or four times paid all the taxes estimated we re both in commission sales He came home two years ago and wanted another grand in charge cards that s in my name promising that this would be our future He s in real estate On a scale of to on stupidity or naivete Dave I don t know but I signed and I did it Okay So that is that part of it In the meantime had a daughter that was a drug addict used her funds to get her through rehab and on her own out of her annuities I did not use legal counsel I did it on my own So bottom line now is my daughter s hired an attorney to threaten me or to take me to court for the annuity money that I spent on her And my husband and I kicked out of the house back in April That switch that you talk about it flipped when he said he was going to come claim bankruptcy He wanted me to claim bankruptcy I said no this is my house in my name first and second mortgage And we kind of argued about it And a few days later a man came to shut off our heat So I called him in the office and said you are out I am tired of this stuff I ve invested in his business I ve done what I thought I should And I told him the money tree the giving tree and the loving tree is all gone Now what So I get to an attorney She said claim bankruptcy And I did RAMSEY The annuities are all drained CALLER I m sorry RAMSEY The annuities are all drained CALLER No what they did was they asked for the declaration page So that s where I am right now That was about five six weeks ago And the IRAs are going to be fine but the trustee asked for the declaration page to the annuities RAMSEY Uh huh CALLER So I m in a quagmire Not really sure RAMSEY So how much is in these annuity CALLER It pays out over years about grand a month starting in until death or years whatever RAMSEY Okay That money s gone All right are you making a living CALLER I m in commission sales I can do better You know I m going to have RAMSEY Can you make a living Can you eat CALLER Yeah I m doing OK I m doing all right I m selling RAMSEY Have you hired an attorney to sue your drug addict daughter back right CALLER No she s out and she s doing fine now RAMSEY No she s not Anybody that would sue their mother for getting them help is not doing fine by definition So I guess you know you re going to have to mount legal or just throw her threats of lawsuits and the bankruptcy I guess CALLER That s what the attorney did RAMSEY Okay CALLER So RAMSEY Any claims resulting from that would be CALLER Correct RAMSEY in the bankruptcy So that shuts her down Okay that works CALLER Yeah Well and I ve been excommunicated from the family No contact with them or any of my grandchildren RAMSEY Well of course CALLER Bit family It s just it s horrible RAMSEY Because you won t pay her back money that kept her from dying of drug addiction CALLER I ve got the receipts RAMSEY I know CALLER I ve given them the receipts but it s still you know it s family RAMSEY Okay so how can I best help you tonight CALLER I don t know which end is up I don t know what to do first I m going to l be in this house for a while The attorney said that you know you ve got six to nine months RAMSEY Yeah Basically rent free because you re not going to pay payments CALLER Right RAMSEY And it ll take them that long to take it Okay CALLER Right RAMSEY So well you ve got a pile of cash to start And we start with the basics We start with food shelter clothing transportation and utilities Any children at home CALLER No RAMSEY Okay CALLER One in college and the four others are out on their own RAMSEY Okay So it s pretty simple You just got to take care of you Food shelter clothing transportation and utilities And we take care of those things And from there then we rebuild CALLER I did the baby steps and I ve got in savings RAMSEY Good good And all the debts are in the bankruptcy So that s taken care of unless you ve got taxes or you have taxes outstanding CALLER Yeah that was part of the problem I paid the taxes for the first six years of our marriage And then it was his turn And he said he was And then he didn t So the IRS seized all my bank accounts at one time and left me one cent Aren t they nice One cent I mean RAMSEY Married filing jointly you know if you were not aware of what s going on it s a possibility you can qualify for innocent spouse provision You should ask a CPA about that But the only debts that ll survive bankruptcy would be typically something having to do with fraud which we don t have in this case Taxes would survive and child support those kinds student loans will survive a bankruptcy So if you ve got any of those things that s your baby step And then you move on to baby step number three which is build your emergency fund And you just begin to rebuild your life in the midst of all this emotion and drama that is your life right now And you know it s difficult thing to wade through that much stuff And you re wading through a bunch of it No question about it And you now if I were in your shoes if you were my little sister I would tell you to spend some time with a good counselor just because you ve been hit by people that you love so hard so many different ways that you ve got some pretty deep wounds That doesn t make you a bad person It just means you got hit You were in a car wreck emotionally And you know you got a broken leg a broken arm You got a head you know a cut on your head whatever Whatever metaphor you want to use for this And it d just be very wise for you to spend some time unpacking all of these things that have happened and you know picking up what your part of it is and laying down the rest of it and getting some peace about it and some forgiveness and moving on And you know there s a lot of stuff flying around in your life there that is obvious in just talking to you And it s not a bad thing I just would say it s a good thing to unpack that and you know reach some spiritual conclusions some emotional conclusions about some of this so you can put a bow on it move to the next stage of your life You ve had a lot of different things happen to you Thanks for the call All right Jennifer is next in Columbus Ohio Hi Jennifer welcome to The Dave Ramsey Show CALLER Hello Dave It s an honor to talk to you sir RAMSEY You too What s up CALLER Well just feeling a little stuck between a couple issues and looking for some advice on getting together a game plan RAMSEY Okay CALLER In summary I m the youngest of four kids My father has passed away and so did my oldest sister Most of the family responsibilities have come down to me The other two siblings just aren t really involved at for varying reasons I m trying to advise my mother financially And I m really not sure what the best options are for her at this point I ve been doing this for a few years now And now I m just kind of feeling a little stuck RAMSEY Is she following your advice CALLER She asks me and then does whatever she wants LAUGHTER RAMSEY That sounds normal Okay CALLER She s only in her early s And her family tends to live a long time eighties nineties hundred So even though she s in her s I m still thinking about her future RAMSEY That s a good thing CALLER And I just don t think she s making very good decisions She s wasting a lot of money I m trying to secure things But on the other hand I can t I don t want to insult here And I don t want to feel like I m taking over and she has no choice in her life RAMSEY Okay CALLER Her big thing is she does not want money to be tied up and inaccessible to her RAMSEY Okay CALLER I would love it to be RAMSEY Okay CALLER You know RAMSEY Because why What does she do with it that s irresponsible CALLER Mostly gambling RAMSEY Oh OK CALLER Or just RAMSEY And so how much money does she have CALLER Well I m not absolutely positive anymore RAMSEY Roughly CALLER I would guess about left RAMSEY To her name CALLER Yes RAMSEY Oh CALLER The house is paid off RAMSEY Yeah this is a broke person that doesn t need gambling in their life at all Okay CALLER I agree RAMSEY Wow CALLER I agree RAMSEY Well here s the deal I mean CALLER I ve been trying RAMSEY you know the first thing you got to establish is obviously she can t do that Obviously you there s not a legal mechanism that allows you to make her be smart unless you have her declared mentally incompetent And she s not mentally incompetent CALLER No not at all RAMSEY So you couldn t have her have that happen And so gambling s not illegal It s stupid but it s not illegal And you know lots of broke people do it And they re going to continue to be broke people And you know it s going to come down to you re probably going to end up having to pay her groceries because she gambles this money away And but before you know before you give her any money ever you re going to be then you have the right to say with this money comes strings You re not allowed to do this anymore You re not going to do any of this with this money And you know I really wouldn t give her any money if she s gambling at years old CALLER No RAMSEY I would just buy things like groceries or pay her light bill or whatever If you ve got the ability CALLER She s doing OK with living expenses It s just the savings that I m concerned with RAMSEY She has no money though CALLER Not really no RAMSEY I mean what is she living off of Social Insecurity CALLER Social Security and pension RAMSEY Yeah how big is her pension CALLER I think combined she brings in about a month RAMSEY Between the two Yeah So she can eat on that with a paid for house and then gamble away the other and still survive CALLER Right RAMSEY You know but you know there s not really a lot you can do to make somebody that you love that s misbehaving suddenly behave All you can do is just be there And you know if they ask you can say But as you said was classic you know I tell her what I think she should do then she goes and does what she wants to do And you know folks are just that way Adults are that way They have the legal right to go do stupid things Stupid s not yet illegal Thank goodness we d all be in jail for something we ve at some time or another in our lives So I think it s just you know you re the only one that cares And you re having to watch someone that you love hurt themselves And that s a hard thing to do And I think I would just say that out loud and then step back and smile and love her and watch it We ll be right back with more of your calls The phone number s This is The Dave Ramsey Show on the FOX Business Network COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CALLER Hi Dave My name is Ahmed I was going to ask you what s the best way to teach my kids about investing END VIDEO CLIP RAMSEY Great question Well it depends on the age of course Once they can do basic multiplication and grasp the idea where could look at share price and a mutual fund versus times the number of shares that you own equals the total dollar value in there and then you can begin to you know share with them what their mutual fund looks like if you ve got a mutual fund For instance our kids we had college funds in their mutual funds And so they could watch their college fund And then when we you know there d be something on the TV that night or the television of the stock market going up or down then we d sit down and look at that and maybe go online and look say this is what happened to the mutual fund But we don t worry about that We ride it out up or down We have a long term perspective That s the definition of investing And you don t want to do a bunch of stuff where like they play with single stocks because then that teaches them to buy and sell single stocks which is a bad idea The track record of people who mess around with that is not very good Most people don t do very well doing that Everybody thinks they do They ve got that it s like phishing stories They ve all got that one that was a big catch but then they forget about all those days they went and caught nothing or they lost everything That kind of a thing So you know investing honestly is pretty boring because you just kind of buy and four get it Once you ve gotten a good mutual fund picked out But you can walk them through and show them some of the math things and create some teachable moments have some discussions And that ll help you to begin doing that But I wouldn t do anything too sophisticated too fancy because then that teaches them that this has to be complicated It s really not Okay let s go next to Frank Frank is in Winston Salem Hi Frank how are you tonight CALLER I m good How are you on this evening RAMSEY Better than I deserve sir How can I help CALLER I heard you on our local channel here in the morning You had a marriage counselor in there talking And I was tried to call in that day and couldn t get through So I called in this evening And me and my wife been having some problems for about well we ve been married for seven years And it s been going on seven years To make a long story short she s had two affairs And we ve got a child together that is six years old And I ve got two children from a previous marriage And she won t let me see them She s tried everything she can do to get them out of my life And I don t know what you do We split up and got back together and split up and got back together And she s fine for a month or so and then goes back to the same old not wanting my other kids RAMSEY So why does she not want them around CALLER The only thing I can figure is jealousy There s no I don t show any more attention to them than I do you know our daughter And I don t know She don t give me an honest reason She just says they re not my kids I don t want to them here RAMSEY Uh huh OK Well CALLER We ve been to marriage counselors We ve been we ve talked to a preacher RAMSEY And what do they say to her CALLER You know they re his kids You knew he had them before you all were married You know he needs to be a part of their lives you know just like he needs to be a part of you know our child s life RAMSEY Well Frank I m just a guy I m not a marriage counselor I ve been married years And so I don t have any you know great marriage counseling insight to give you I mean at some point she s going to have to decide that she values you and your marriage more than her jealousy of these kids because it is not reasonable for you to disown your children because this lady who obviously has emotional issues can t get her act together CALLER Right RAMSEY And so the only thing I know how tell you is sometimes you know you ve obviously said all you can say to her I don t have anything to tell you to say to her but sometimes the light comes on if you ll continue to be involved in the congregation You said preacher Be involved in your local church Some other ladies being around her some other friends being around here There s some modeling going on of people doing marriage right around you And maybe that rubs off on her some I know it s rubbed off on me some I ve watched guys that were better husbands teach me by their example to be a better husband you know And so that s a kind of thing that might help her And of course I think I would continue to invest in sitting down with some kind of a counselor whether it s your pastor preacher you know a professional marriage counselor any of that s fine with me But it s obvious that you guys are going to have to invest in that because you can t just sit where you are Where you are stinks You know she s being a jerk about the kids You re freaked out about that And this has got to stop And so it s not going to lead you to good places And you re not going to abandon your children You d be crazy to You d be the wrong kind of guy to do that So I think you got to continue to have input into your marriage and you re your relationship from other people And that s good friends and that church type of a setting And that s you know some good counsel And continue to do that And then you know maybe one of these days that information will get through And you ll see a change of heart for her I sure hope so We ll be right back with more of your e mails and calls Our phone number s You re watching The Dave Ramsey Show on the FOX Business Network COMMERCIAL BREAK RAMSEY Tonight s did you know percent of teens say they have never discussed using credit cards responsibly with their parents Well that s interesting Seven out of teens have not had a discussion about a credit card with their parents And yet it is the number one cause of bankruptcy among young adults So you parents are horrible That s your parenting I mean what is your deal using credit cards responsibly Maybe you could have a discussion like never use them That s a good way to never have one that s a good way to use them responsibly Kim is on the line Kim s in Salt Lake City Hi Kim welcome to The Dave Ramsey Show CALLER Hi Dave RAMSEY Hey what s up CALLER First of all thanks for taking my call RAMSEY Sure CALLER And I ve got some mortgage questions for you And I ll give you a little history I m a disabled widow I m waiting for an insurance policy to pay off and but that could be I don t know when RAMSEY A life insurance or disability policy CALLER Life insurance policy RAMSEY When did your husband pass CALLER He passed November S it s been we ve been fighting the battle RAMSEY Why are they not paying out on it CALLER They re saying that it was due to drugs and alcohol And it was a classic pulmonary embolism So I ve had to go to get an attorney and go to court on it RAMSEY Drugs and alcohol are not a reason not to pay out on a typical life insurance policy What kind of a policy was this CALLER I was accidental death policy RAMSEY Oh Okay CALLER That s why RAMSEY Okay CALLER But my biggest question is I m four months behind on my mortgage I ve been working with the mitigation department And I ve found people have been calling me telling me that I can restructure my loan And I m under the understanding that restructure his they don t mess with the time of the loan They renegotiate the interest rate of the loan And then they put all the RAMSEY Who is calling you I m sorry who s calling you your mortgage company CALLER No I put I tried to file some stuff with the mitigation department online And I guess I inadvertently got on a Web site so I ve had like five or six different companies call me RAMSEY Oh you stay completely away from CALLER About his restructure RAMSEY You stay completely away from those people It s a total scam CALLER And I m well what I m having a hard time finding somebody to help me restructure this loan without them charging me to RAMSEY They re going to charge you to And they re going do nothing CALLER Right RAMSEY Don t do any of that ever The only person that can restructure your loan is your mortgage company Are you talking to them CALLER I have been And but it is really hard to get ahold of them And I m really worried about them sending me a letter of foreclosure RAMSEY Well I think they re probably going to You re four months behind CALLER Right RAMSEY And so if you don t get it restructured so why are you behind CALLER I just ran out of funds RAMSEY Okay CALLER I ve used all of the money that you know RAMSEY So what do you make a year What is your disability income CALLER My disability I m getting a month RAMSEY Okay And how much other money do you have nothing else CALLER Not anymore I ve used all if the you know inheritance money for the home RAMSEY What s the home worth CALLER It s worth I owe on it And it s on a year at percent RAMSEY Okay You re not going to like my answer Let me tell you up front CALLER Okay RAMSEY But it s the best thing for you to do anyway If I woke up in your shoes I would not be waiting around on this life insurance policy to make your life OK because you may never get that money I hope you do but it might not come in time to save this house And you have to much equity in this house to lose it And the chances of them rewriting this loan to where you can pay the payment on a sign income is zero They do not have a program that s going to drop your payment to per month CALLER Right RAMSEY And that s what it s got to be or a month for you to live on a month right CALLER Right RAMSEY And so you can t afford this house darling CALLER Well I was looking at doing a quick sale And the bottom line is I d end up coming out with or RAMSEY Yeah I don t know that I have to do a quick sale I think I d get a realtor Get the thing on the market Try to get it sold in the next to days They re not going take the house in minutes CALLER Right RAMSEY If they start a foreclosure it will take them several months from now to do that You probably have two or three months minimum Maybe six months before the actual foreclosure sale occurs RAMSEY And so in most states it takes days or more from the time they actually named the date of the foreclosure sale and they re a long ways from doing that They will not do that until you are about six months behind on a traditional mortgage What s your interest rate CALLER RAMSEY Okay you re on traditional mortgage an FHI a VA or a Fannie Mae And they re not going to take you to foreclosure sooner than six months You re only four months behind So we ve got at least days to get this house sold Okay So I m going to put a sign in the yard this week And I m going to try to sell it And then you can walk out with a traditional sale you know with maybe here Right CALLER Right RAMSEY And then I m going to go buy a little inexpensive nice condo that s safe that you have zero payments on And then that will give you the ability to live off on per month Then if the insurance money comes in and how much money is that on that accidental death CALLER It s and then you know the lawyer s going to take a chunk RAMSEY Yeah Then I would take that balance that s not enough to make you move back INAUDIBLE I would take that money and invest it to have a little bit more income to go with your And of course depending on the nature of your disability if there s something that you can do to earn some other income that s going to be advisable too because a month s going to be tough to make it on for a lot of years And that s really what you re facing And so I would get this thing up for sale before it gets any further behind You can continue to work with them directly with your mortgage company to the extent they ll work with you about restructuring the loan but there s really not a restructure mathematically that is going to make mortgage fit in a per month income You know the thing is just RAMSEY Bad body said sad story And so I m going to go ahead and sell this house while I ve still have time to not have to give it away And come out of there with enough to buy you a little condo or something cash that you can be safe in and is paid for that you never lose that what Great question Sorry you re facing this darling All right more of your calls and e mails right after the break Send me your questions at Daveonair Daveramsey com This is The Dave Ramsey Show on the FOX Business Network COMMERCIAL BREAK BEGIN VIDEO CLIP CALLER Hi Dave My name is Rachel I have been with Citibank over years I just got a letter that they re going to raise my fees Do you think I should look for another bank or try to challenge them I didn t see any reason for doing it END VIDEO CLIP RAMSEY You know when do you reach the point I m mad as hell and I m not going to take it anymore I mean when do you reach that point with these banks They just mistreat and you just stay with them Why If you keep going to a restaurant for its lousy service how do you complain about the food You don t You leave them They re morons They mistreat their customers You re one of them I don t know why you re one of them Leave Go to a great little community bank who actually care that you re there Go to a credit union who will actually care that you re there And then if they raise the fees you can actually get to talk to a human who might discuss it with you You don t get a letter in the mail Oh my goodness See this is the deal People somehow feel I have been with them years Well years ago they were a different company Somewhere during that years they lost their soul You know You just can t You just can t stay and continue to do business with people who mistreat you This isn t hard to figure out Mark is on the line in Chicago Illinois Hey Mark Welcome to THE DAVE RAMSEY SHOW And how are you tonight CALLER Hey Dave Thanks for taking my call RAMSEY Sure CALLER I am doing good RAMSEY Good What s up CALLER A quick question to your point You know I have some extra cash I guess I m wondering is it wise to try to pay off my mortgage after a lot of different things as soon as possible Or is it better off to put that money toward some other resource You know my wife and I both work I think we make a good income for our age I really don t know how to judge it if it s good or bad RAMSEY What s your income CALLER I think combined we re about we re right at RAMSEY Mm hmm Well you re in the top one half of percent of Americans regardless of their age So that would be called pretty good LAUGHTER CALLER OK OK Like I said I m pretty modest I don t know how to judge it RAMSEY You re killing it dude That s how I m judging it So how much you have any debt except you house CALLER You know I have a small credit card debt not much A small student loan RAMSEY OK First thing I ll do is pay those two off CALLER OK RAMSEY I ll just clean up the house there You got a little mess Clean up the house get organized And then you need to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses In your place that s to CALLER Right Yes I mean I CROSSTALK RAMSEY They re just for emergencies Never to be touched CALLER Yes Right I probably got a bit RAMSEY OK CALLER You know I wouldn t say six months but I probably got four four and a half months RAMSEY OK Well you re in good shape then as long as you don t touch it CALLER No Right That s the do not touch fund RAMSEY Yes That s the operable thing This is not really an investment This is just in case of emergency In case Murphy knocks at the door and we can t answer the question Then the next thing I would do is make sure you re putting percent of your income into retirement Are you investing a year about a month CALLER Yes I hit the IRS limit on my k plan Annually RAMSEY All right And what about your wife CALLER My wife she puts the maximum that her company her organization lets her put RAMSEY Does that amount to a year total CALLER Um I don t believe so because RAMSEY I don t think so either CALLER Yes RAMSEY So you need to look at how you can do some investing to get you to a total of percent of your household income which would be about a year Do you have children CALLER Yes I have two small boys RAMSEY OK Do you have any college savings done CALLER Yes we have it s one of those can t think of a name It s not a some of those college funds those very INAUDIBLE fund that came out through RAMSEY s CALLER Yes through s RAMSEY Is it a prepaid college CALLER No it s not a prepaid college It s more like an annuity I believe I don t know if I m doing the right thing for that either RAMSEY I would have that in good mutual funds and let that be your college fund Annuities I m not real thrilled with just because of the extra fees And I wanted something that s gong to pay well so we re going to do retirement OK we re going to have no debt except the house We re going to have an emergency fund We re going to do retirement Do the kids college I m walking through what we call are the baby steps Mark and baby step number six is the next one after college and that s pay off the house early And then the answer is after I m doing these other things yes I would be paying off the house early as fast as I could because if you have a pay for a house would you go borrow on it in order to investing The answer is no CALLER Right RAMSEY And that s the same question I m just asking it backwards CALLER Exactly because that would be you know that was the other thing So how much I mean the boys are young They re years old How much should I be saving or trying to invest monthly for a college type of program that s not you know a month a month I you know or as much as I can RAMSEY Well to cover their undergrad in an in state college probably a month will take care of you pretty easily CALLER OK RAMSEY If you want to go fancier than in state college tuition and you want to do more than just undergrad then you re going to need to save more than a month each but that will take good care of you there You re right on track on that So I ll be doing that I ll make sure I had a year going into retirement and everything else I can squeeze out I m going to start throwing at the house and pay it off as fast as I possibly can then the last up is with the house paid off there s nothing left to do then but to become very wealthy and give a bunch of it away All right Question coming in on Twitter now After going through FPU I m committed to launching my photography business without debt Good But I m overwhelmed by all the start up costs Any suggestions Yes You only need to buy a camera Used And then after you have a couple of shoots with the camera and somebody pays you then you can buy a light and then once you shoot with that light and that camera and then you might buy another light Then once you shoot with that you might have another lens But you don t have to buy all of this stuff up front in order to be a photographer A photographer these days especially with digital the way it is has everything to do with your eye Look through the lens and see things I look at a lot of photographs We do a lot of print work a lot of things around here And I ll just tell you you can after you do that for a while I m not artist I m not a graphic artist but I can tell and looking at you know photographs who s got an eye that INAUDIB,0

It might feel more like Ã¢â‚¬Å“inebriation dayÃ¢â‚¬Â for some folk but, on a brighter note, it could prove truly intoxicating for investors.

Turning water into wine is a fundamental form of wealth creation Ã¢â‚¬â€ even the son of God is said to have tried his hand at it Ã¢â‚¬â€ and making beer or whisky are other ways of adding value. No wonder various kinds of bottled sunshine helped this shareholder to survive three months of dreary lockdown. For example Diageo the drinks giant whose brands include Guinness Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff is a long standing holding that went into my forever fund at per share in October The price briefly exceeded last year before a series of sobering announcements put a stop to the party including last Monday s postponement of publication of its preliminary results City cynics sagely warned that bad numbers take longer to add up and the share price went flat at so I bought some more on Thursday Even at that level my modest gain is being topped up by dividends running at and covered times by corporate earnings While dividends are not guaranteed and dozens have been cut or cancelled during the coronavirus crisis it is notable that Diageo has delivered a series of pay rises for shareholders Its dividends have increased by over the past five years Subject to the results now due on August this long term investor continues to regard the current fears as a short term setback for a great British business Diageo closed at on Friday Greene King the Suffolk brewer is another example of doing the double with income and growth from the wet trade I allocated my full Isa allowance at per share in April when the shares were yielding more than Various saloon bar bores were kind enough to write in to say that I was wasting my time and money But the billionaire Li Ka shing seems to have disagreed because he bought Greene King for bn last August when I sold my Isa stake at per share bagging a five figure tax free profit Funnily enough another pubs group in which I invested Fuller Smith Turner also attracted an agreed m bid for its London brewery in January last year that time from Asahi of Japan I remain a shareholder not least for a discount off all food and drink at Fullers fabulous pubs Similarly I retain a small stake in the Kentish vineyard Chapel Down where I would only get p for shares I bought at p but will shed no tears because of a discount off the price of its excellent sparkling wines One of the few positive things to say about the coronavirus crisis is that it reminds us to have fun while we can Heineken the giant Dutch brewer is the last of my squiffy shares but by no means the least I paid in January for shares that cost now Nor is alcohol the only way to gain from drink and a desire to socialise As I may have mentioned before I invested in the tonic maker Fever Tree Drinks at per share in March and sold half of them at in October to help to buy the cottage I am sitting in now It s not rocket science is it Buy what you know is as good a rule for DIY investors as any Without wishing to sound like an absolute lush it would be fair to say I have done quite a bit of bottoms up research into the drinks trade over the decades Next Saturday I intend to do more But fears of a second wave of coronavirus and a subsequent clampdown on social interaction remain the ghost at the booze stocks banquet Investors should beware of what the economist John Maynard Keynes called animal spirits which a former chairman of the American Federal Reserve or central bank translated as excessive exuberance Ahead of Independence Day we might recall that William McChesney Martin another Fed chairman defined his role as being to take the punch bowl away just as the party gets going Bear in mind that share prices have been boosted by historic low interest rates As pointed out here several times over the years there simply isn t a better hole to go to if you are seeking real returns Now I note that fewer financial experts are expressing amazement at rising share prices and more of them have begun to dub this bull market TINA standing for there is no alternative Ever the contrarian I would just point out that shares prices will probably slump when interest rates rise However there is no reason to expect that to happen soon So any tendency to worry about such a prospect should recall another of Keynes observations In the long run we are all dead On a happier note I remember a lunch long ago before which Fred Trueman the England and Yorkshire cricketer gave this grace Blessed Jesus Lord divine you turned the water into wine Now forgive us humble men as we turn it back again Let s hope this party doesn t end with a hangover It s time we stopped feeding the FCA fat cats More than years after financial services were subject to statutory regulation our sleepy City watchdog last week mused about doing something to cap fund managers pay but not before next year Like St Augustine the suits at the Financial Conduct Authority appear to be saying Make us good but not just yet Christopher Woolard interim chief executive of the FCA said A new UK regime would represent a significant improvement in the regulation of investment firms For the first time it would deliver a regime designed with investment firms in mind Individual investors may wonder when we will get a look in But it s no use asking Woolard because he is halfway out of the door and due to be replaced by Nikhil Rathi chief executive of the London Stock Exchange in October Do try to keep up Why should we care Because the FCA s annual budget of m is funded by the companies that it regulates which pass these costs on to consumers With regulators eating their way through more than m a week including an annual salary of plus pension for Rathi it all adds up The more of our money that slumbers in the regulators and fund managers wallets the less that will be left to work for us Take a walk around the Square Mile or Canary Wharf in London and ask yourself who paid for all those plate glass palaces You did Some fund managers more than justify their fees but many don t and are amply rewarded for failure DIY investment is not easy and will not suit everyone because there is no one else to blame when things go wrong But if more of us took more interest in our life savings we might get better value Either way it beats relying on the regulators Email ian cowie sunday times co uk and follow him on Twitter at iancowie Read a full list of Ian Cowie s forever fund thesundaytimes co uk cowieholdings thesundaytimes co uk

"CONCORD -- A plan to raise the statewide property tax rate, but exempt most primary residences, drew more than three hours of testimony and questions yesterday.

Members of the House education funding sub-committee closely questioned sponsor Rep. Michael Asselin, R-Danville, about his plan to keep the tax most other school funding plans drop. Asselin wants to raise the rate from now to per thousand of equalized value The tax would be paid on second homes and business properties To offset their higher business property tax rate Asselin proposes cutting the business enterprise tax by a third and the business profits tax from percent to percent We need tax relief This plan provides it Asselin told the panel He estimates the cuts will reduce current business tax receipts by million Gov John Lynch has said that any education funding plan he signs will have to eliminate the state property tax which he calls an accounting fiction because it is paid entirely at the local level Asselin said his plan keeps the tax in place because we need a stable source of revenue to funding education in the future Other taxes will not keep up You need a broadbased tax to do that he said Asselin said his plan is better than four others under consideration because it significantly increases the Education Trust Fund boosts education grants in all but communities gives all homeowners a tax cut and provides enhanced tax relief to low income homeowners While the committee appeared open to his idea there were also worries that the plan takes the state so far in a new direction that it might take too long to put into place Revenue Administration Commissioner Phil Blatsos said he thinks it would take months to train state and local officials set policies for collection and distribution Asselin wants the bill in effect on July Saying he has no problem with the concepts in the bill Blatsos added I m uncomfortable with the time frame Asselin said his plan is based on a per pupil cost of each The per pupil grant from the state would vary depending on the wealth of each community Those with the lowest value of property on a per pupil basis would get the highest levels of aid Those with the highest property values would get the least Berlin for example gets per pupil while Gilford gets The plan calls for all state property tax payments to go directly to the state then be disbursed to communities under the targeting formula Current law leaves most of the tax within the town raising it Critics say that any plan to eliminate the statewide property tax will force local property taxes higher Asselin said he d be willing to include a measure of local income in his aid formula The sub committee is working on several plans at the same time and will be in session today if weather permits The plan it eventually recommends will have to pass a number of steps including a trip to the House Finance Committee before it can move to the Senate The state is distributing million this year from sources other than the statewide property tax Asselin s plan would distribute million raised through the state property tax as well as taxes on business restaurants real estate and other sources The key difference is that most homeowners are exempt from the tax he said It exempts the first of a home s value from the tax but Asselin said he is willing to raise the exemption higher He also raises from million to million the funds available to help low and moderate income local property taxpayers The bill counts not only income but assets including stocks bonds and retirement accounts Asselin also leaves the current school funding law in place as a back up plan in case the New Hampshire Supreme Court should rule some part of his plan unconstitutional Blatsos said the plan is so different from other models that it is difficult to estimate how it would affect state revenues He said businesses based outside New Hampshire that do business here could see taxes go down depending on whether they own property in state Those that are based here could see a tax hike depending on their property holdings Rep Mary Cooney D Plymouth said the Asselin bill would solve the problem that sees low income families having to pay high taxes because local property values are low Fred Bramante a former chair of the state Board of Education said the plan works This is a plan that will make this a better state for its businesses and for its citizens he said",0

I never fully understand news events unless I know the history. I need to understand how we got here. So when George Osborne announced in his annual Budget statement a significant revision in how people access their pensions, with more details announced this week, and called it the biggest change in almost a century, I naturally had to find out what it was that happened so long ago. This took me to a place that few of us would expect to visit the Finance Act This does indeed turn out to have been an important piece of legislation For that was when full tax relief first became available on contributions made to pension schemes In other words it created a valuable incentive for saving up for one s old age It was a further step in a social revolution that had begun in when Lloyd George introduced a National Insurance scheme paid for by employees and employers alike which was in essence a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment Now I hasten to add that Osborne s pension reforms have left the system of full tax relief largely intact Employers will go on taking pension contributions from your pay before deducting tax but not National Insurance contributions But one can see that if the state was going to provide a subsidy of this size to encourage saving for retirement it must have seemed perfectly reasonable to force these savers as far as one reasonably could to use their pension pots to purchase an annuity the financial instrument that actually produces a regular income until death Otherwise there would be a strong likelihood that the state subvention would be wasted And it is this near compulsory annuitisation with its penal per cent tax penalty on spending one s pension pot as one pleases that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has swept away However the problem for which compulsory annuitisation was supposed to provide an answer remains How can the state be reasonably sure that subsidised savings for retirement are sensibly used when the moment comes In its way Osborne s answer may prove to be as significant and as long lasting as the pension clauses of the Finance Act For in his amplification of his Budget statement he repeated that guidance on pensions choices would be guaranteed and that it would be provided by independent organisations And in turn this would be funded by a levy on regulated financial services firms The Treasury also announced that an individual would have had to take advice from an impartial financial adviser regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority before a transfer could be accepted Thus compulsory annuitisation is being replaced by compulsory advice Compulsory advice This is a novel concept In the vast market for financial products there has been a glaring disparity between the power and strength of the suppliers banks insurance companies unit trust groups and the like and consumers Only wealthy consumers have been able to afford the level of advice they require if they are to make successful purchases For the pass was sold in the s and early s when the High Street banks began to sell their own financial products starting with unit trusts This meant that from then on it was no use asking your bank manager for advice He or she had a straight conflict of interest Not a moment too soon this lousy system has recently been partially dismantled Compared with all this Osborne s proposals appear excellent The same body that supervises the major suppliers of financial services would regulate the new advisory firms And the costs would be paid by the industry So far so good But there are a lot of details to be settled In particular it appears that face to face advice would be the exception rather than the rule More reliance would be placed on internet based advice and consultations by telephone This would be a pity For there is no substitute for a full and frank discussion face to face Given that Osborne would have equalled his distant predecessor at the Treasury Sir Robert Horne the architect of the Act But I cannot refrain from adding that when I sought some biographical details I discovered that Sir Robert was known as a womanising bachelor and was famously referred to by a future Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin as a Scots cad a whittamsmith independent co uk",0

By","California State University - Stanislaus; Turlock, CA - news

By As the spring semester comes to an end California State University Stanislaus Stan State students are trying to process the new California State University wide tuition increase that is planned to go into effect this upcoming fall The dollars increase is another expense that struggling students must overcome in order to gain a higher education Although resources such as the financial aid office are in place to help students with the transition students still have mixed emotions about the inevitable situation I feel like this is something that should be talked about more publicly in order to prepare students better for this increase As a college student money is hard to come by so having to pay extra will tighten my budget even more so Ruby Quiralte junior Kinesiology said Although an extra dollars out of pocket may seem like a lot compared to other CSU campuses Stan State still manages to be one of the least expensive This of course is including academic expenses with an estimate to living expenses That extra money could go to my rent or household items since I am from out of state Sierra Mariano freshman Liberal Studies said Financial stability may be a struggle with the increase in tuition but with grants waivers and financial aid the financial increase can be covered and for some students who pay out of pocket the increase has little to no effect on them I wouldn t mind paying an extra dollars for a needed upgrade however it is unfortunate the benefits coming out of it did not happen sooner Deenah San Luis senior Kinesiology said That brings up the question what do the students believe the money should be used for The campus may have one agenda but students may have another I think the money should go towards updating the classroom with technology That is highly beneficial to students especially at the college level Mariano stated Updating our campus would be nice making it more modern and friendlier with better social areas food courts and coffee shops Quiralte said Although those things would be a nice addition to the campus the increase has a specific plan on what to do with the money The tuition increase is primarily meant to help with graduation rates Students should look forward to an increase in professors classes and advisors This will not only create revenue for our school but increase student socialization and activity overall said Quiralte Distributed for UWIRE via M Communications www m com",0

Warner voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2009, calling it imperfect but necessary to undo insurance restrictions that kept many from getting health care. He pressed unsuccessfully in 2013 for a one-year delay in enforcing the health mandate. Proposed changes include: Establishing a low cost plan aimed at young adults who are required for the first time to buy health insurance The so called Copper Plan would have lower premiums but higher consumer cost sharing for medical care Insurers would have to provide the same minimum coverage required by the law Exempting companies that employ fewer than full time workers from having to provide voluntary health insurance plans for their employees Currently the exemption covers companies with fewer than full timers Increasing the number of companies that can qualify for health insurance tax credits Requiring state insurance regulators to design uniform rules so that policies can be sold across state lines The ACA legalized the practice but state officials worry about control of out of state providers Replacing new health insurance reporting requirements for small businesses with yet to be defined simpler methods Gillespie opposes the Affordable Care Act He proposed a replacement law that would abolish the requirement that most Americans buy health insurance and he would get rid of health care exchanges He proposes that the government provide tax credits for people without employer coverage to buy health insurance credits would increase with a consumer s age and family size His plan would no longer require insurers to cover a family s adult children until they are He also wants limits on malpractice awards to bring down insurance costs and discourage doctors from ordering extra medical tests His plan also would allow insurers to compete across state lines To encourage consumers to set up health savings accounts he proposes each person be eligible for a one time tax credit if they have an account He says his plan would cost just under trillion over years which he argues is less than half of the cost of the ACA Sarvis opposes the Affordable Care Act and favors deregulation of health care by Washington and the states He favors a national health care market with little state interference and would end tax breaks for employer based insurance He wants to lower the cost of medical care by greatly expanding both the number of medical professionals doctors physician assistants and nurses and their authority to treat patients He would allow them to practice across state lines without getting another state s license DEFENSE AND VETERANS Warner is a proponent of an carrier Navy He and others in the state s delegation successfully pushed this year to keep money in the budget for the multibillion dollar overhaul of the aircraft carrier George Washington at Newport News Shipbuilding He opposed plans to cut financial support for military commissaries and has said proposals to change military pay or benefits should wait until a commission studying the issue finishes in early He was active in successful efforts to block Navy plans to transfer a Norfolk based carrier to Mayport Fla He voted for recent Veterans Affairs reform legislation passed in response to a scandal involving falsified records and appointment delays It included his proposal to use free services of private Virginia high tech firms to help upgrade the agency s patient appointment systems and business operations He successfully pushed to expand a program to have law school students assist veterans in getting their VA benefits Gillespie favors increasing the size of the Navy from about ships to He says hundreds of billions in reductions to defense spending during the Obama administration should be reversed He says if the ACA is repealed it would save more than trillion which could be used for defense and other things He supports changes to Veterans Affairs to deal with lengthy appointment delays and opposes proposals by Obama to raise Tricare copays for military retirees and families of active duty service members to help cover rising medical costs He opposes a proposal to reduce the subsidy for commissaries Sarvis says Pentagon spending can be cut and incredibly expensive programs like the Air Force s F stealth fighter the F Joint Strike Fighter and the V Osprey tiltrotor aircraft should be considered for elimination He says the military can shrink but Norfolk shouldn t be affected because the Navy will still want to use its natural deepwater port He says pensions and other benefits shouldn t be changed for those in the system but doesn t know whether changes should be made for new service members IMMIGRATION Warner voted for broad immigration reform approved by the Senate in Provisions include allowing people living here illegally to take steps toward citizenship more investment in border security visa programs for high tech and low skill workers and an E Verify program to confirm workers legal statuses Under the bill immigrants without proper documents could obtain provisional immigrant status if they meet certain conditions including not having a criminal conviction After years and several steps they could apply for citizenship Gillespie supports granting visas but not citizenship to the millions of people living here illegally after they complete a multistep process including criminal background checks payment of back taxes assimilation and demonstration of self sufficiency He wants stronger border security changes to the visa system and improvements to the E Verify system so that employers can be certain their workers are not here illegally Sarvis favors easing quotas to allow millions more to emigrate here and supports granting legal status to those here illegally if they haven t broken other laws He says after paying penalties they should eventually be allowed to become citizens BUDGET AND DEBT Warner has pressed for a bipartisan approach to reduce deficit spending and slow the growth of the trillion national debt He proposed shrinking deficits by cutting spending raising more revenue by eliminating some tax exemptions and loopholes and changing entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare He opposes changes for those who are retired or nearing retirement but he says the financing of benefits for future retirees has to change He opposes a balanced budget constitutional amendment that prohibits deficit spending He voted for the Budget Control Act in that included a trigger to start more than trillion in automatic budget cuts over years called sequestration if Congress failed to agree on a plan to reduce deficit spending Lawmakers could not agree and the cuts including about billion to defense began in He called sequestration stupidity on steroids Gillespie said the government cannot sustain its borrowing and growth in debt and he favors changes to entitlement programs to keep them intact He supports a balanced budget amendment and opposes raising taxes other than possibly shifting one revenue source for another He says a tax increase won t help shrink the size of government and wants to lower the federal corporate income tax rate from to percent He would offset that by eliminating some deductions tax breaks and loopholes Gillespie wants to simplify the tax code including taking away deductions credits and loopholes for the wealthiest Americans And he wants to increase the per child income tax credit possibly by consolidating it with other credits such as for dependents child care and adoption He would also let the deduction rise with inflation He wants to replace the earned income tax credit for low and moderate income taxpayers with wage enhancement tax credits to help low income workers stay on the job rather than seek unemployment benefits He said he would work to end sequestration but has not proposed a plan Sarvis wants to shrink the federal government substantially He wants a balanced budget amendment as long as it s balanced with cuts but no new revenue He wants to simplify the income tax code by removing all exemptions and deductions and favors abolishing the income tax or the payroll tax He says Social Security shouldn t change for those at or near retirement but future retirees should be less reliant on younger people to pay their benefits He prefers individual retirement accounts ABORTION Warner supports abortion rights saying he opposes efforts to restrict or criminalize reproductive health care decisions He s opposed to the Supreme Court s Hobby Lobby ruling that exempts certain business owners from providing insurance that covers contraception if it violates their religious beliefs He backs legislation to undo the court ruling and says such decisions should be left up to a woman not her boss Gillespie opposes abortion except in cases of rape and incest or if the mother s life is in danger He says society must protect the most vulnerable among us including the unborn The alternative should be adoption he says and government should make it easier to adopt or provide foster care He praised the Hobby Lobby ruling saying it affirmed our freedom of religion Sarvis supports abortion rights and says the federal government shouldn t be involved SAME SEX MARRIAGE Warner supports same sex marriage and voted for the repeal of the military s Don t Ask Don t Tell policy that banned openly gay service members He was a co sponsor of the Respect for Marriage Act that would allow gay couples legally married in one state to have their unions honored for federal purposes such as collecting Social Security if they move to a state that doesn t recognize same sex marriages Gillespie says marriage should be only between a man and a woman but says some legal protections for same sex couples such as hospital visitation rights and survivor benefits should be allowed He says gay marriage laws should be decided by states He supported the federal Defense of Marriage Act that prohibited gay couples from being recognized as married under federal law until the prohibition was overturned by the Supreme Court in Sarvis supports same sex marriage ENERGY Warner Offshore drilling He favors drilling for gas and oil off Virginia s coast and has introduced legislation to speed up the timetable for exploration and drilling He will support offshore drilling only if Virginia is given a portion of the revenue He wants federal officials to more than double the size of Virginia s share of the off shore drilling planning area Under the current federal map the state has a relatively small triangular area about miles off the Eastern Shore Keystone XL Pipeline He supports the mile pipeline to carry oil from Canada to refineries near the Gulf of Mexico Has urged President Barack Obama to approve the project Coal He has not said whether he supports Obama s proposed rule to decrease carbon emissions from coal fired power plants by percent by He wants to nudge the coal industry to find innovations for cleaner coal and says Virginia has competing interests on climate change with coalfields in the southeast and rising seas in Hampton Roads He had supported a cap and trade approach to limit carbon emissions by giving industries measurable allowances or credits that could be bought or sold but he now says that approach cannot be successful in the U S or overseas Gillespie Offshore drilling He favors drilling for gas and oil off Virginia s coast with a requirement that Virginia share the revenue He wants the state s portion of the off shore drilling planning area to more than double in size Keystone XL Pipeline He supports the project saying Obama s delay in approving an application until at least the end of deprived the nation of an economic engine Coal He opposes the proposed rule to decrease carbon emissions from coal fired power plants by percent by He said it would raise energy prices kill jobs and hurt the economy He opposes any new carbon taxes Sarvis Offshore drilling He favors drilling for gas and oil off Virginia s coast but only if there are strict liability rules so that producers bear the cost of environmental damage Keystone XL Pipeline He supports the project as long as long as there are strong liability rules in place He says private companies building the pipeline shouldn t be allowed to use the government s eminent domain power to buy land from its owners Coal He says coal should be able to compete in the energy market but repairing pollution damage must be included it its cost MINIMUM WAGE Warner supports raising the an hour federal minimum wage to an hour phased in over several years He says workers ought to be able to feed their families with a minimum wage job Gillespie opposes raising the minimum wage and says that decision should be made by state or local governments He wants to keep the federal an hour minimum as a floor Sarvis opposes raising the minimum wage",0

Lawmakers of both parties indicated Congress likely will approve the request in the end. A senior administration official said the additional military and reconstruction funds would not be offset by spending cuts or tax increases but would be tacked onto the federal deficit which is expected to reach a record billion next year Nevertheless the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the deficit was still manageable and could be halved in five years as the president recently promised The Bush request comes after he already has asked Congress to approve a number of expensive items including a drug plan for seniors and making his tax cuts permanent The White House believes that its economic growth policies which largely consist of tax cuts will increase tax revenues The official also said the billion was a one time expenditure that would not add to the long term federal costs Democrats said they do not want to squeeze social programs or add to the federal red ink They believe the administration is underestimating the costs in Iraq a burden that will be shifted to future generations If this is war and American lives are at stake it s fair to ask Are we going to share the sacrifice or charge the cost to the national debt and pass it on to our children said Rep John Spratt D S C the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee Spratt said Bush should consider rolling back tax cuts for upper income people scheduled to go into effect in future years to defray the costs in Iraq Republicans who control the Senate and the House said that while Bush s request would be scrutinized he was likely to get much if not all of it People will have an opportunity to vet the request said Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Richard Lugar R Ind But life goes on and we really need to go ahead with the president s plan Administration officials said they hope to have the funds approved before Congress breaks for this year which could be as late as December On Monday the White House provided a more detailed breakdown of the president s request which Bush revealed to the nation in a televised address Sunday evening The bulk of the funds billion would go for additional military needs in Iraq and Afghani stan including million for body armor and million for heavily armored Humvees It also provides money for two weeks of break time outside the country for troops stationed for lengthy periods of time in the region The request also includes million to help transport troops from other nations who have volunteered to participate in Iraq but who have limited resources The president is seeking billion for reconstruction needs including billion to provide drinking water to open ports railroad lines and restore electricity and oil production The request includes billion for training of border and customs personnel a new Iraqi army and a police force A senior administration official conceded that the United States initially underestimated the cost to repair Iraq s infrastructure which the official said was worse than anyone on the outside anticipated However the official said that once Iraq s oil production is restored the country can begin contributing to the reconstruction effort The official estimated that Iraqi oil revenue would reach billion in and billion in and Some critics expressed doubt that the administration could pay for the military and reconstruction needs and still reduce the deficit in five years Robert Greenstein the executive director for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities a liberal think tank said that neither the president nor Congress has been willing to make the tough choices in recent years to bring down the deficit We don t make any choices that may cause concern to the voting public he said While Bush has said he wants to keep federal spending limited to about percent annually spending has actually increased percent since he took office according to the center Michael O Hanlon a defense expert at the Brookings Institution said that while the military spending requested by the president appears to be a little high he added I don t think the number is crazy WAR COST IN PERSPECTIVE For fiscal year President Bush will ask Congress for an additional billion for military costs and reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan How the cost compares to federal spending in selected categories fiscal year Education billion Highways billion Homeland Security Department billion Environmental Protection Agency billion",0

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP)--New York Gov. George Pataki proposed a $110.7 billion state budget plan Tuesday that would reduce property, income and business taxes by $3.2 billion even while pumping up spending on education and energy independence.   The Republican proposing his last state budget while eyeing a run for the White House in would increase spending by a rate above inflation while closing what he called a modest million budget gap The budget also calls for several tax incentives to lure and enhance business in New York Pataki s budget proposal for typical New Yorkers would reduce local tax bills help with some home heating bills and provide substantial increases in funding for schools and public colleges without calling for a tuition increase at state or New York City universities Those measures would include Direct property tax rebates of to home owners as part of an enhanced STAR program that uses state funds to pay part of local school taxes Senior citizens would also get automatic cost of living increases in their state payment A pro family tax cut package that reduces the income taxes eliminates the so called marriage penalty in income taxes and eliminates the estate tax A heating tax credit for lower income senior citizens A million increase in school aid to billion both of which would mark records in spending A per child tax credit for parents with children living in districts with underperforming schools billion in business tax cuts to spur job growth Let s remain committed to creating jobs and improving our economic climate building up our fiscal reserves cutting taxes restraining spending and debt and enacting major reforms like those that have made our state a better place Pataki said in his budget statement The current budget for the fiscal year ending March is now projected to total about billion Pataki proposed increasing the state s total reserves to billion and using the billion surplus from the current state budget to reduce gaps projected for coming years Pataki noted the use of the surplus would reduce the budget gap to billion which he said is much smaller than the one he inherited in from Democratic Gov Mario Cuomo I like the tax cutting ideas said E J McMahon director of the fiscally conservative Empire Center for New York State Policy Unfortunately they are very backloaded and the total state spending increase is eye opening For example the end of the so called marriage penalty in paying state income tax and the end of the estate tax on families would be phased in over several years and after a new governor takes over He said state spending alone excluding federal funds would increase under Pataki s proposal It s a spending plan on a par with the budgets during the boom years of the late s and pre Sept McMahon said He noted state spending would increase times the inflation rate The problem is again it s setting the floor fairly high because the Legislature will only add to this He said last year s state spending increase of proposed by Pataki grew to by the time the governor and the Legislature agreed on a budget The full bore increase this year could be close to given their proclivities in an election year McMahon agreed with Pataki however that he is passing along a smaller budget gap to his successor McMahon said the gap is smaller than the one passed on by governors in previous decades GMT",0

"RALEIGH, N.C. Ã¢â‚¬â€ With new online health insurance exchanges set to launch Tuesday, consumers in many Southern and Plains states will have to look harder for information on how the marketplaces work than their counterparts elsewhere.

Ã¢â‚¬â€ With new online health insurance exchanges set to launch Tuesday, consumers in many Southern and Plains states will have to look harder for information on how the marketplaces work than their counterparts elsewhere.

In Republican-led states that oppose the federal Affordable Care Act, the strategy has ranged from largely ignoring the health overhaul to encouraging residents not to sign up and even making it harder for nonprofit organizations to provide information about the exchanges. Health care experts worry that ultimately consumers in these states could end up confused about the exchanges and the overall rollout of the law could be hindered Without the shared planning and the cooperation of the state government it s much harder for them to be ready to implement this complicated law said Rachel Grob of the University of Wisconsin Madison who has studied differences in how states are implementing segments of the law Several of the Northeast Midwest and Western states running their own insurance exchanges have spent weeks on marketing and advertising campaigns to help residents get ready to buy health insurance At least million will be spent on publicity explaining what people need to do next and persuading the doubtful to sign up for coverage according to data compiled The Associated Press By contrast most states across the South have declined federal grants to advertise the exchanges and ceded the right to run the marketplaces themselves And early Sunday the Republican led U S House added to legislation that would avert a partial government shutdown a one year delay of the creation of the marketplaces Democrats have said delaying the health care law would sink the bill and the White House promised a veto Governors from the Carolinas to Kansas have decried the exchanges and the rest of the law which was passed by Congress in and many argue reaffirmed when voters re elected President Obama in The Supreme Court in upheld the constitutionality of most of the law a piece of the Medicaid expansion was an exception When it came to Obamacare we didn t just say no we said never South Carolina Gov Nikki Haley said last month alongside U S Sen Tim Scott whom she appointed last December when Jim DeMint resigned And we re going to keep on fighting until we get people like Sen Scott and everybody else in Congress to defund Obamacare Others have gone beyond fiery rhetoric Missouri s lieutenant governor urged residents to refuse to sign up for federal health insurance while Kansas legislators and the state s governor enacted a law symbolically declaring that residents can t be forced to buy health insurance In Florida state officials ordered county health departments to bar from their property navigators hired under federal grants to explain the plan s complexities Broward County commissioners last week ignored that ban and voted to allow navigators and other counselors into county offices including health departments We ve encountered many many issues with this and this is a breakthrough for us to be able to go into the libraries the health departments said Jerson Dulis who was trained to help enroll people in the state exchange He works for Broward Community Family Health Centers Inc which received a federal grant to provide consumers understand and enroll in health insurance plans In places where state officials have declined to disseminate information the work is left to nonprofit organizations and word of mouth among consumers North Carolina is among the states that have left the running of its exchange to the federal government This year the state refunded what remained of a million federal grant that would have helped consumers and linked computers Asa Gregory of Wilson works sporadically as a substitute public school teacher and has lacked health insurance for seven years paying the medical bills after a traffic accident with help from his parents I would like to have health insurance I think that s a no brainer he said Gregory said he s been checking out the government s information web site at www healthcare gov but feels there s certainly quite a bit for me to learn I d say percentagewise what do I know about what s happening on October st I d say maybe percent he said I m not confident that I know a majority of the information but it s gathering and I m looking at it I m preparing for the opportunity of the marketplace Sherry Graham said she s hoping insurance company competition will drive down the price she pays for her daughter s individual coverage Graham said rising premiums force her to squeeze her pension and Social Security checks to pay her daughter s monthly insurance premium because the younger woman works only part time Every year here I am trying to find another or so to add to the monthly premium to keep her insured said Graham of Raleigh It s enough to hurt I have to figure out where to get that money from because I m not getting a raise like ever In response to confusion over the health overhaul officials in the Carolinas have grudgingly made moves to lessen disruptions North Carolina Gov Pat McCrory s health agency recently urged county social services departments to discuss the insurance exchanges when people come in seeking food stamps or child care help The Republican governor s administration also encouraged social services agencies to offer space as available to navigators In South Carolina which also left advertising and running the exchange to the federal government the state Medicaid agency ramped up its call center to handle percent more calls as people have questions about the law deputy director John Supra said Others are taking a harder line Florida Republicans are vehemently pushing back against implementing parts of the law The Florida Department of Health recently ordered county health departments across the state to ban navigators from conducting outreach on their property Florida has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country with an estimated million lacking insurance Gov Rick Scott a vocal opponent of the law has echoed GOP talking points about privacy concerns penning a letter last week to top congressional leaders expressing concern about the security of people s personal information as they sign up for health coverage under Scott s strong opposition has drawn sharp criticism from Democrats It seems that Gov Scott and his staff spend their days conjuring up new ways to keep Floridians in the dark about health care choices coming Oct U S Rep Ted Deutch said at a recent meeting with a handful of navigators In Kansas a law Republican legislators and Gov Sam Brownback enacted declared that residents can t be forced to buy health insurance or penalized The measure was largely a symbolic protest given supremacy of the federal law Missouri bars state employees from helping implement an insurance exchange leaving it entirely to federal direction Last week Lt Gov Peter Kinder this week urged Missouri residents to resist the federal law by refusing to sign up for health insurance They could be forced to pay a fine of or more if they don t I don t see any reason to enable the implementation of this law Kinder said I think the whole thing is in the process of

Moeco said earlier that it had received as of Nov invoices in connection with the oil spill for reimbursement of a total amount of billion from the BP unit that was the operator of the well Kagawa said late Wednesday that MOEX Offshore is a limited liability company which means all investors in it can be held responsible only for amounts up to what they have invested Therefore if the amount MOEX Offshore has to pay surpasses its ability Moeco can let it go bankrupt It also hasn t been determined whether MOEX Offshore will have to pay part of the costs and if so how much he said A Moeco official Thursday declined to say how much has been invested in the project citing a confidentiality agreement Mitsui Co TO which owns of Moeco last week reported that group net profit in the July September quarter more than doubled from a year earlier due to surging commodity and energy prices The Japanese trading house said in its financial statement that it didn t book any reserves or financial liabilities related to the oil spill saying there is uncertainty about how to calculate the total claimed amount and Moeco s liability would be zero as of Sept at the minimum level if certain conditions are met in the joint operating agreement The Gulf of Mexico oil spill began April when BP s Deepwater Horizon drilling platform exploded It took BP roughly five months to stop the leak and seal the well BP booked billion in costs related to the leak in the April June quarter Other companies including oil rig operator Transocean Ltd RIG and oil services company Halliburton Co HAL which performed cementing work on the well might be held responsible Moeco is owned by the Japanese government Fourteen Japanese companies separately hold the remainder Along with Moeco s stake U S oil company Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC has while BP owns the remainder of the project Anadarko has said it won t pay bills related to the spill while a federal investigation is ongoing By Mari Iwata Dow Jones Newswires mari iwata dowjones com ET",0

New research provides insight into the promise and perils of disclosure as a policy tool. At its worst, disclosure is a waste of time and resources, draining millions of dollars from the financial services industry and achieving few measurable improvements in investor outcomes. At its best, disclosure can instantly achieve efficiency improvements within markets where itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult for investors to assess price or quality. KNOWLEDGE LIMITS First some basic consumer theory Investors make the best decisions they can but are limited by their knowledge Collecting knowledge can be costly A new employee must select among numerous investment options by reading through fund prospectuses or looking for cues of growth Most people have made investments in learning a work related skill in order to earn a living but they haven t made an investment in how to be their own pension manager But creating million pension managers doesn t sound like a sensible public policy goal One way to help workers is to give them the information they need to make better choices This is the appeal of information policy If ignorance is the problem then give them a detailed brochure that contains everything they d need to know to make a better choice Unfortunately consumers may have no idea what to do with this information And more information makes the problem worse There is perhaps no sadder example of failed information policy than the mutual fund prospectus At an SEC roundtable Don Phillips Morningstar s president of investment research said that fund prospectuses were bombarding investors with way more information than they can handle and that they can intelligently assimilate To its credit the SEC tried to streamline the fund prospectus to only the most important information Unfortunately research shows that investors given a simplified prospectus still focus the most on fund characteristics that are irrelevant like past performance and ignore characteristics that matter like fees Disclosure can even be counterproductive In a paper Sunita Sah then at Duke University and George Loewenstein of Carnegie Mellon University found that advisors were more likely to give self serving advice if they first disclosed a conflict of interest to their client When an advisor admits to a conflict of interest in a face to face transaction this creates two problems First the client now feels that if they don t accept the recommendation they are admitting they don t trust the advisor something that is taboo in human interactions The second problem is that the advisor now feels less pressure to make a recommendation that isn t self serving It is as if one can absolve one s sins by admitting to being a sinner The authors found that recommendations given by participants in the role of advisor were significantly worse for the consumer if they had to disclose conflicts of interest Examples may include the ADV Part among RIAs or any number of client disclosures required by FINRA Duane Thompson president of consulting firm Potomac Strategies notes that different disclosure requirements among regulators of financial advisors add to the confusion Disclosure across regulatory authorities in the financial services industry varies considerably even when financial intermediaries provide the same kind of retail advice such as retirement planning Differences in the latitude given to advisors in making self serving recommendations don t help either GETTING IT RIGHT The most effective financial disclosure laws have given consumers a little bit of very important information that is easy to use A great example is the disclosure of a consistent interest rate in banking products the APR mandated by the Truth in Lending Act Before the act banks could play games by varying the compounding period or other product characteristics in order to take advantage of less sophisticated consumers With the APR comparing terms was a piece of cake and anyone could easily select a competitive CD University of Chicago professor Eugene Fama found that consumer CD rates were basically identical to the similar duration bond rates obtained by more sophisticated investors It is easy for consumers to compare a single number That s why gas stations go out of business if they charge for a gallon of gas that costs down the street Many financial markets such as year fixed rate mortgages savings accounts and property insurance are much more competitive because it is easy for consumers to compare one number for products that have similar characteristics Retirement investments aren t so easy Nothing about the defined contribution retirement system in America is particularly efficient U S Rep George Miller D Calif famously posed with three quarters of a pie to illustrate the estimated of retirement savings lost to excessive plan administrator fees over a worker s lifetime Investments within retirement accounts tend to be expensive not very well diversified and not necessarily appropriate for the worker s life cycle stage A well functioning market for retirement assets would provide healthy competition among plan adminstrators to improve the quality of advising services and lower the cost of investing options Is disclosure the answer University of Michigan business law professor Dana Muir believes that there is room for improved disclosure within the retirement industry if the right information is disclosed to the right people There is a significant body of research questioning the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure says Muir Studies in a variety of disciplines indicate that disclosure often fails to enable the person receiving the disclosure to act more rationally than the person would have acted in the absence of the disclosure For disclosure to work those who get the information need to know what to do with it This is the problem with giving more information to workers They don t necessarily know how to use investment information to select appropriate retirement funds Muir thinks that fee and compensation disclosures to plan sponsors are more likely to have an effect on plan fee levels than disclosures to plan participants Plan sponsors have an incentive in meeting fiduciary obligations to consider fee and compensation information Disclosure seems to work a lot better in markets with informed participants who have an incentive to use new information New York University professor David Yermack found that the mere mention that a CEO was flying a corporate airplane for personal use within an SEC K form led to a same day drop of in the firm s stock price There is no doubt that mandating firm disclosure through the SEC to investors has improved the stability and efficiency of the U S equity market In retirement savings markets where employees must participate but often don t have the knowledge to make complex choices the best choice may be no choice at all This is the logic behind providing safe harbor to plan sponsors who select qualified default investment alternatives QDIAs for their employees If the default investment is generally appropriate for the worker s life cycle stage then most investors can avoid making bad choices Muir however doesn t think the plan sponsors should be on the hook in a system of investment defaults The sponsors often don t know more about selecting the right QDIA than employees particularly if they are small businesses in non finance fields And giving employees more disclosure about the risks of a default investment defeats the purpose of a default system That s why Muir believes that the primary job of the plan sponsor as a fiduciary should be to select the right plan administrator Leave it to the experts to select and defend which QDIAs to include in the plan New rulemaking by the U S Department of Labor is meant to provide disclosure to plan sponsors to help them select the right plan vendor Joseph Piacentini chief economist and director of policy research at the DOL s Employee Benefits Security Administration imagines that easier access to pricing will both help employers shop around and enhance competition among providers Piacentini notes that the rule will lay the groundwork for a more price competitive market not just on the demand side but also on the supply side Low cost vendors will attempt to poach business from their higher cost competitors Disclosure transparency as a regulatory tool works by affecting the behavior of the party receiving the disclosure but also the behavior of the party who must disclose something This is why some within the industry are seeing disclosure as an opportunity rather than a burden Lance Hocutt an advisor for Ameriprise Financial in Tuscaloosa Ala is looking forward to the opportunity to compete To him the new disclosure rules really help those advisors and plans who already provide full disclosure level the playing field And price isn t the only way to compete many employers look for a mix of cost and services when assessing an advisor s value I have a specific client service model for each plan which includes an annual education plan quarterly meeting dates and events Hocutt sees the much needed personalized service he provides to sponsors and employees as an informed advisor s greatest asset Until the low cost competition will put a broker in front of plans Hocutt sees a place for advisors who can provide the right level of service at the right price Disclosure may have a role in improving retirement security for Americans after all But regulators need to recognize when disclosure works and when it is a smokescreen that gets in the way of more effective policy The defined contribution retirement system is here to stay It s in everyone s interest to make sure employees get high quality plans at the right price Michael Finke Ph D is a professor and coordinator of the doctoral program in personal financial planning at Texas Tech University",0

The mood was overwhelmingly optimistic coming out of a year of global uncertainty - politically, economically and even in spirit, as terrorism touched our shores and broke our hearts. The people who go to the Portsea Polo are a mixed bunch it s not all wealthy multi generational Portsea families So I went in curious to hear what those present thought might be in store for them in Some I spoke to drew comparisons with their industries as economic barometers and on those occasions the only way was up Overall the view was one of hope but there are some areas of weakness Ultimately it might come down to playing to our strengths and appreciating the good moments while they re here One person on a high and enjoying a good moment was Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop It was little wonder she looked so resplendent and confident given she d produced one of the more inspirational performances among our politicians last year She practically swanned into the Jeep marquee with the debonair local businessman David Panton by her side Animated and fun Panton must be a breath of fresh air for Bishop not to mention a salve for her eyes given what she s had to deal with and look at among her colleagues on the job On light duties but happy to chat Bishop says she d hoped would begin on a brighter happier note than but the shocking events in Paris and the loss of the AirAsia flight put an end to that notion In some respects has begun as ended Bishop says In terms of her portfolio she plans to focus more on building relationships with those in the Indian Ocean Asia Pacific region It s where Australia can make the biggest difference and have the most influence and I think Australia s standing in the world is at its highest when our influence in our region is at its strongest Referencing the upbeat mood around her at the polo she says Australians were naturally optimistic people but it was up to the government to help facilitate opportunity in and beyond I believe that there is a sense of confidence that times will be better And that s the role of the government to ensure we have in place the national security and national economic framework to boost that confidence Over at the Portsea Polo Club marquee chef Ian Curley of The European wasn t so sure about the upbeat outlook Despite having just opened another wine bar in Melbourne s Hardware Lane he believes will be tough for eateries I m running away from restaurants says Curley who plans to focus more on consulting and public appearances If you re going to open a restaurant these days you need a big backer but even then you re still not going to make that much money He predicts many big names in restaurants will struggle this year and that high profile chefs will increasingly lend their hands to charity Later in the Italian Riviera themed Peroni marquee I tried to track down under pressure Australia Post CEO Ahmed Fahour to find out where things sat with his plan to lift the price of stamps from to Missing him I went in search of Jayco founder Gerry Ryan but instead found myself face to face with his son Andrew which was OK with me I was soon mesmerised Sure Ryan had a lot of really interesting things to say about the five or so family businesses he helps run but I couldn t help but be distracted by his shock of rust coloured waves There s just something about red haired men Concentration was tricky but the upshot of what he said was that caravans aren t a bad economic indicator with sales up in the good times and off when things are flat The whole caravan industry s going well but Jayco s increased market share and is flying Ryan says Orders are up per cent on this time last year and retail sales were per cent better in than they were in calendar he says We re doing a caravan every minutes so if you re looking at that I guess there s hope for the economy Back in the Jeep marquee I came across the tireless managing director of Melbourne s Langham Hotel Ben Sington He was on the hunt for brand allegiances and sponsorships because he expects will be a big year in hospitality particularly for the southern capital With the lower Australian dollar already attracting more international guests and encouraging more domestic travel among the locals Sington was confident a string of extra sports events in Melbourne in the cricket World Cup the Asian Cup football and International Champions Cup soccer extravaganza would inflate numbers still further These are all big events for Melbourne and five star hotels get that kind of business Sington says As the polo ended my driver whisked me off to the less crowded Western Port Bay side of the Peninsula where I joined fellow Flinders Yacht Club members for the annual Commodore s Cocktail soiree They may be a down to earth bunch over there but they re every bit as aware of the long term issues we face as a nation In their sport they might have found one of the best ways to a happier Commodore Rod Slater summed it up thus When you re out there in a yacht on the water with a tiller in your hand it s a sport where you really are so involved in what you re doing it s the ideal way to put the world

It s probably the biggest retirement question you have after Do I have enough money to retire Where should I live in retirement The question really needs to be split in half Which community and neighborhood should I live in And what kind of home should I live in Right place right time In his excellent new book Right Place Right Time author Ryan Frederick has some smart ideas to help you answer both questions about where to live in the second half of life He shared them with me when I interviewed him for Next Avenue and for the new episode of the podcast I co host Friends Talk Money You can hear the episode wherever you get podcasts Place often gets overlooked when people think about how they can live a long healthy life Frederick said People don t understand how important place is in the context of healthy aging Many of us spend too much time focusing on what a prospective home s primary bedroom and appliances look like he noted and not enough about the social connections we ll have and can make in the area the home is in Frederick who incidentally hates moving is a consultant and researcher whose company SmartLiving focuses on the nexus between real estate and living longer lives Also read We want to retire to a fun lake house but we also want city amenities Our budget is Where should we go But he also speaks with authority about where to live in your s and s based on personal experience Frederick and his family moved from Baltimore to Austin Texas two years ago though he concedes he didn t do everything right It s all going to work out but we would have been better off had we done a little more research years in advance he said Researching communities and neighborhood To do your research Frederick suggests reviewing the Milken Institute s Best Cities for Successful Aging and AARP s Livability Index For neighborhoods he noted there s Nextdoor com And to see how walkable an area might be Frederick said Redfin com has a Walk Score for addresses around the U S See The best little cities to live in the U S in One perhaps unexpected type of research Frederick recommends when choosing an area is scoping out how well poised it is for the future After all you ll probably be living there for years if not decades ahead You want to be in a place where it has a certain dynamic component to it where there s additional opportunities to grow and earn money in different ways Frederick said That also means assessing whether the area will likely be able to attract workers who will provide the kinds of services you may want and need including long term care Friends Talk Money podcast co host Pam Krueger advised beginning your research by coming up with a short list of possible areas maybe five ones where you can actually see yourself living day to day she said not a vacation location See We want to live in a medium sized city close to the beach but without much traffic Where should we retire Be sure to look into access to excellent health facilities Friends Talk Money podcast co host Terry Savage said she did that when deciding to move to Lake Nona Fla a planned community near Orlando Medicine was really important to me I just know that the older you get the more the possibilities are that you might need some emergency care she said Near her there s a medical complex called Lake Nona Medical City where the MD Anderson Orlando Cancer Research Institute is Savage added Check outMarketWatch s Help Me Retire page Krueger also recommended checking out the tax system where you might want to live I would rather live in a state where I might be able to reduce my expenses including taxes she said There are nine states that don t have an income tax and about a dozen that don t have any estate or inheritance taxes Picking a particular home When choosing a particular place to live a house townhouse condo retirement community or apartment Frederick said figure out what you re going to need in your personal space One of the sad things I see is you find people that love their home love their neighborhood but there s some fatal flaw in their house that will force them to move elsewhere earlier than they might prefer he said Also see Where s the best place for me to retire MarketWatch s updated tool warns you of climate risks while helping you find your dream spot Sometimes when choosing a home you need to put your foot down to ensure changes are made to it so you can live there more easily as you get older Frederick did that We did a little bit of landscaping change in the front of his Austin house he said I had to convince our landscape architect that you could have a no stairs entry a walkway and have that be attractive He was convinced otherwise So there was some education around that Said Savage I think part of this is just thinking about what s the environment that will make you happy You don t want to buy a three story house with your bedroom on the top floor because you may

 Mr Ray and his wife who live near Dover had rented a villa near Benidorm for three months from January but were forced to return four weeks into the trip Two of those weeks were spent by Mr Ray in a Spanish hospital Mr Ray said We took the car to a car wash and I remember coming out but that was the last thing I saw The couple were flown home two weeks later by air ambulance and Mr Ray then spent four weeks in hospital All expenses were met by the couple s single trip Home Overseas travel insurance policy from Zurich which they arranged through an adviser at Bradford Bingley Marketplace The couple paid to cover their three months overseas Mr Ray said I think going abroad without travel insurance is probably the biggest mistake you could make I understand the cost of getting home can be as high as from Spain Most of the time I was unconscious so I could not have made any arrangements myself It was a shame our holiday was ruined but it could have been a lot worse",0

"As the dust settled two years ago at the end of the most recent bear market, many investors were forced to pick up the pieces of their investment portfolio and retirement accounts. Most equity mutual funds ended the period down more than 40%, and it seemed as though the investment landscape would never be the same. This downturn broke all the rules about padding one's portfolio with proper asset allocation. The problem was that as the global markets crashed, the correlation between opposing asset classes began to increase.

As money began to come back into the market, investors and advisors thought differently about portfolio creation and diversification. Both a higher level of risk aversion and the case for better risk diversification had been made, with the impact seen in allocations and products. On the core side, exchange-traded products began to proliferate and garner large amounts of assets.

"Hedge funds

Employing a specialist manager to create a hedge fund portfolio is a good option for retail investors.","Hedge funds

Employing a specialist manager to create a hedge fund portfolio is a good option for retail investors. The credibility of hedge funds has been bolstered in recent years by a number of high profile and respected fund managers entering the market But rather than employing hedge fund strategies themselves these fund managers have brought a high degree of critical analysis and technical know how to the process of putting together portfolios of hedge funds so called fund of fund products and making them available to a wide range of investors Investors confidence has been further heightened by the fact that the fund of fund managers have been prepared to put in some cases a significant amount of their own capital into the same funds that they re asking investors to buy The fund of fund structure has benefits for investors namely the comfort that comes from the research or due diligence carried out on the underlying managers and the benefits of diversifying across a range of underlying managers and investment styles In addition unlike investing directly into a single strategy hedge fund there is a low minimum capital requirement in most FOF vehicles An investment in FOF allows the investor to gain access to several funds with a much smaller investment than would be required for an investment in each In some cases the initial investment is as little as But diversification is the key attraction for investors putting money into a fund of fund structure It reduces an investor s exposure to individual strategy manager and fund risk Typically hedge fund managers like ourselves design a portfolio from the bottom up and from the top down selecting managers on the basis of their skill in a particular area of expertise Colonial First State s head of hedge funds Damien Hatfield says Diversification across managers using the same strategy does little to benefit investors and is like holding a share portfolio of similar stocks such as mining companies he says A portfolio built in that way lacks diversification and is completely exposed to risks that adversely affect that sector such as moves in commodity prices A professional fund manager typically has the resources to commit to researching the skills and expertise of individual hedge fund managers and the analytical firepower to carry out extensive modelling and backtesting to come up with the optimal mix of manager and strategy Analysing and investing in hedge funds requires quantitative and qualitative assessment is time consuming and usually beyond the capabilities of the average investor Hedge Funds of Australia s managing director Spencer Young says This lack of capability to perform due diligence generally relates to a range of issues including location of the funds themselves technical skills required of the investor to understand and dissect sophisticated investment strategies lack of access to confidential and reliable market information high minimum investment requirements lack of access to the best funds which are typically closed and the ability to perform monitoring of the manager Even though the process of analysing and combining hedge funds is time consuming and complex there are simple issues that investors should focus on before determining whethera hedge fund investment is right for them Deutsche Bank for example suggests a list of questions that investors should be able to answer yes to before committing money to a fund of hedge funds see table above right However in general the analysis of underlying fund managers is aimed at minimising an investor s exposure to three general areas of risk Misrepresentation fraud risk not telling the truth Market investment strategy risk poor investment strategy or not doing what they said they would Business operational risk inadequate administration process procedures and reporting These general areas have in the past decade led either individually or in combination to the most significant hedge fund failures Some of the other areas that the fund of fund managers assess before deciding whether to employ a hedge fund manager include Management s motivation Integrity education employment history lifestyle attitude Its defined investment strategy whether an identifiable opportunity exists embedded market risks definition of investment process market knowledge in defined strategy Investment management capability portfolio management risk assessment and management ability strategy implementation experience in market conditions understanding the impact of market flows trading experience Funds under management critical mass verses manageable amount ability to manage growth quality and spread of investors Business operation back office infrastructure and reliability fee structure decision and execution process quality stability compensation and turnover of staff All this work comes at a cost to the investor however FOF and hedge fund managers don t consider themselves to be charities they expect to be reasonably rewarded for the effort that goes into constructing portfolios identifying researching and in the case of FOF managers continuously monitoring other fund managers But as a trade off FOF managers will often negotiate lower fees with their underlying managers than an individual investor could achieve if investing directly in the underlying specialist manager Despite the massive changes that have taken place in the industry a lack of transparency can still be an issue with some hedge fund managers And not all FOFs disclose with whom they invest This is most often explained as a competitive measure or as required by the underlying specialist manager However often the FOF manager will have greater insight into the underlying managers individual positions and styles than the average investor and is in a better position to perform due diligence POINT CHECK Answer yes to all of these questions before committing money to a hedge fund Is the fund managed by a global and experienced absolute return investment manager How committed is the investment manager to absolute return investments do they have their own capital committed Does the investment manager have sufficient resources to monitor the managers strategies and performance globally on an ongoing basis Does the investment manager have access to the top funds and investment capacity going forward Are the decision makers based in your region or are you simply dealing with a sales and marketing team Does the investment vehicle meet the local tax and regulatory requirements as well as provide limited liability Is the investment vehicle protected from currency fluctuations Does the fund report to investors frequently and with transparency Does the fund use a rigorous performance fee calculation including a hurdle rate and high water mark Does the manager manage money on behalf of institutional investors typically institutions are more diligent in their investment process Source Deutsche Asset Management",0

 The European wealthy appear to love going to see their private bankers in Geneva or Lugano for them the cachet of the Swiss bank account where private banking was born in the th century seems undiminished While the North Americans are focused on capital markets the Europeans are more banking led Entrusting money to bankers for protection is deeply ingrained in the culture of the European wealthy who have witnessed far more social and political upheaval over the centuries than their American cousins Americans are generally more aggressive in their investment style using hedge funds for instance to a much greater extent But North American HNWIs are much more philanthropic and likely to give to charity helped by clear tax incentives to do so Figures suggest that America s rich are between two and five times more likely to donate to good causes",0

In a lengthy interview with ThinkAdvisor Inker who came to GMO right after graduating from Yale University years ago talks about the huge risk inherent in a Trump election a stock market bubble on the not so distant horizon what could easily trigger the next U S financial crisis the impact of Brexit and emerging markets among other issues critical to investors and advisors Inker is responsible for allocations of GMO s multi asset portfolios and portfolios that invest across equity regions Clients are chiefly sophisticated institutional investors For retail investors the firm is subadvisor for two Wells Fargo funds the Wells Fargo Asset Allocation Fund EAAFX and the Wells Fargo Absolute Return Fund WARAX both of which Inker manages A member of GMO s board of directors he has held a variety of posts during his rise including chief investment officer of quantitative developed equities ThinkAdvisor recently spoke by phone with the Boston based chartered financial analyst who has spent his entire career to date at GMO Where did he get that job lead From David Swensen Yale s longtime CIO and one of his professors Grantham called asking if Swensen had any students who could be a good fit with GMO It s been two dozen years and counting for Inker Here are excerpts from our interview THINKADVISOR What impact will the presidential election have on the U S economy and stock market BEN INKER A government can manage to destroy an economy if it so chooses and it s possible that a sufficiently ill advised set of policies in the U S could do profound damage We now have a candidate for president who is capable of that It s very hard to know what a Trump presidency would be like but some of the things he has said would be really scary It s possible that a Trump election would be the exception to the rule that it doesn t much matter who is U S president from an investment standpoint What if Hillary Clinton is elected Whether she turned out to be a particularly good president or a particularly bad one it seems unlikely that she d do anything to change the nature of the U S economy in a profound fashion Jeremy Grantham is Are you next in line to succeed him We aren t trying to base the firm on having another Jeremy Grantham and the firm hasn t set itself up so that in order for it to succeed I must be Jeremy doesn t have any day to day responsibilities for the portfolios Over time he gave over his responsibility for the management of client assets My team and I function independently of him He comes in every day and is thinking about important investment topics that can have impact on the portfolios But I am the portfolio manager he is not Do you have lots of meetings with him and then decide how to proceed Jeremy is a member of our investment review group and we meet periodically to talk about big things that are going on But I have the end responsibility for determining what it is we re going to do Do you see any signs of a bubble occurring now The U S stock market is getting closer to two standard deviations overvalued relative to history which Grantham defines as a bubble But we aren t quite there yet Maybe when the S P is at or we could plausibly be talking about bubble levels What about a bubble in bonds It s very hard to call what s gone on in government bonds a bubble in the normal sense because bubbles are usually characterized by euphoria and very positive emotions whereas it seems anything but with regard to what s happened with bond yields What impact has Brexit had on your investing As people who are attempting to be long term investors we think the impact on the true long term fair value of most companies whose stocks are traded in the U K is just not that big a deal Nothing happened that was material enough to cause us to say We need to jump in now and do something about it Please talk about the U S dollar in light of Brexit Brexit didn t particularly cause the dollar to strengthen since part of the dollar s strength has been on the back of an assumption that the Fed was in a hiking mode whereas the rest of the world was absolutely not Brexit seemed to put Fed hikes on the table U S house prices might beat the U S equity market in the race to cause the next financial crisis Jeremy Grantham wrote in an update to his Q quarterly report Do you agree Yes you could easily see housing causing the next crisis Home prices have now made quite an impressive recovery from their post financial crisis low but are pretty expensive again Compared to stocks a home is an asset owned by a much larger swath of households for the vast majority of people it s their biggest asset and owned with a lot of leverage So you could imagine a problem in the housing market caused by a normalization of interest rates Some people will find it difficult to pay their mortgages So that could precipitate another bubble If there are continued increases in housing prices that could create another bubble and another bust The contagion of a debt fueled asset bubble housing is much worse than a cash fueled asset bubble equities It generally takes close to a generation for assets to return to bubbleness after a real bust for people to lose their memory of how painful that was But markets seem to lose their memory a lot more quickly than they used to What s your outlook for the U S stock market for the rest of this year We don t much like the U S stock market but the fact that the market is pretty expensive doesn t necessarily stop it from going up It s an overvalued market in a world where most things that are cheaper look scarier and the things that look lower risk are deeply unappealing whether cash government bonds or investment grade corporate bonds We don t think the market deserves to do particularly well So up or down slightly would be perfectly unexceptional In all the portfolios where I have an ability to express a view on the U S market my multiyear view is that U S stocks are less attractive than stocks in the rest of the world Mr Grantham wrote in his Immigration and Brexit report in July that the U S market will hang in or better at least through the election Agree The election cycle has had pretty good predictive power We re in the fourth year of an election cycle and historically with few exceptions you tend to have a modestly up and stable year So now through November if history is a guide that s the best guess If you own the cheaper stuff you ll eventually win Why is the U S market trading at a significant premium to that of the rest of the world A big part of it is that the U S seems safer The presidential election aside bearing in mind what I said about a Trump election being the notable exception somehow the political risks seem less extreme in the U S than in some other places The economy here is doing better The market has done better People have trouble imaging the U S losing because it has won for a long enough time When the U S does lose again which will inevitably happen sooner than later it s going to come as a nasty shock because right now people have trouble imagining it What do you forecast for earnings growth in the U S Over the next several years the U S should struggle to see much earnings growth and profits might well shrink a bit If the U S grows sustainably from here it s probably going to be on the back of household incomes and therefore wages growing faster than the overall economy which means falling profit margins What if the economy is weak There will probably be falling profit margins on the back of falling sales So the good news would be gently falling earnings as rising revenues are slightly more than countered by falling sales margins The bad case would be a recession where profits would fall more sharply What s your outlook for bonds If something happens that causes inflation to be a lot higher or a lot lower than expected that can give you either a wonderful windfall gain or blow a nasty hole in your portfolio that takes a long time to dissipate Your thoughts about high yield junk bonds High yield bonds are probably worth a place in your portfolio today But we owned more high yields this winter and spring than we do now Yields have gotten to quite attractive levels but a real concern is that though investors are probably getting close to adequately paid for default risk they re not getting paid very well because high yield bonds have become very illiquid assets So what specifically are the implications We as a firm have concerns that we might well be at the start of a default cycle Trailing month defaults in high yields in the U S have now peaked above the long term average A lot of that has to do with energy and mining We ve seen very few events in history where we ve had a move up through the long term average level that immediately went back down and things were safe for high yield investors So we ve got some concern that the next few years might be bad from a default level perspective How are high yield bonds priced compared to Treasuries No worse than Treasuries in the event of a bad outcome and better in the event of something better than that You ve been overweight emerging markets What s your take now If you talk to investors about emerging markets in general you get eye rolls head shakes and Oh man we ve lost so much money It s hard to imagine emerging markets turning around People have very low expectations for this asset class And when people have very low expectations for asset classes good things can happen Is that the situation right now Our head of emerging markets has long said that the real money there isn t made when things go to from good to great but when they go from absolutely horrible to merely terrible So we re happy holders of emerging market equities today because they re priced for pretty bad things and bad things aren t happening Looking at Brazil it doesn t seem like there s been a positive headline about it this year But the Brazilian stock market has been just about the best performing stock market in the world What significance does that example have to GMO For quite a while we ve had complaints from our clients that emerging can do well only when the emerging economics are firing on all cylinders and that in the absence of that emerging is doomed to lose We don t believe this Again when expectations are really bad you can get very good returns when merely less horrible things come to be Do you see less horrible things in the offing It hardly takes a stretch of the imagination to think so We believe emerging markets are priced at a level where if that happens they can perform They deserve to make money in real terms which is exciting in a world where so many assets are priced not to give returns over and above inflation Any downside to emerging markets We re still quite worried about the aggregate amount of credit growth in emerging across the last five or six years We re still seeing that certainly in China But all else equal I d rather have a cheap market with everybody convinced that nothing good can happen than an expensive market where everybody is convinced all it can do is go up Please talk a bit more about China Growth in China is worrying The question is Can you find stuff to own there that s relatively safe even in the event of a credit induced problem or possibly is cheap enough that even if it isn t safe in a credit induced problem the expectations are so bad for it that it will do OK Despite our concerns about the economy there s stuff worth owning in China Broadly in what market sectors do you see opportunity We re not primarily sector people but what s definitely striking today is sector valuations variance in different regions of the world That seems to have a lot to do with how comfortable people are with the local economy Can you talk specifics In the emerging world where people don t have particularly high expectations for growth or in Europe some of the more cyclical sectors such as consumer durables and industrials look pretty cheap In the U S where the economy has been fine for a long time and expectations seem to be that it will continue to be we still like some of the more defensive sectors though consumer non durables have done very well and some of the consumer product companies do look pretty fully valued What are your thoughts about oil Our best guess is that there isn t currently enough investment in energy production to meet the world s oil needs for the next four or five years So reasonably one could see the price of oil creeping up over that period As you look longer than that oil whose overwhelming use is as a transportation fuel has a meaningful risk of being kind of pushed aside in favor of electric transportation It s hard to know exactly whether that s going to be a big deal in the s or not But it s certainly a risk Back to Brexit How will Britain s leaving the European Union affect the U S dollar long term Even if Brexit does not have long term impact on the British economy one presumes the likelihood of a recession in the U K during this period is reasonably high and they re not going to raise interest rates into that So the U S dollar might be looking for an excuse to stay expensive or get more expensive I m more confident that seven years from now the dollar should be cheaper than it is than I am that a year or two from now it will have gone down not up Related on ThinkAdvisor GMO s Grantham Why the Stock Market Won t Collapse This Year Reasons Not to Dump Emerging

That s because retail banking units usually earn basis points in net interest margin while many robo advice offerings are priced much lower usually between and basis points on fees to remain competitive Banks don t want to move the assets from retail to robo unless they are sure they are flight risk Sievers said Otherwise you re repricing those deposits down It s a real problem Harvest s newest label products Goalkeeper and Signals are meant to address that issue said Sievers Goalkeeper provides banks the ability to offer the same sort of microplanning within accounts that apps such as Digit and Chime provide while Signals provides intelligence across accounts on customers so banks can offer them products when they are most likely to need them For example a customer could set up a goal of saving for college education in their savings account with Goalkeeper When the account nears the amount needed to open a account Signals would alert the bank Sievers said allowing it to effectively cross sell the customer With a solution that looks at data in real time across a bank he said it allows customers to fulfill different goals the bank is better positioned to deliver products and they don t lose to online lenders digital savings apps or direct to consumer robos like Betterment Sievers claimed that according to his firm s analysis banks are losing up to of deposits every year to microsavings and microinvesting apps such as Acorns and Robinhood as well as to traditional and digital first brokerages such as Schwab and Wealthfront Those are increasingly pairing up their digital advice products with checking and savings offerings he noted If the average growth rate for deposits is banks actually have to grow deposits by he said The increased crossover between savings and investments will push other startups to develop products that align banking offerings that have been traditionally separate said industry observers With the convergence of banking and investing in the robo space it s no surprise that fintech firms are getting into the game said Will Trout head of wealth management at Celent But while data and analytics can help bridge the gap between savings and advice offerings at banks there is also a cultural shift that institutions will need to undertake to grasp the value of doing so Trout said There is an inherent tension between the bank need for fee income on the one hand and the smaller margins that investment assets imply he said I m not sure coordination is the problem although it is definitely lacking in many organizations Trout added I think many bank CEOs encourage fiefdoms and internal rivalries especially between retail and wealth management as a way to cement their power and control Sievers said his firm has already convinced some institutions to adopt the new offerings Boston s Radius Bank will add the Goalkeeper and Signals products to its platform in the fall Harvest which also announced an additional million in equity and debt financing on Wednesday offers account automation and customer onboarding technology to banks and counts John Hancock Bank of Oklahoma First Citizens Bank and Apex Clearing Corp among its current clients Sievers said his company has added five new bank clients and should total active bank clients by year end Customers think of money in terms of savings and wealth he said It s not enough for the bank to just keep their balances They have got to understand how they interrelate",0

Regulatory Documents,Regulatory Documents SUMMARY The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection the Bureau is proposing to amend Regulation X which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of RESPA and the official interpretation of the regulation The proposed amendments implement the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Dodd Frank Act provisions regarding mortgage loan servicing Specifically this proposal requests comment regarding proposed additions to Regulation X to address seven servicer obligations To correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers to provide information requested by mortgage loan borrowers to ensure that a reasonable basis exists to obtain force placed insurance to establish reasonable information management policies and procedures to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers to provide delinquent borrowers access to servicer personnel with continuity of contact about the borrower s mortgage loan account and to evaluate borrowers applications for available loss mitigation options This proposal would also modify and streamline certain existing servicing related provisions of Regulation X For instance the proposal would revise provisions relating to a mortgage servicer s obligation to provide disclosures to borrowers in connection with a transfer of mortgage servicing and a mortgage servicer s obligation to manage escrow accounts including the obligation to advance funds to an escrow account to maintain insurance coverage and to return amounts in an escrow account to a borrower upon payment in full of a mortgage loan Published elsewhere in today s Federal Register the Bureau proposes companion regulations implementing amendments to the Truth In Lending Act TILA in Regulation Z the TILA Servicing Proposal EFFECTIVE DATE Comments must be received on or before October except that comments on the Paperwork Reduction Act analysis in part IX of

Rulemaking Initiative The Bureau is working with the Cornell e Rulemaking Initiative CeRI on a pilot project Regulation Room to use different web technologies and approaches to enhance public understanding and participation in Bureau rulemakings and to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of these techniques The TILA and RESPA proposed rulemakings on mortgage servicing are the subject of the project The Bureau has undertaken this project to increase effective public involvement in the rulemaking process and strongly encourages all parties interested in this rulemaking to visit the Regulation Room Web site http www regulationroom org to learn about the Bureau s proposed mortgage servicing rules and the rulemaking process to discuss the issues in the rules with other persons and groups and to participate in drafting a summary of that discussion that CeRI will submit to the Bureau Note that Regulation Room is sponsored by CeRI and is not an official United States Government Web site Participating in the discussion on that site will not result in individual formal comments that will be included in the Bureau s rulemaking record If you would like to add a formal comment please do so through the means identified above The Bureau anticipates that CeRI will submit to the Bureau s rulemaking docket a summary of the discussion that occurs on the Regulation Room site and that participants will have a chance to review a draft and suggest changes before the summary is submitted For questions about this project please contact Whitney Patross Attorney Office of Regulations at FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT Regulation X RESPA Jane Gao Mitchell E Hochberg and Michael Scherzer Counsels at Office of Regulations Division of Research Markets and Regulations Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection G Street NW Washington DC Regulation Z TILA Whitney Patross Attorney and Marta Tanenhaus Senior Counsel at Office of Regulations Division of Research Markets and Regulations Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection G Street NW Washington DC SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION I Overview A Background The recent financial crisis exposed pervasive consumer protection problems across major segments of the mortgage servicing industry As millions of borrowers fell behind on their loans many servicers failed to provide the level of service necessary to serve the needs of those borrowers Many servicers simply had not made the investments in resources and infrastructure necessary to service large numbers of delinquent loans Existing weaknesses in servicer practices including inadequate recordkeeping and document management and lack of oversight of service providers made it harder to sort out borrower problems to achieve optimal results In addition many servicers took short cuts that made things even worse As one review of fourteen major servicers found companies emphasize d speed and cost efficiency over quality and accuracy in their foreclosure processes FOOTNOTE Federal Reserve System Office of the Comptroller of the Currency Office of Thrift Supervision Interagency Review of Foreclosure Policies and Practices at Apr Interagency Foreclosure Report available at http www occ gov news issuances news releases nr occ a pdf END FOOTNOTE The Dodd Frank Act Pub L July adopts several new servicing protections The Bureau has the authority to promulgate regulations to implement the new servicing protections These changes will significantly improve disclosures to make it easier for consumers to monitor their mortgage loans and servicers activities The changes also address critical servicer practices including error resolution prompt crediting of payments and force placing insurance where borrowers have allowed their hazard insurance policies to lapse FOOTNOTE See Dodd Frank Act sections and END FOOTNOTE The Dodd Frank Act also gives the Bureau discretionary authority to develop additional servicing rules The Bureau proposes to use this authority to adopt requirements relating to reasonable information management policies and procedures early intervention with delinquent borrowers continuity of contact and procedures for evaluating and responding to loss mitigation applications when the servicer makes loss mitigation options available in the ordinary course of business These proposals address fundamental problems that underlie many consumer complaints and recent regulatory and enforcement actions The Bureau believes these changes will reduce avoidable foreclosures and improve general customer service The proposals cover nine major topics as summarized below The Bureau s proposal is split into two parts because Congress imposed some requirements under TILA and some under RESPA This proposed rule would amend Regulation X which implements RESPA to implement section of the Dodd Frank Act concerning error resolution and force placed insurance and to impose additional requirements concerning reasonable information management policies and procedures early intervention with delinquent borrowers continuity of contact and procedures for evaluating and responding to loss mitigation applications FOOTNOTE Note that TILA and RESPA differ in their terminology Consumers and creditors are the defined terms used in Regulation Z Borrowers and lenders are the defined terms used in Regulation X END FOOTNOTE B Scope of Coverage The proposed rules generally apply to closed end mortgage loans with certain exceptions Under the proposed amendments to Regulation X open end lines of credit and certain other loans such as construction loans and business purpose loans are excluded Under the proposed amendments to Regulation Z the periodic statement and adjustable rate mortgage ARM disclosure provisions apply only to closed end mortgage loans but the prompt crediting and payoff statement provisions apply both to open end and closed end mortgage loans In addition reverse mortgages and timeshares are excluded from the periodic statement requirement and certain construction loans are excluded from the ARM disclosure requirements As discussed below the Bureau is seeking comment on whether to exempt small servicers from certain requirements or modify certain requirements for small servicers C Summary This is a summary of a Federal Register article originally published on the page number listed below

Then Martin McGuinness one of those who directed the IRA war said the bombing of Claudy in was indefensible And now we have these comments on the Shankill bomb But will the story end with Thomas Begley and Sean Kelly and their parts in that bombing mission Or will the truth go deeper Who planned that attack with a bomb on a short fuse Will the IRA accept that even if they had been able to target loyalist leaders that day it was inevitable that civilians would also be killed And who in the developing peace will speak for the IRA leadership of Will individuals accept responsibility or will a process of truth be left to organisational statements What republicans are prepared to offer will depend on the contributions and responses of others Yesterday Declan Kearney said We believe truth recovery needs to be comprehensively discussed and a society wide consensus involving both governments agreed on how to proceed Many sides have buried their secrets of war And if one side is being asked to answer then so too will all sides republican loyalist security intelligence and politicians and governments In this debate the language is changing but a process has not yet been designed within which the hardest questions can be asked by all sides of every side and at the same time",0

approved or disapproved these securities or passed upon the adequacy of this prospectus Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense Before you invest you may want to review the fund s prospectus which contains more information about the fund and its risks You can find the fund s prospectus shareholder reports and other information about the fund online at troweprice com prospectus You can also get this information at no cost by calling by sending an e mail request to info troweprice com or by contacting your financial intermediary This Summary Prospectus incorporates by reference the fund s prospectus dated October as amended or supplemented and Statement of Additional Information dated October as amended or supplemented SUMMARY Investment Objective s The fund seeks the highest total return over time consistent with an emphasis on both capital growth and income Fees and Expenses This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you buy hold and sell shares of the fund You may also incur brokerage commissions and other charges when buying or selling shares of the fund which are not reflected in the table or example below Fees and Expenses of the Fund InvestorClass IClass Shareholder fees fees paid directly from your investment Maximum account fee a Annual fund operating expenses expenses that you pay each year as apercentage of the value of your investment Management fees b Other expenses Total annual fund operating expenses b a Subject to certain exceptions accounts with a balance of less than are charged an annual fee b Restated to reflect current fees Example This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds The example assumes that you invest in the fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods that your investment has a return each year and that the fund s operating expenses remain the same Although your actual costs may be higher or lower based on these assumptions your costs would be Year Years Years Years Investor Class I Class Portfolio Turnover The fund pays transaction costs such as commissions when it buys and sells securities or turns over its portfolio A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when the fund s shares are held in a taxable account These costs which are not reflected in annual fund operating expenses or in the example affect the fund s performance During the most recent fiscal period the fund s portfolio turnover rate was of the average value of its portfolio Investments Risks and Performance Principal Investment Strategies The fund pursues its objective s by investing in a diversified portfolio of other T Rowe Price stock and bond mutual funds that represent various asset classes and sectors The fund s T ROWE PRICE allocation among T Rowe Price mutual funds will change over time in relation to its target retirement date The fund invests in a mix of both actively managed funds and passively managed index funds which is an approach designed to reduce tracking error and result in lower overall fees in comparison to actively managed target date funds The fund is managed based on the specific retirement year target date included in its name and assumes a retirement age of The target date refers to the approximate year an investor in the fund would plan to retire and likely stop making new investments in the fund The fund is designed for an investor who retired at or about the target date and who plans to withdraw the value of the account in the fund gradually after retirement However if an investor retires earlier or later than age the fund may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor retires on or near the fund s target date Over time the allocation to asset classes and funds will change according to a predetermined glide path shown in the following chart the left axis indicates the overall neutral allocation to stocks with the remainder of the allocation to bonds The glide path represents the shifting of asset classes over time and shows how the fund s asset mix becomes more conservative both prior to and after retirement as time elapses This reflects the need for reduced market risks as retirement approaches and the need for lower portfolio volatility after retiring Although the glide path is meant to dampen the fund s potential volatility as retirement approaches the fund is not designed for a lump sum redemption at the retirement date The fund pursues an asset allocation strategy that promotes asset accumulation prior to retirement but it is intended to also serve as a post retirement investment vehicle with allocations designed to support an income stream made up of regular withdrawals throughout retirement along with some portfolio growth that exceeds inflation After the target date the fund is designed to balance longevity and inflation risks along with the need for some income although it does not guarantee a particular level of income SUMMARY The glide path provides for a neutral allocation to stocks at the target date of The fund s overall exposure to stocks will continue to decline until approximately years after its target date when its neutral allocations to stocks and bonds will remain unchanged There are no maturity restrictions within the fund s overall allocation to bonds although the bond funds in which the fund invests may impose specific limits on maturity or credit quality The allocations are referred to as neutral allocations because they are strategic and do not reflect any tactical decisions made by T Rowe Price to overweight or underweight a particular asset class or sector based on its market outlook The target allocations assigned to the broad asset classes Stocks and Bonds which reflect these tactical decisions resulting from market outlook are not expected to vary from the neutral allocations set forth in the glide path by more than plus or minus five percent The target allocations and actual allocations may differ due to significant market movements or cash flows The following table illustrates how the portfolio is generally expected to be allocated between the asset classes and the underlying T Rowe Price mutual funds that are used to represent the broad asset classes and specific sectors The fund invests in the Z Class of each of its underlying funds T Rowe Price is contractually obligated to waive and or bear all of the Z Class expenses with certain limited exceptions The fund s overall allocation to stocks is represented by a diversified mix of U S and international stock funds that employ both growth and value investment approaches and consist of large cap mid cap and small cap stocks The fund s overall allocation to bonds is represented by a core fixed income component designed to have lower overall volatility and a diversifying fixed income component designed to respond to a variety of market conditions and improve risk adjusted returns The information in the table represents the neutral allocations for the fund as of October The fund s shareholder reports set forth its actual allocations between stock funds and bond funds and to the individual T Rowe Price mutual funds T Rowe Price may periodically rebalance or modify the

objective s The fund s share price fluctuates which means you could lose money by investing in the fund You may experience losses including losses near at or after the target retirement date There is no guarantee that the fund will provide adequate income at and through your retirement The principal risks of investing in this fund which may be even greater in bad or uncertain market conditions are summarized as follows Active management Asset allocation The fund s overall level of risk will directly correspond to the risks of the underlying funds in which it invests By investing in many underlying funds the fund has partial exposure to the risks of different areas of the market However the selection of the underlying funds and the allocation of the fund s assets among the various asset classes market sectors and investment styles represented by those underlying funds could cause the fund to underperform other funds with a similar benchmark or investment objective s SUMMARY Investments in other funds The fund bears the risk that its underlying funds will fail to successfully employ their investment strategies One or more underlying fund s underperformance or failure to meet its investment objective s as intended could cause the fund to underperform similarly managed funds Market conditions The value of the fund s investments may decrease sometimes rapidly or unexpectedly due to factors affecting an issuer held by an underlying fund particular industries or the overall securities markets A variety of factors can increase the volatility of an underlying fund s holdings and markets generally including political or regulatory developments recessions inflation rapid interest rate changes war military conflict or acts of terrorism natural disasters and outbreaks of infectious illnesses or other widespread public health issues such as the coronavirus pandemic and related governmental and public responses including sanctions Certain events may cause instability across global markets including reduced liquidity and disruptions in trading markets while some events may affect certain geographic regions countries sectors and industries more significantly than others Government intervention in markets may impact interest rates market volatility and security pricing These adverse developments may cause broad declines in market value due to short term market movements or for significantly longer periods during more prolonged market downturns Bond exposure An underlying bond fund s share price can fall because of various factors affecting bonds or due to general weakness in the overall bond markets The fund invests in underlying funds with varying levels of credit risk interest rate risk inflation risk and liquidity risk At times participants in bond markets may develop concerns about the ability of certain issuers to make timely principal and interest payments or they may develop concerns about the ability of financial institutions that make markets in certain debt instruments to facilitate an orderly market Those concerns could cause increased volatility and reduced liquidity in particular securities or in the overall bond markets and the related derivatives markets which could hamper an underlying fund s ability to sell the bonds in which it invests or to find and purchase suitable investments Stock exposure An underlying stock fund s share price can fall because of weakness in the overall stock markets a particular industry or specific holdings Stocks generally fluctuate in value more than bonds and may decline significantly over short time periods There is a chance that stock prices overall will decline because stock markets tend to move in cycles with periods of rising and falling prices The value of an underlying stock fund may decline due to general weakness or volatility in the stock markets adverse conditions impacting a particular industry or market sector or factors affecting an investment style or market capitalization targeted by the fund International investing Investing in underlying funds that hold the securities of non U S issuers involves special risks not typically associated with investing in underlying funds that hold securities of U S issuers Non U S securities tend to be more volatile and have lower overall liquidity than investments in U S securities and may lose value because of adverse local political social or economic developments overseas or due to changes in the exchange rates between foreign currencies and the U S dollar In addition investments outside the U S are T ROWE PRICE subject to settlement practices and regulatory and financial reporting standards that differ from those of the U S The risks of investing outside the U S are heightened for any investments in emerging markets which are susceptible to greater volatility than investments in developed markets Emerging markets Investing in underlying funds that hold securities of issuers in emerging market countries involves greater risk and overall volatility than investing in underlying funds that hold securities of issuers in the U S and other developed markets Emerging market countries tend to have economic structures that are less diverse and mature less developed legal and regulatory regimes and political systems that are less stable than those of developed countries In addition to the risks normally associated with investing outside the U S emerging markets are more susceptible to governmental interference political and economic uncertainty local taxes and restrictions on an underlying fund s investments less efficient trading markets with lower overall liquidity and more volatile currency exchange rates Interest rates The prices of and the income generated by bonds and other debt instruments held by an underlying fund may be affected by changes in interest rates A rise in interest rates typically causes the price of a fixed rate debt instrument to fall and its yield to rise Conversely a decline in interest rates typically causes the price of a fixed rate debt instrument to rise and the yield to fall The prices and yields of inflation linked bonds are directly impacted by the rate of inflation as well as changes in interest rates Generally underlying bond funds with longer weighted average maturities and durations carry greater interest rate risk Changes in monetary policy made by central banks and or governments such as the discontinuation and replacement of benchmark rates are likely to affect the interest rates or yields of securities in which an underlying fund invests Prepayments and extensions Underlying funds that invest in mortgage backed securities other asset backed securities or any debt instrument with an embedded call option are subject to prepayment risks because the principal on the security may be prepaid at any time which could reduce the security s yield and market value The rate of prepayments tends to increase as interest rates fall which could cause the average maturity of the underlying fund s portfolio to shorten Extension risk may result from a rise in interest rates which tends to make mortgage backed securities asset backed securities and other callable debt instruments more volatile Credit quality An issuer of a debt instrument held by an underlying fund could suffer an adverse change in financial condition that results in a payment default failure to make scheduled interest or principal payments rating downgrade or inability to meet a financial obligation The fund s exposure to credit risk is increased to the extent the fund invests in underlying funds that hold securities that are not considered investment grade Holdings that are rated below investment grade carry greater risk of default and erratic price swings due in part to potentially adverse changes in the credit quality of the issuer Market capitalization Because the fund invests in certain underlying funds that focus on a particular market capitalization its share price may be negatively affected if investing in that market capitalization falls out of favor Small and mid cap companies often have less experienced management more limited financial resources and less publicly available SUMMARY information than large cap companies and tend to be more sensitive to changes in overall economic conditions As a result investments in small cap and mid cap companies are likely to be more volatile than investments in large cap companies However large cap companies may not be able to attain the high growth rates of successful smaller companies especially during strong economic periods and they may be less capable of responding quickly to competitive challenges and industry changes Investment style Because the fund invests in certain underlying funds that focus on growth stocks and certain underlying funds that focus on value stocks its share price may be negatively affected if either investing approach falls out of favor Growth stocks tend to be more volatile than the overall stock market and are more sensitive to changes in current or expected earnings Value stocks carry the risk that investors will not recognize their intrinsic value for a long time or at all or that they are actually appropriately priced at a low level Inflation To the extent the fund invests in underlying funds that are designed to provide protection against the impact of inflation those investments could adversely affect the fund s performance when inflation or expectations of inflation are low During such periods the values of an underlying fund s investments in inflation linked securities or stocks designed to outperform the overall stock market during periods of high or rising inflation could fall and result in losses for the fund causing the fund to lag the performance of similarly managed funds Liquidity An underlying fund may not be able to meet requests to redeem shares without significant dilution of the remaining shareholders interests in the fund A particular investment or an entire market segment may become less liquid or even illiquid sometimes abruptly which could limit a fund s ability to purchase or sell holdings in a timely manner at a desired price Reduced liquidity can result from a number of events such as limited trading activity reductions in bond inventory and rapid or unexpected changes in interest rates Large redemptions may also have a negative impact on an underlying fund s overall liquidity Bank loans Underlying funds that invest in bank loans expose the fund to additional risks beyond those normally associated with more traditional debt instruments An underlying fund s ability to receive payments in connection with a loan depends primarily on the financial condition of the borrower and whether or not a loan is secured by collateral although there is no assurance that the collateral securing a loan will be sufficient to satisfy the loan obligation In addition bank loans often have contractual restrictions on resale which can delay the sale and adversely impact the sale price and they have significantly longer settlement periods than more traditional investments Bank loans often involve borrowers whose financial condition is troubled or highly leveraged which increases an underlying fund s risk that the fund may not receive its proceeds in a timely manner or that the fund may incur losses in order to pay redemption proceeds to its shareholders Since floating interest rates on bank loans are typically based on a percentage above LIBOR London Interbank Offered Rate the expected discontinuation in for the majority of the LIBOR rates could adversely impact the performance of underlying funds that hold bank loans T ROWE PRICE Cybersecurity breaches The fund could be harmed by intentional cyberattacks and other cybersecurity breaches including unauthorized access to the fund s assets customer data and

By law, a fiduciaryÃ¢â‚¬â€like a doctor or a lawyerÃ¢â‚¬â€must act in the best interests of his client and seek to avoid all material conflicts of interest. Investment advisers are required to act as fiduciaries, but stockbrokers and insurance agents generally aren'tÃ¢â‚¬â€yet. As early as October the U S Department of Labor is expected to propose new rules that would ensure that brokers and other securities professionals would act solely for the benefit of their clients when advising on individual retirement accounts Those assets are a giant honey pot with trillion in IRAs according to the Federal Reserve The Dodd Frank financial regulation law of authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish a no less stringent fiduciary standard for brokers than the duties that investment advisers must follow How that will play out may depend largely on the ferocious lobbying battle raging over the Labor Department s plan The period for public comment on what an SEC rule should look like officially ended in July The SEC staff a spokesman says is carefully considering the comments we received and will coordinate with the commissioners on next steps The SEC won t say how long that might take Meanwhile the Labor Department is charging full speed ahead and raising hackles in the brokerage industry The DOL is clearly moving forward on a track that s inconsistent with where the policy should end up Judd Gregg the former Republican U S Senator from New Hampshire who serves as chief executive of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association Wall Street s main trade group told me It s a dangerously large expansion that will chill all kinds of activity Mr Gregg says it would be a disaster a nightmare if the DOL sets a separate fiduciary standard for IRAs We don t think the DOL is moving forward in a way that s going to be constructive at all it s going to be destructive adds Mr Gregg The folks with small accounts are going to lose the ability to get advice and their costs will go up The heart of the matter Fiduciaries should avoid conflicts but brokers are generally required only to disclose them Having a completely conflict free relationship doesn t work in practice across most of the brokerage industry says John Taft head of RBC Wealth Management in the U S which manages billion For example when your broker s firm underwrites an initial public offering of stock he and the firm earn far more by selling some of those shares to you than selling you something else When your broker buys you a bond out of his firm s inventory of your broker s firm rather than on the open market the firm also tends to make more money Industry groups have argued that if brokers can t have any conflicts like earning higher fees on some investments than on others then they no longer will be able to afford handling small accounts The brokerage industry is saying in effect If you don t allow us to continue to give conflicted advice we won t be able to give any Assistant Secretary of Labor Phyllis Borzi who oversees retirement benefits told me But there are lots of people out there who are already acting as fiduciaries and they re not bankrupt They re making money Labor Department officials can t comment on the details of the pending rule proposal but Ms Borzi says the agency and the SEC are working very closely to ensure that their agendas don t clash There are several possibilities say legal experts Advisers could be restricted from enticing retirees to sell one investment they already hold in order to buy another says Tamar Frankel a professor at Boston University who specializes in fiduciary law Arthur Laby a securities law professor at Rutgers University suggests that brokers could be permitted to fill orders for individual investors from their firms own inventory only for readily marketable highly liquid securities and that firms could be prevented from paying their advisers more for selling in house products There s no mileage in it for anybody to come up with a rule that is unduly burdensome Ms Borzi says But when people rely on experts for advice on what is probably the biggest chunk of money they ve ever had in their life the advisers have a responsibility to work for the clients best interests and not their own Meanwhile ask your adviser Do you or your firm earn more money for recommending this investment Can you suggest a simpler cheaper way of accomplishing the same goal Investors can always act as their own fiduciaries just in case their advisers aren t Write to Jason Zweig at intelligentinvestor wsj com",0
#NAME?,#NAME? Brings investors equity upside while trying to limit downside By Thomas Gryta The Invesco Convertible Securities fund CNSAX seeks to harness perhaps the best aspect of convertible bonds let investors benefit from rising equity prices while reducing downside risk when they drop A convertible is a hybrid investment instrument a corporate bond with the option of being converted into a pre determined number of common shares at certain price That allows it to trade like a stock as equity value rises but a floor is provided by the coupon payments and return of the principal at maturity It is a defensive approach to equities said Ellen Gold lead manager of the fund The fund is up for the year as of Monday about percentage points above the Morningstar category average for open end convertible funds In the last three and five years the fund s average annual total returns were and respectively topping the category by percentage points and percentage points Depending on market factors a convertible can be more sensitive to either the price of underlying equity or to the price of the bond Morningstar mutual fund analyst Michelle Canavan specializes in convertible funds there are only about and said the Invesco fund has been particularly good at adjusting its portfolio to the wider environment of the markets and economy This allowed the fund to limit the damage of the financial crisis in but benefit from the upswing in later years Overall she said convertible funds can play a role in an investors portfolio It can be a good diversifier in this environment but it will be riskier than your typical fixed income fund Ms Canavan said The Invesco fund typically looks for convertible securities that offer to of the upside from the underlying equity but with only to of the downside Ms Gold said Once it finds issues that match the profile the fund conducts traditional equity analysis on the company and its stock Because it is a bond the fund must factor in credit risk to some degree even though many convertible issues aren t rated by credit rating agencies If we don t like the underlying common stock chances are we aren t going to buy the convertible she said The fund invests in some busted convertibles which are those that have fallen enough below their conversion price that they are likely to be converted and thus trade more like a bond The credit of the company has deteriorated but not to the point of being distressed Ms Gold said It owns busted convertibles in several financial services companies as part of its top holdings including Bank of America Corp BAC and Wells Fargo Co WFC notes co manager Ramez Nashed The fund only invests in true convertibles as opposed to synthetic convertibles that are typically constructed through a mix of investment grade bonds and long term options on a particular stock Turnover of the fund s holdings varies but has dropped in recent years because the number of new issues has fallen as companies opt to take advantage of low interest rates to issue traditional debt The total convertible market is about billion according to Ms Gold In terms of individual investments the fund likes Gilead Sciences Inc GILD which makes HIV medication drugs and is developing a new one pill treatment for Hepatitis C Ms Gold likes the reliability of the HIV treatment business while also having potentially significant growth opportunities from the success of the Hepatitis C treatment The Invesco fund holds Gilead s coupon convertible with a May maturity which currently has a yield It doesn t sound like a lot but the common stock doesn t pay a dividend she said The bond has a conversion premium the amount paid in excess of a similar traditional bond without conversion which she considers to be low She notes that the bond will benefit from a rising stock price and the short maturity timeline means it will behave like a traditional bond if the shares drop Ms Gold also likes network equipment maker Ciena Corp CIEN because it should benefit from AT T Inc s T recent announcement to increase its capital spending on its wireless and landline networks AT T has typically been Ciena s largest customers Ms Gold said The fund owns Ciena s coupon convertible with a March maturity and a current yield She expects the benefits of AT T s investment may take some time to materialize but should boost the stock If you are wrong you are getting par back but in the meantime you re getting a coupon for the next three years she said Thomas Gryta covers the U S telecom industry for Dow Jones He can be reached at or

MoneyTips,MoneyTips You ve made some life decisions that you ve regretted and some of those decisions surely involve money What sort of money mistakes have you made Don t be shy about admitting your financial mistakes According to the latest version of Finder com s annual America s Biggest Money Mistakes survey you have million fellow Americans to keep you company More than three quarters of respondents claimed to have made a money mistake in their lifetime We re surprised that number isn t closer to As Finder com Consumer Advocate Jennifer McDermott says It s understandable that so many have made a money mistake in our lifetime we re only human However while a slip up doesn t need to derail our entire financial wellbeing it s important to recognize the triggers to make better choices in the future What s the most cited financial mistake By far the winner was spending too much money on fun activities such as shopping vacations or dining out Almost of respondents claimed this financial error Blowing too much on fun is the number one money mistake Americans are making It s easy when you re swept up in the moment to only listen to what makes us feel good right there and then whether that s a new dress another drink or booking a last minute vacay empathizes McDermott However it s important to assess how you re likely to feel after spending that amount of money Will it still seem like a good idea when the credit card bill arrives Women were more likely to admit this overspending at compared to of men Are men more unwilling to admit financial mistakes in general Truth be told there was only a one percentage point difference between men and women who admitted past financial mistakes for women for men Even so there are some insightful differences in the types of mistake claimed more by either sex Along with overspending women were also more likely to regret letting their partner control the family finances to for men The categories where men had much greater regrets than women suggest tendencies for riskier behavior Almost one quarter of men surveyed regretted making a bad investment compared to only of women In addition of male respondents reported too much gambling as a fiscal error compared to only of female respondents Perhaps testosterone trumps proper risk assessment Men and women reported the second largest financial regret at about the same rate of women and of men regretted dropping out of college It s fair to call dropping out a financial regret based on data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS As of college dropouts earned a median wage of per week well below the median of for all workers Those with bachelor s degrees had a median weekly salary of Unemployment rates show a similar pattern for college dropouts for those with bachelor s degrees The number of people naming dropping out of college as a money mistake shows there s a need for greater discussion about career pathways For those yet to attend it s worth taking some time to research and determine your options before locking in your major suggests McDermott This may come in the form of a gap year or entering into the world of internships both of these can inform your decision and help you decide what industry is right There s no rush Doing this could save you a lot in the student debt you accumulate by dropping out without earning a degree The survey found some generational differences but perhaps not as much as you might expect Millennials and Generation X ers were almost equally likely to admit financial mistakes to respectively Baby boomers were least likely to admit a money mistake at a questionable number because baby boomers have had more time to make financial mistakes than the other generations Individual money mistakes were a bit more predictable along generational lines Millennials were far more likely to admit overspending on fun activities than generation X ers and baby boomers Baby Boomers were more likely to regret bad investments compared to generation X ers and millennials Other financial regrets include overpaying for a wedding getting caught in an online scam and having children It s odd to consider having children as a financial regret because we d like to think that your investment in a child isn t for financial payback Still the average cost of raising a child born in through the age of is estimated at over according to a report released by the U S Department of Agriculture and that value probably hasn t been decreasing So you ve made some mistakes with your money Who hasn t Outside of the nearly one quarter of respondents whom we believe simply won t admit it The real point is that you learn from those mistakes and don t repeat them If you continue to make money mistakes eventually you won t have any money left for future financial foul ups Don t add to your money regrets by ignoring your financial report card You can check your credit score and read your credit report for free within

"Nearly 2,300 teachers have just had a mountain of student loan debt lifted off their backs, according to previously unreleased figures from the U.S. Department of Education. The move follows reporting by NPR that exposed a nightmare for public school teachers across the country.

The move follows reporting by NPR that exposed a nightmare for public school teachers across the country.

In exchange for agreeing to work in low-income schools, aspiring teachers could get federal Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grants from the department to help pay their way through college. But those grants were often unfairly turned into loans that teachers had to pay back. In December the Education Department proposed a fix Now that fix has been expanded and thousands more teachers are likely to get help We ve put teachers who didn t deserve this stress this pressure this financial burden in a position that is frightening and confusing says Education Department acting undersecretary and acting assistant secretary Diane Auer Jones I can t give them back those years and I can t take away the gray hairs and I can t take away the stress It seems like a small thing to do to say I m sorry but I m very sorry And we want to work to fix it and correct it Kaitlyn McCollum is one of the teachers who lost her grant money unfairly and like many of them her story began with a letter that sent her reeling The mailbox Two years ago the high school teacher in Columbia Tenn walked to the mailbox pregnant with her first child and opened an official looking letter from the Education Department I remember going out to the mailbox I even opened it up at the mailbox and sheer panic just set in McCollum says Her federal TEACH Grants had been turned into more than in loans The reason McCollum had narrowly missed a deadline for mailing in some annual paperwork She walked inside sat at the family table beside her husband A J and sobbed Not only was this sudden crushing debt unfair McCollum later argued to the Education Department she couldn t afford to pay it on her meager teacher s salary And she didn t understand why the department wouldn t turn the loans back into grants since she could prove she was teaching just as she d promised She appealed but was told her loans could not possibly be turned back into grants McCollum was not alone NPR s reporting over the past year found that the same thing was happening to thousands of other public school teachers The problem at the heart of the TEACH Grant story is that small paperwork issues often triggered this catastrophic consequence In order to qualify for a grant aspiring teachers agreed to teach for four years in a low income public school But the rules also required that teachers send in a form every year to prove they were actually teaching The forms were often due over the summer when teachers and principals who had to sign them were away on vacation And if teachers sent in this annual form even one day late missing a signature or date or with any other little problem their TEACH Grants would be turned into loans with interest And this process was irreversible Teachers were told their loans could not be converted back to grants For two years the debt haunted McCollum and her young family They went into forbearance a brief reprieve but with interest accruing They even moved to a smaller less expensive house to prepare for what now seemed inevitable No one was listening Fair or not the debt was growing and would need to be repaid And then just a few Saturdays ago another letter arrived in the mail McCollum opened it in the car her husband driving their young son Louther chirping in the back seat A much needed spring break vacation lay ahead Do you see that word Congratulations McCollum said smiled and laughed It was official That debt now had finally been turned back into grants You re free baby her husband A J said Two years of us fighting this McCollum said We won she tells NPR We raised our voices and they finally heard us Disbelief followed by a relief like I have not felt before The scale of the problem and the fix The federal TEACH Grant program was created in with the best of intentions to help aspiring teachers who committed to teach high need subjects in low income schools pay for college And the program succeeded in attracting bright young teachers to work in some of the nation s most underserved schools According to the most recent data roughly teachers have successfully completed the program s four year teaching requirement But that compares to recipients who have had their grants turned into loans Many of those conversions were justified young students who later decided teaching was not for them and didn t complete their required service But many others were undoubtedly like Kaitlyn McCollum They have taught as promised but were trapped in the program s administrative quicksand In December after multiple NPR reports on the depth of the TEACH Grant problem the Education Department announced it would offer relief for any teacher who could prove they had fulfilled or could still fulfill their teaching service Grants that had unfairly become loans because of these minor paperwork problems would at last become grants again The irreversible became reversible From internal reports from the work that NPR did it was abundantly clear to us that there was a problem with TEACH Grants says the Education Department s Jones who served in the same role in when the TEACH rules were first written We realized that there were certain things that seemed like a good idea when we wrote the regulation but they were just too cumbersome for students And unfairly so The number of teachers getting help is likely to rise According to the department since it rolled out its fix in January nearly teachers have applied for relief So far nearly have been approved for the fix and are getting their loans turned back into grants and fewer than teachers have been denied In short the vast majority of teachers who apply for the fix are getting their grants back Expanding the fix In addition to the department s current relief efforts advocates have also pushed for an overhaul of the TEACH Grant s rules That process known as negotiated rulemaking recently concluded with something of a surprise The department agreed to expand its fix to reach even more teachers and to make the program much easier to navigate Once these new rules go into effect TEACH Grants can no longer be turned into loans just because of late or incomplete annual paperwork So that draconian penalty for such a small infraction will disappear The department is also committing to help teachers who had their credit hurt when they defaulted on these loans But hanging over this process has been one thorny question what to do about teachers who lost their grants and as a result decided to change schools or quit teaching altogether In other words they lost their grants were told there was nothing they could do and so they moved on with their lives On the phone honestly I cried at one point Because I was like this isn t right You know it s not fair remembers Victoria Libsack who taught for three years in a low income Phoenix school But after she narrowly missed a paperwork deadline and her grants were converted to loans Libsack eventually moved to a different state and took a job at a school that doesn t meet TEACH requirements The problem for Libsack and teachers like her is that the program requires four years of teaching within an eight year window Even with the department s initial fix Libsack would have very little time to quit her current job potentially move again and find a new job in a qualifying school to complete her required service And some teachers have no time left at all In February Libsack flew to Washington D C to share her story with the government committee that has been tasked with rewriting the rules Living on a teacher s salary at a low income school I had just enough to live Libsack told the committee I loved teaching but I felt overwhelmed and defeated when my TEACH Grant was converted That rules committee heard Libsack and voted to expand the department s fix to include teachers like her They agreed to go back and pause the eight year clock at the time when a teacher s grants were first converted For Libsack that means she should now have five more years to complete her final year of service She ll still need to change schools to qualify That s not ideal she says but it will mean she won t have to pay upward of in loans Libsack says she s now feeling hopeful because her government finally listened For me as a teacher it s awesome she says because then I can convey that to the students and say Hey you do have a voice You are citizens You do have a role in our government The department s fix has not been entirely smooth Many teachers have told NPR that some call center staff seemed unfamiliar with the new rules and that the paperwork they were sent even after they got approved was really confusing Some advocates argue the department should do even more for teachers like Libsack Patrick Llewellyn an attorney at Public Citizen Litigation Group says the government should be more flexible with teachers who lost their grants unfairly many years ago He says it should reduce the number of years they re required to teach in order to satisfy the program s requirements and keep their grants For people who were converted eight nine years ago it is a lot to ask of them to quit their current job and find another one if they are doing something completely different Llewellyn says especially since they are in this position because of how the program has been mishandled But on this point the department is holding firm with the original terms of the deal Teachers have to teach for four years Perhaps the biggest challenge remaining for the Education Department is one of outreach and communication There is relief available for teachers says Llewellyn but they need to know about it Some teachers who were hit with these unfair debts still may not realize they qualify to have them forgiven or refunded if they ve already paid them Many have changed addresses both physical and email and may be difficult to find The department says it is reaching out to make sure those who need the help know that it s finally there It also encourages any teachers who think they might qualify to proactively ask for help Copyright NPR To see more visit https www npr org",0

We have seen three characteristics emerge from this crisis the early retirees the retirement delayers and the newly motivated pension planners said Rosie Hooper chartered financial planner at asset manager Quilter Plc This pandemic has just accelerated things whether out of necessity or desire In the first few months of the pandemic last year investors were hit hard by a collapse in financial markets Massive government stimulus however has lifted sentiment since then While some have used the money for big ticket purchases like cars and homes others are salting it away A survey by the country s statistics office ONS showed that one in eight workers or of people aged years and over said they had changed their retirement plans with saying that they will retire earlier and planning to retire later In any case people are now talking more about their retirement plans wealth managers said There are signs it s helping people make up their mind said Sarah Coles personal finance analyst at Hargreaves which manages million clients LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND The crisis has also upended priorities some want to spend more time on pet projects or with family as many continue to work from home despite vaccination drives and as companies cut real estate footprint For some people it has opened their eyes to the compromises their working life has forced on them so they re keen to leave it all behind as soon as possible Coles said Tom Selby senior analyst at AJ Bell which has customers said new customers at its investment platform surged by nearly two thirds in the first three months of this year from a year earlier A majority of them invested for the long term via savings accounts and pensions Overall funds under management in the UK reached a record trillion pounds at the end of while inflows tripled to billion pounds data https www theia org media press releases ps bn inflows active funds december second highest inflows record from Britain s investment industry trade body Investment Association showed Everyone will know someone that very sadly has passed away as a result of COVID that will make people consider their life plan their life goals when do they want to retire said Andrew Croft CEO of blue chip asset manager St James s Place People will be considering that a lot more If you reach a conclusion that maybe I want to retire earlier than I originally planned what you are going to do is you are going to find your way to a financial planner Croft however added it was too early to call this a trend It could be that in months time everyone has forgotten it and they have moved on That s why I think it has got some way to play out Reporting by Muvija M in Bengaluru Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty",0

The 62-year-old, who studied music as well as philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford, has spent the past decade in charge of investment at the UK's largest pension fund, the Ã‚Â£67bn Universities Superannuation Scheme. He announced in February that he would retire, a decision that took effect at the end of last month. One could forgive Gray for wanting a little downtime It has not been a small job His tenure has been marked by the aftermath of the financial crisis the eurozone s near meltdown ballooning liabilities and years of sound and fury over cuts to academics pensions At the same time USS has more than doubled its investment staff shifted billions out of stocks and begun snapping up direct ownership stakes in national trophy assets like Heathrow Airport and Thames Water the country s largest water utility Against a fraught backdrop USS s investments have performed well Over the years to March the scheme has returned almost a year on average net of all costs in comparison with a target of a year We have had a pretty good run is how Gray sums up his team s performance It is a typical answer Temperamentally Gray is extremely zen With an ever present genial smile he seems to analyse questions from every angle before replying It has been a busy decade Unlike many the fund manages most of its money in house and the number of investment staff has gone from to It has added new capabilities in credit and emerging markets and formed a specialist strategy team But it is in off market private or alternative investments that Gray leaves his most transformational legacy Pension funds elevated appetite for these assets usually purchased through private equity and infrastructure funds is well known But USS has been at the forefront of UK funds bid to emulate the Canadian model named after the DIY approach pioneered by several of the country s large pension funds Like them USS operates in private markets on more equal terms with the likes of KKR and Blackstone either by investing alongside private equity companies or seeking to source and buy assets for themselves Gray does not pretend this has been easy He says We have gone up a learning curve Take the way people acquire assets in private markets There are quite a lot of assets that come up in auction processes and we have been singularly unsuccessful in auction processes because there is always someone who is willing to pay more than we are Instead USS has had to spend time and money on creating its own deal sourcing team people who have the contacts to bring in deals ahead of the competition The private markets group is quite lawyer intensive Gray observes All of this presumably comes at a price but the scheme says its investment costs amount to of its assets down from in USS s assets have also grown substantially from bn to bn during Gray s tenure That can support a few extra lawyers Critics of USS s investment approach and as the UK s largest pension fund it has many say the scheme is overly cautious They claim it took too long to shift money out of equities and into the bond heavy liability matching strategies adopted by most of the private sector and the result is a bn deficit and cuts in the offing for academics pensions The scheme does have around of its assets today in liability matching index linked gilts and another in lower risk bonds and credit Gray also says the scheme s return has outpaced the a year growth of a model portfolio meant to track its liabilities stating If we had put it all in gilts that is roughly what we would have got But most of the fiery debate around USS is not quite in Gray s remit Pension liabilities have been blown out to tremendous proportions chiefly by two things the fact that we are all living longer and the slump in long term interest rates and bond yields Most defined benefit pensions in the private sector have responded simply by closing their doors In university bosses said they would like to do the same but their scheme is jointly run by university employers and unions and the latter are fiercely opposed Who should pay up to close the scheme s deficit academics or universities is an increasingly bitter wrangle Academics walked out on strike in February and unions have threatened further action this autumn Investing in private assets particularly infrastructure also comes with risk How comfortable is Gray with USS s stake in Thames Water acquired in given the UK opposition Labour Party s plans to nationalise the sector It does put some limit on how much of these regulated assets you want to own in the UK he concedes It had us scratching our heads more than it might have done several years ago I think it would be rather sad if large UK long term investors were deterred from investing in UK infrastructure READ Labour to fight nationalisation battles in court Gray can claim a job well done on diversifying the scheme s investments He joined with a brief to expand USS s alternatives portfolio from to and it is currently sitting around There is one notable exception Back in a key plank of USS s diversification strategy was to put at least of its money even then more than bn into hedge funds It has not worked out that way Gray says this is now less than even after efforts to secure more favourable terms We have done a number of things he says including negotiating the typical management and performance fee structure to somewhere around and respectively What is next for Roger Gray I ask I haven t really been entertaining any conversations about what to do next he muses I anticipate dividing my time There will be something that is food for my soul I think I will take up the oboe

"Pennsylvania's attempts to lure high-tech companies by offering big tax incentives have brought only marginal gains, according to a new study.

The state had a net gain of 43 high-tech employers between 1990 and 2006, but a net loss of 2,850 jobs, according to the study, funded by the Pittsburgh nonprofit Heinz Endowments and conducted by the Washington nonprofit Good Jobs First.

The Heinz Endowments focuses on improving southwestern Pennsylvania's economy and culture. Good Jobs First researches state and local jobs subsidies. The study contends that the job losses show the tax incentives aren t enough to offset other factors like globalization It said Pennsylvania s tax and incentive codes provided little appreciable advantage or disadvantage over states it competes with to draw high tech companies including Maryland New Jersey New York Ohio West Virginia and North Carolina Pennsylvania officials argued that several recent incentives created jobs in the state including an expansion project by Westinghouse Gary Tuma Gov Ed Rendell s press secretary said the state offered about million in incentives to Westinghouse Electric Co and the company in turn plans to invest million That s quite a strong return on our investment there Mr Tuma said Still he said the state whose incentives are worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year would use the study to see how we can maximize the return from our economic development investments and see if there are any policy adjustments that are warranted The study adds to the debate over the effectiveness of tax incentives such as training grants infrastructure improvements and sales tax exemptions on new equipment in creating jobs The issue has gained national attention recently as the Obama administration has considered a federal tax credit to boost employment Economists disagree on the usefulness of tax incentives with some saying they shouldn t be underestimated as a job creation tool Taxes can become a definitive incentive said Jim Diffley an economist with Global Insight in Philadelphia Mr Diffley says the primary factors companies look for in a location are the quality of the labor force and prevailing wage rates as well as the ease of transporting goods to market and traveling to the site But when a company has narrowed its choices to several states taxes can be the deciding factor he argues Richard Florida director of the Martin Prosperity Institute at the University of Toronto said he thinks competition among states has calmed down amid the recession because there is less to fight over He said that while many economic development policy makers want to use the same incentives as competing states many academics are finding that at best they don t work and at worst they re counterproductive and wasteful Many companies argue for the incentives Vaughn Gilbert a spokesman for Westinghouse said Without question the incentives were important I think Pennsylvania really stepped up to the plate and that s a big reason why we chose to stay here and expand here Jeff Finkle president and chief executive of the International Economic Development Council a Washington nonprofit that represents regional economic development groups said in the current economy business is in the driver seat and states are unlikely to drop incentives He said such incentives are important when a company is deciding between a few options He declined to comment on the study because he hadn t read it Daniel Wilson a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has studied tax credits aimed at spurring job creation in states from to the present We see this bump up in employment right after this credit comes into effect he said but that overall there was a zero sum across all states A big concern he says is that companies could game the system by firing workers before using a credit to rehire more workers or by switching workers to part time status before a credit takes effect But Mr Wilson said more states are adding measures to avoid those problems The Pennsylvania study found that more jobs were lost to other countries than to other states by a to ratio It also found that job creation is driven more by factors in the state such as expansion of pre existing companies than by interstate relocations Write to Kris Maher at kris maher wsj com",0

What kind of smartphone you have, who your friends are and how you answer survey questions may foretell how likely you are to pay back a loan.

Don't expect this alternative data to displace the three-digit number most lenders use, however. Credit scores still matter - a lot. Lenders use credit scores to decide whether you get loans and credit cards plus the rates you pay Scores are also used to determine which apartments you can rent which cellphone plans you can get and in most states how much you pay for auto and homeowners insurance The central problem with credit scores is that they can t be generated unless people actively use credit accounts Millions of people don t but they still may be creditworthy Alternative data is being used to sniff them out What may predict your risk of default Some U S lenders for example factor in how often people change addresses how they pay noncredit bills such as rent or cell phone plans and how they handle their bank accounts FICO the leading credit scoring company has found that people who have savings maintain higher balances in their checking accounts and don t overdraft may be good credit risks The company has created a new opt in score that would allow lenders with consumers permission to factor in bank account behavior when evaluating loan applications In Russia applicants can get loans based on answers to psychometric surveys that evaluate their verbal and arithmetical skills Meanwhile a study of a German e commerce company s transactions found people s digital footprints whether they use iPhones have numbers in their email addresses or shop at night can predict their risk of default If you re curious iPhone users are less likely to default than Android users while those who have email numbers or shop late are more likely to default according to the study Alternative data hasn t displaced credit scores Not all alternative methods will pass muster with regulators and gain widespread acceptance with lenders Social media feeds for example showed some early promise but enthusiasm for that idea waned once lenders considered the regulatory hurdles No bank wants to be tagged with they denied me because of my Twitter feed regardless of how predictive it may be says credit expert John Ulzheimer Similarly the credit scores of people in your household and in your social circle may predict how creditworthy you are but mainstream lenders aren t likely to embrace scores based on other people s behavior Factors should be palatable and fair in addition to being predictive and compliant says Ethan Dornhelm FICO s vice president for scores and predictive analytics Saying You ve got the wrong friends it doesn t sit well For now and the foreseeable future focus on your scores Much of the research has found that alternative data works best when used in conjunction with rather than as a replacement for traditional credit scores So the best way to keep your financial options open remains the same keeping your credit scores strong That means you should HAVE CREDIT If you re trying to build or rebuild your scores consider a secured card that gives you a line of credit equal to the deposit you make with the issuing bank Other options include a credit builder loan from a credit union or online lender or being added as an authorized user to a creditworthy person s account ACTIVELY USE CREDIT You don t need to carry a balance on your credit cards which is fortunate credit card debt is usually expensive and almost always unwise But regularly using credit cards helps maintain your scores So can paying installment loans such as student loans car loans and mortgages AVOID USING TOO MUCH CREDIT Maxing out your credit cards or applying for too many cards in a short period can ding your scores The less of your credit limits you use the better even when you pay in full every month",0

A THATCHED cottage in Dorset; four secluded acres and a hammock; fruit trees, chickens and berries straight from the bush. It's a goal that spurs many a jaded city dweller through a working day.   ","Alison Gibson on a couple with a sizeable windfall to invest after selling their idyllic thatched cottage.   

A THATCHED cottage in Dorset; four secluded acres and a hammock; fruit trees, chickens and berries straight from the bush. It's a goal that spurs many a jaded city dweller through a working day.    Michael Smith the owner of just such an idyllic haven confirms that the day you buy a thatched cottage can be one of the best days of your life The other high point apparently is when you sell After years in pastoral paradise Michael and his wife Janet began to yearn for the simple pleasures of life on a modern housing estate Michael an electrical officer in the Merchant Navy says When I am drinking wine in the garden on a sunny day I wouldn t swap my cottage for anywhere in the world But after mowing the grass for five hours the feeling pales And when it rains I may as well be in a Barratt house The high cost of maintenance is the main reason why Michael and Janet have decided to sell and move to an ordinary three bedroom bungalow The sale will also increase their disposable income In the cottage cost Pounds Extensive repairs have helped to boost its value to Pounds The bungalow is costing Pounds leaving Michael and Janet with a Pounds profit Michael says I see no reason to wait for property prices to rise further At the end of the day I have only got one stomach Of the Pounds windfall Pounds will be spent on modernising their new home Michael would like to use the remaining Pounds to fund an early retirement But Janet is having none of it he says She sees me as a young man and thinks I should work into my sixties Michael earns Pounds gross while Janet a part time classroom assistant earns Pounds They have a nine year old daughter Lucy The Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund a final salary scheme will pay Michael Pounds a year from age Janet does not have any pension provision beyond the state pension We would like to invest the Pounds to boost our eventual retirement income Michael says I would like a spread of risk A maturing endowment with Standard Life paid off their mortgage last year They were persuaded to start a new investment of Pounds a month in Standard Life s Global Advantage Fund They can afford to save a further Pounds a month and have Pounds in a savings account with Portman Building Society We asked a panel of financial advisers where they thought Michael and Janet should invest their windfall WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY Mark Dampier head of research Hargreaves Lansdown Michael and Janet should keep most of their money in cash until they have settled into their new home This gives them flexibility and they can always invest later There are two things that they need to do before they tie up any money in long term investments The first is to work out a detailed budget so that they have a better idea of how much retirement income they will need The second is to properly assess their attitude to risk Many investors say low risk when they really mean no risk They should seek the services of an independent financial adviser Avoid tied advisers such as the one from Standard Life because they can only advise on their company s products They are also unlikely to provide lifestyle type planning While considering the relatively short term goal of retiring in seven years time they should also work on the basis that they will want capital growth and income for another years Simply putting the entire amount in the building society and living off the interest is not a particularly great long term plan I would earmark Pounds for UK equity income funds such as Artemis Income Liontrust Income Invesco Perpetual Income Framlington Equity Income Credit Suisse Alpha Income and Jupiter Income I would put a further Pounds into distribution funds that combine both fixed interest and equities such as New Star and Invesco Perpetual and Pounds in three investment trusts I would keep the remaining Pounds in cash accounts using cash mini Isas first and then an ordinary account such as the ING Direct account Anna Bowes investment manager Chase de Vere I agree with Janet If Michael were to retire early they would probably struggle financially both now and in the future Everyone should keep some money in cash for emergencies and short term expenses but as you near retirement cash holdings should be increased I would put the extra Pounds a month into cash savings The Portman does not pay the best rates but there is always the chance of a demutualisation windfall Turning to investment a low risk portfolio would suggest that they invest heavily into fixed interest cash and property with a far smaller proportion in stocks and shares A division to consider would be per cent cash per cent fixed interest per cent property and per cent UK equities A slightly higher risk portfolio would make tactical sense because the price of equities is comparatively low at the moment I would therefore consider equity investments of per cent UK per cent US per cent European and per cent Far East The rest could be per cent cash per cent fixed interest and per cent property It is important to review a portfolio annually Standard Life Global Advantage is a mediocre performer Their holding could be transferred at no charge perhaps to Standard Life s Corporate Bond fund Brian Dennehy managing director Dennehy Weller Co It is perfectly understandable that Michael and Janet wish to be cautious Their capital is particularly valuable because it is earmarked for a key purpose retirement income in as few as seven years Furthermore the investment and economic background is fragile and will remain so for years to come The older you are the less risk you should take on I believe that the lower risk portion of a portfolio should be equal to your age in this case per cent Michael and Janet may feel more comfortable with per cent The other per cent could be a mix of medium risk such as UK equity income funds and high risk such as smaller companies or the Far East However I would prefer an investment period of no less than ten years for the Far East Rachel Faulkner pensions strategist Torquil Clark Michael should take into consideration that penalties could apply if he took pension benefits from his scheme before the normal retirement date He should obtain details He does not seem to be aware that he is likely to receive a tax free lump sum at retirement It is normally advisable to take this option and reinvest tax efficiently However this depends on personal circumstances Do not forget about the state pension A forecast of benefits can be obtained by completing a BR form available from www thepensionservice gov uk I do not see much point in putting the property windfall into pensions They are close to retirement and may even retire early Remember to invest in Janet s

investments alone I also need to do a lot of research before I invest and I need to understand pensions better The comments about the Standard Life fund confirm my disappointment The return so far has been pathetic I am glad we did not put in half as much as the salesman wanted We are looking forward to the move I have seen the world but Janet wants to travel and we will be able to afford it now I

"After Britain's vote to leave the European Union, ""within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s.""

- Hillary Clinton on Monday, June 27th, 2016 in remarks in Cincinnati, Ohio","After Britain's vote to leave the European Union, ""within 24 hours, Americans lost $100 billion from our 401(k)s.""

- Hillary Clinton on Monday, June 27th, 2016 in remarks in Cincinnati, Ohio THE RULING MOSTLY TRUE In a speech attacking her opponent Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump cheered while the economy reeled in the aftermath of Britain s shocking vote to leave the European Union On Friday when Britain voted to leave the European Union he crowed from his golf course about how the disruption could end up creating higher profits for that golf course even though within hours Americans lost billion from our k s Clinton said in Ohio June He tried to turn a global economics challenge into an infomercial Trump did say last week that Brexit would benefit Turnberry his golf course in Scotland because a weaker pound would bring more tourists We wondered though about the other part of Clinton s claim that Brexit caused million Americans with k retirement savings accounts to lose billion in just hours The nitty gritty Most k accounts are tied at least in part to the stock market And the market took a pretty big hit from the British referendum with the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropping percent and the S P index falling percent However we couldn t find an ongoing daily log of the total value of Americans k s The Investment Company Institute puts the figure at trillion as of March The Clinton campaign explained to us how they calculated that billion figure and experts told us the reasoning was sound Basically the campaign took that March figure for the total value of all k accounts trillion and calculated any growth through June the day before the Brexit vote and then the subsequent fall They based the growth on changes in the U S stock market as stocks account for about percent of k assets and fixed income which accounts for percent Their end result An estimated drop of billion in k assets from June to June Click here to see the full explanation of the campaign s math The campaign approached this analysis correctly said Wade Pfau an expert in retirement finance and founder of RetirementResearcher com They may have even underestimated the loss by assuming all stocks are U S stocks International stocks fell a lot further he said But certainly I think their analysis is a fair and reasonable assessment about the extent of the impact on k s Jack VanDerHei research director of the Employee Benefit Research Institute also said the campaign s calculation was a decent approximation of k losses after the Brexit vote Running his own numbers he came up with an estimated billion loss Experts said though that average k account holders don t need to panic The big picture The number sounds big but it is a small percent of the total and it is not as though this money is lost forever Pfau said Four days after the Brexit vote the U S stock market is starting to stabilize and creep back up Consequently so are the values of Americans k s Spokesmen at k providers Charles Schwab and Fidelity told us they had received many calls from account holders worried about their assets following the Brexit vote They both said they encourage clients to stay the course and remember that saving for retirement is a long term investment that shouldn t be irreparably harmed by last week s market volatility Generally k accounts belonging to younger people have a higher concentration of stocks in order to maximize growth for as long as possible But as account holders get closer to retirement they should reduce that concentration effectively reducing their accounts exposure to market volatility said Fidelity spokesman Mike Shamrell People who have the most stock in k are those who will be impacted the most so young people Shamrell said But they ve got the longest until they retire so years and years and years to make it up Alternatively if someone were to sell some of his or her assets amid the post Brexit vote market turmoil that would permanently lock in some of their losses Pfau said Our ruling After Britain s vote to leave the European Union within hours Americans lost billion from our k s Clinton said Experts told us that Clinton s calculation was a reasonable approximation of the loss of k assets amid market turmoil following the Brexit vote That being said those losses are very likely impermanent k accounts are long term investments designed to withstand brief shocks like this The claim is accurate but needs additional information so we rate Clinton s

sodomy charges for which he was first jailed by Dr Mahathir in The coalition campaigned on the understanding that Dr Mahathir would be prime minister for two years after which he would cede office to Mr Anwar It was also understood that the latter would receive a pardon and be released from prison as he was Will Dr Mahathir stick to the promise of a transition of power to Mr Anwar Well there have been a lot of people who mention two years he says but I am supposed to be the interim prime minister It may be two years it may be one year It may be three years I wouldn t know Pressed to clarify he remains cryptic I didn t know what to say but I believe that after two years he will take over Does Dr Mahathir regret the legal action against Mr Anwar in the late s Well I don t know about regretting he responds but at that time it was done by a court of law The trial lasted nine months All kinds of evidence was produced and the court decided It s not me So people will blame me for that but I don t interfere with the courts His critics he says want to take a political view of Mr Anwar s imprisonment I was not the best liked leader in the Western world because I m critical about other wrongdoings elsewhere he was famously outspoken against Israel so the moment they find reason to blame me they will Dr Mahathir suggests he could have resorted to Malaysia s Internal Security Act which allowed the government to detain a person without trial I didn t do that He went to the courts Asked if Mr Anwar s succession would be good for Malaysia Dr Mahathir says well that is what the people want It s not a question of what I like If the people want that they will have it How does Mr Anwar feel about his erstwhile jailer He seems to be quite nice Dr Mahathir says He sees me we talk to each other We didn t discuss about old things because we decided that those things are the past and we can t look at the past We have to look ahead As for the sodomy law Dr Mahathir says his government will not repeal it We are a Muslim nation and we do not tolerate sodomy The rest of the world may tolerate it but we cannot That is against our religion Dr Mahathir doesn t like the way radical Islam is commonly described in the West In Malaysia we believe that what we practice is Islamic fundamentalism If you go according to the teachings of Islam you will be able to set up a good society a good government You will not be oppressive What the West calls Islamist fundamentalism he says is a deviation from the teachings of Islam It s not Islam at all We have some people in Malaysia who are attracted to these deviations but we have been able to argue against them And by and large the people support us He alludes to his recent criticism of a Shariah court in the Malaysian state of Terengganu which ordered the caning of a lesbian couple It s not a moderate position he says of his own disapproval of the court it s an Islamic position I mean in Islam there is tolerance We have to be merciful and compassionate There are other forms of punishment It s not necessary to cane these people so we objected to that It gives a very bad impression of Islam He has said the two women should have had to undergo counseling not caning Another contentious facet of modern Malaysia is its entrenched system of racial preferences Ethnic Malays the Sons of the Soil in local parlance receive notable advantages over citizens of Chinese and Indian origin in jobs and educational opportunities Will the New Mahathir as Malaysians now describe him reset his country toward a goal of equality and genuine pluralism Will the idea of Malay dominance diminish There is no Malay dominance Dr Mahathir says quickly before launching into an explanation of how he sees his country s political demography The problem is we have three major communities and the wealth of the country is not evenly distributed between the three So we have to correct that If not he continues there will be tension as a result of the big disparity between rich and poor And if the rich belong to one race and the poor belong to another race then the potential for tension and conflict will be much greater The rich are Malaysia s Chinese and to a lesser extent its Indians the poor are the Malays What we did was to favor the poorer people so as to be able to catch up with the rich That is affirmative action Naturally affirmative action means that you have to discriminate against one group in favor of the other If you don t do that there can never be any changes in the disparities He intends however to effect one change Dr Mahathir plans to crack down on the widespread practice whereby Malay beneficiaries resell to businessmen of other races contracts they ve been awarded based on affirmative action We have to make sure that if we give a contract to the deprived community then they cannot sell or transfer the contract to anybody else If they do then the contract becomes invalid Dr Mahathir says he also is determined to address the more profound issues of corruption that bedevil his country These include the relentless prosecution of his predecessor Mr Najib who stands accused of gargantuan theft from a state owned fund known as MDB I believe that if the leader is not corrupt then the level of corruption will not be very high Dr Mahathir says What happened was that the prime minister himself was totally corrupt openly corrupt and because of that corruption spread throughout the whole government machinery and the business community There will be no amnesty deal with Mr Najib Dr Mahathir insists He claims he can explain everything that he didn t take the money And that is up to the judge to evaluate his defense against the prosecutor s evidence A legacy of the Najib years is a series of contracts with China which critics and economists believe will leave Malaysia deeply indebted Dr Mahathir has put most of these projects worth around billion in total on hold On a visit to Beijing in August he startled his hosts by speaking of a new version of colonialism an allusion to China s galloping economic expansion In New York Dr Mahathir says that the press put those words into my mouth I didn t say that even as there are YouTube clips online that show him uttering those words in the presence of an open mouthed Li Keqiang the Chinese premier In what appears to be a quibble over words Dr Mahathir insists that he meant neocolonialism in the sense that Sukarno said after independence Sukarno was Indonesia s president from Dr Mahathir says that any attempt to gain control of our country is a form of colonialism So we do not want that I wasn t specifically saying it about China He adds that it is the duty of an independent country to retain its independence by whatever means possible The Chinese projects involve huge borrowings and we cannot repay that money he says So the best thing to do is to drop the project But of course we have made agreements with them If unilaterally we drop the project we have to pay compensation so instead we proposed a postponement or a reduction in the scale The Chinese haven t said no so far They are listening to what we are proposing His own relationship with the giant neighbor to Malaysia s north isn t Dr Mahathir s only worry He doesn t like the growing hostility between the U S and China Confrontation I think isn t going to be good for anyone he muses referring to the presence of U S warships in the South China Sea It s far better to talk and discuss things rather than to send battleships to show your dislike for whatever move that the countries there make Donald Trump appears to disconcert Dr Mahathir who laughs nervously when asked about the American president We cannot make out what the presidency is like because he changes his mind sometimes three times in one day It s very unsettling because how do you deal with a person who is not consistent This is our worry Malaysia s previous prime minister says Dr Mahathir tried to bribe President Trump by offering to buy aircraft and all that He actually said he wanted to help the economy of the United States Malaysia is a small country We can t help people Mr Varadarajan is executive editor at Stanford University s Hoover Institution",0

Holly Black looks at the pros and cons

Once upon a time there was just cash or shares. More racy types of investment were allowed only in specialist products, usually reserved for the well-off. Then, in April 2016, a new type of Isa came along that allowed investors to tap into a different, dynamic part of the financial sector. The Innovative Finance IF Isa allows individuals to invest in peer to peer P P loans through the account and earn higher rates of interest than are available on the high street A P P loan is an investment where an individual lends money to another person or a business through a middleman service In return they are paid a set rate of interest for the duration of the loan and promised the return of their initial investment at the end Such investments have grown in popularity since the financial crisis because interest rates on bank and building society accounts have been so low As a result savers have had to look elsewhere for a decent return on their money The attraction of investing in P P loans is that the regular interest payments at higher rates mean you should get a more reliable return than if you invested in the stock market which can be volatile However sceptics point out that because this is a relatively new type of investment it is not yet clear how safe it is or what will happen in a recession should the number of borrowers defaulting on their loans start to ramp up Some P P providers have a safeguard fund which is designed to pay out in the event of this happening and many also split your investment across a number of different loans and in small chunks to protect you from being over exposed to defaults This is important because losses are not covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme As P P lending has become more popular though the interest rates on offer have come down The market leading P P platforms Zopa and RateSetter typically pay and respectively on their standard accounts Rates can be higher if you are willing to take more chances in the pursuit of bigger returns Zopa for example offers to those who opt for its higher risk account Zopa Plus Downing Crowd a rival platform says its returns range from all the way up to Another issue is that as demand from investors outstrips that from borrowers the former may have to wait for several days or even weeks before their money is matched to a lender and they can start earning the interest A further concern is that as P P providers have grown they have become less discerning in who they lend to In its first year for example Zopa approved only of the personal loan applications it received according to the peer to peer comparison site thWay Today it approves about of applications Default rates are low but have risen among the ranks of the borrowers on the books of many P P platforms This is partly a result of slowing economic growth rising interest rates and Brexit uncertainty having a big impact on the finances of business and individuals However Julia Groves co founder of Downing Crowd thinks that all these factors make IF Isas more appealing Political uncertainty is beginning to weigh on financial markets and cash is not quite the safe haven it once was as many savers have suffered years of low interest rates and high inflation At times such as these diversification is important and that is where the IF Isa can come in The take up so far has been muted though In its first year only IF Isas were opened and m subscribed In investors put m into accounts While that was a big jump Lifetime Isas were launched in and accounts were opened in its first year with m subscribed One of the reasons for the lower demand is that the IF Isa can be a little more restrictive than other Isas You can open only one of each type of Isa in each tax year but with a stocks and shares account you should still have access to the thousands of investment funds available in the UK If you open an IF Isa with a P P provider you will have access only to the loans on that platform That reduces the chances of finding what you may see as good borrowers paying good rates and also means that you run the risk of not spreading your bets widely enough While you can transfer an existing Isa balance into an IF Isa you cannot simply move existing P P loans into another IF Isa you must start afresh with new loans in the account Furthermore if you want to move from one P P provider to another it may be that the original platform can sell the loans you hold to the new provider but this will involve a fee and will depend on which companies you deal with Neil Faulkner co founder of thWay said Peer to peer lending is very stable compared to the stock market especially when you stick to the lower risk bread and butter types of loans The biggest risk is when investors do not grasp the need to spread their money across a lot of different providers and a very large number of loans to mitigate the risk of bad debts To reduce that risk it is important to research the provider you are using and to understand what sort of borrowers are on the platform Check the difference between the interest rate the borrower pays and the rate you are paid as a lender the gap between the two will show how large a slice the provider is taking as the middle man Higher rates of interest are tempting but tend to indicate greater risk If you are cherry picking individual loans to invest in rather than choosing a provider that spreads your money make sure you do your homework on that borrower Even with this approach however you should still take on a number of different loans so you do not run the risk of losing everything should one borrower default on its debt With these individual loans those that are asset backed or secured may be less risky as there will be an asset perhaps a property that the lender can sell in the event they are facing a default",0

In an appeal to these skeptics, some mutual-fund firms have introduced products they claim provide greater protection in bear markets than traditional balanced funds that blend stocks and bonds. Firms say that investors can find comfort in these new funds knowing that losses will be minimized and risk awareness increased But critics point to the higher fees and lack of a track record for some of these portfolios and question the need to tinker with established investing formulas I m quite skeptical of any fund that says you can have your cake and eat it too said Leo Marzen partner at New York based wealth manager Bridgewater Advisors Inc Among the new style mutual funds launched this year are so called absolute return funds from Putnam Investments a unit of Great West Lifeco Inc GWO CA and the AIM Balanced Risk Allocation Fund ABRZX US an asset allocation fund from Invesco Ltd IVZ US that invests according to risk management techniques In April Legg Mason Inc LM US launched Legg Mason Permal Tactical Allocation Fund LPTAX US the first mutual fund managed by its Permal fund of hedge funds affiliate Absolute return is a strategy that shoots for positive returns regardless of market conditions The problem say critics is twofold There s not much wrong with mainstream investing strategies that a tweaking of asset allocations can t fix and was such a bad year that everything suffered A lot of this is just a reminder that really nothing worked last year said John Coumarianos a mutual fund analyst at investment researcher Morningstar Inc Treasurys were the only thing that held up New and unproved Both Putnam and Invesco officials told MarketWatch that their new funds follow risk managed investment strategies that institutional clients have used for a long time Legg Mason added that its fund is designed to outperform other balanced offerings But regulations prevent firms from disclosing institutional performance and without a public track record investors in fact don t know what to expect For example said Ryan Leggio a Morningstar mutual fund analyst We re not even sure how AIM Balanced Risk Allocation fits in an investor s portfolio How can they say it s better than traditional balanced funds when they re still offering their own balanced fund Whether to own a balanced fund or an absolute return fund is a matter of individual preference said Scott Wolle manager of the AIM fund He said the fund could be used as a core holding noting that once the fund is available in his firm s retirement plan he will put all of his retirement savings into it Diversification is a key part of the strategy Wolle added with the portfolio split about equally among stocks bonds and commodities Morningstar s Leggio credits Invesco for the fund s diversification as well as commodities it has more international stock holdings than other balanced funds but he s concerned about its fees of higher than the median fee for a conservative asset allocation fund This fund will absolutely perform differently from other balanced funds Leggio said but will the commodities sleeve add value over or years At Putnam meanwhile Chief Executive Bob Reynolds has been the driver behind development of the firm s absolute return funds Morningstar analysts gave particularly scathing reviews of the Putnam effort The absolute return funds show a lot about Putnam s sales and marketing driven culture said Jonathan Rahbar a Morningstar fund analyst It s really a tough promise Reynolds sees it differently What Morningstar may not be aware of is that high net worth and institutional investors have used absolute return strategies successfully for years he said adding that Putnam has used the strategies for institutional clients for a decade Ben Alpert hedge fund analyst at Morningstar said many hedge funds promise absolute returns but those promises were worthless in a tough market last year The Morningstar Hedge Fund Index was down about in roughly percentage points better than the Standard Poor s stock index SPX US but a long way from positive Losses of were about the same as those suffered from traditional balanced mutual funds according to Morningstar I get concerned whenever I hear the phrase absolute return Alpert added Many hedge funds that have claimed absolute return strategies are very dependent on leverage and even if they do well for a while they tend to blow up after a few years That s an inflammatory statement Reynolds said These types of strategies have been used for a number of years and many haven t blown up Reynolds said Putnam s absolute return funds don t use leverage Echoing Invesco s Wolle Reynolds said there s a greater appetite among retail investors for new and different strategies Not chasing relative returns is a good idea for any investor he added noting that most institutional investors have to allocated to absolute return strategies A allocation to such strategies he said offers an anchor in the wind Changing approach For investors who want to make major portfolio shifts Morningstar s Coumarianos said a reasonable approach would be to alter their allocation to stocks and bonds In a recent article Russ Kinnel director of mutual fund research at Morningstar named five funds he believes offer potentially strong returns with less downside than pure stock funds Kinnel chose balanced offerings Vanguard Wellesley Income Fund VWINX US down in and Manning Napier Pro Blend Moderate Term Fund EXBAX US which lost in Other picks included Vanguard Convertible Fund VCVSX US which invests in convertible bonds and lost last year and FPA Crescent Fund FPACX US a go anywhere vehicle that can be long or short in stocks hold bonds or cash and was down in Kinnel also named Matthews Asian Growth Income MACSX US an income focused emerging markets fund that lost last year after being up in Notably each of these funds is a traditional mutual fund that invests in stocks and bonds and aside from the FPA fund uses mainly long only strategies There s really no reason to stray from what we ve known for the past years when it comes to investing Morningstar s Rahbar added As long as investors can maintain a long term focus they should benefit in the long run",0

Alexis Turner of London Taxidermy, which hires out and sells stuffed animals, birds and insects, is selling just such an arrangement for Ã‚Â£10,000. Displays of animals wearing clothes and doing things have something of a cult appeal with original Victorian anthropomorphic pieces having grown in value considerably he said Those by the English taxidermist Walter Potter have risen stratospherically proving an exceptional investment Pieces I remember going for in sales years ago are resurfacing for Impressive returns are not limited to the quirkiest examples of dead animal preservation Having largely overcome an image problem being considered niche nerdy or ethically dubious taxidermy is having a resurgence Big cat heads often sell for and narwhal tusks can command in excess of Depreciation is generally confined to the very controversial rhino horns and elephant feet Popularised by the work of artists such as Polly Morgan and Damien Hirst taxidermy now features in high end interiors and boutique hotels and there is a thriving trend for displaying giant white turtle shells or glass domed tropical birds High quality unfaded versions of the latter fetch up to You couldn t give these away years ago Turner said But nowadays a lot of the judgment has gone while our ancestors may not always have acted in an ethical manner the surviving specimens are of historical and cultural importance I have City lawyer and stockbroker clients who see it as an investment and status symbol While pure collectors focus on one big name taxidermist such as Rowland Ward or Peter Spicer Turner said that to get the best premium investor collectors should build a diverse collection that features well known names and antique examples of endangered species such as kiwis pangolins and platypuses Even better collect extinct animals if you get the chance and have the bank balance With a shrinking reserve of quality Victorian items to draw from rarity is coveted A near complete composite skeleton of a dodo was sold by Summers Place Auctions in West Sussex for in It wasn t actually an original skeleton Turner said It was made up of individual bones recovered from a swamp in southeastern Mauritius that someone had collected over the years There isn t a complete one to come on to the market and you wouldn t usually get an opportunity to buy a dodo skeleton in a lifetime If you want to invest seriously you need to be knowledgeable and take expert advice because it s easy to get caught out For example some items such as tiger skulls have become illegal to trade even if they re years old While most taxidermy that dates from before is exempt from the trading restrictions set out in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora proof of provenance is crucial Russell Oxley of the Derbyshire based Taxidermy Emporium has detailed sales order information dating from from the India based taxidermist Van Ingen Its mounted tigers and leopards account for much of Oxley s antique big cat stock A friend of mine visited the company s factory in Mysore south India just before it was demolished in and photographed the order book so you can trace how and where the animal was shot the date it came into the factory he said In the early th century more than tigers were roaming India and people were being killed so some were shot out of necessity Many of those hunted have become symbolic of the days of the British Raj and with that comes great esteem for collectors Oxley has seen the value of mounted big cat heads and tiger skin rugs with heads rise steadily over the past years something he attributes to best in class quality and a renewed interest in natural history He bought his first tiger skin years ago and said an extra zero could be added to the price today Van Ingen taxidermy is the old master of the trade They used the best materials and no one bettered them he said From about the demand has been massive I can t source enough pieces to meet client demand and many I speak to say they re putting their money in these rather than pensions",0
"Q: What is meant by an offset mortgage, and are these a sensible choice? A: An offset mortgage pulls together all your loans and savings into one pot. You only pay interest on the difference between the amount you are borrowing and the amount you are saving.

","Q: What is meant by an offset mortgage, and are these a sensible choice? A: An offset mortgage pulls together all your loans and savings into one pot. You only pay interest on the difference between the amount you are borrowing and the amount you are saving.  

The major advantage is that instead of receiving a separate interest rate on your savings - which is normally much lower than the mortgage rate you are paying - you simply pay a reduced level of interest on the mortgage.   For example if you had mortgage of and savings of you would only pay a net mortgage rate based on the you have outstanding As well as the advantage of effectively getting an excellent rate of return on your savings there is also the flexibility of being able to borrow more money to pay for a holiday for example without penalty You can also reduce the debt as you feel appropriate again without penalty These deals are becoming very popular and it is estimated that something like per cent of all borrowers now opt for an offset mortgage The downside is that the interest rates tend to be more expensive than standard mortgages but it may make sense if you have substantial savings to offset against the mortgage payments To get the best deal I d recommend that you see an independent mortgage adviser preferably one who is already adhering to the new regulatory practices due to come into effect from October Q WE are considering moving to the US permanently and wonder how this would affect investments if we kept them within the UK A If you become resident in the US you will become subject to that country s taxation on your worldwide income and investment gains To minimise your tax bill you will need to become non resident in the UK for taxation purposes In order to do this you need to ensure that you spend no more than days on average in the UK each year If not you may end up being taxed in both the US and the UK in which case you would need to complete tax returns in both countries However there is a double taxation agreement between the US and the UK which should avoid you being taxed twice on the same income and any gains that you make Assuming you become non resident in the UK you would be able to offset any income and gains against your personal allowances but you would then be taxable on this income in the US This is a specialist area and I suggest you speak to an accountant to understand the tax regulations of both countries and how best to structure your investments",0

You know your goal, but maybe it seems too far off in the distance, too improbable, too unattainable, for an everyday person like you to reach.

You've seen the success stories on TV, but those people inherited their money, had high-paying jobs, or hit it big with the lottery. Maybe you find yourself thinking, ""If only I were that lucky."" Well I ve got good news for you You can become a millionaire and it has nothing to do with your family s money or your education It has everything to do with you If you follow these principles you ll be on your way to becoming a millionaire Are you ready Steer clear of debt From cars to clothes to houses to jewelry you can get a loan for pretty much anything nowadays There s this idea floating around our culture that you should get what you want the moment you want it Get it now pay for it later And pay more later But hear me say this Debt is quicksand to your financial dreams Every time you buy something on credit you re digging a deeper hole for yourself That money you re sending to lenders is money you could be putting toward your future Take the average car loan which has a monthly payment of and a term length of five years and nine months If you were to invest a month for five years instead you could have And look at this If you invested that for another years you could have almost Now where s that car in years Most likely it s in a junkyard Invest early In addition to steering clear of debt investing early can help you become a millionaire If you start putting away a month beginning at age you could reach millionaire status by age and be sitting pretty on a million nest egg come retirement at That s just a month If you waited until age to start investing you d have to put away a month to hit the million dollar mark by age Let s look at it a different way If you invested a month for years you could have million If you invested that a month for years instead you d only have You d have to work an extra years to age to hit million And you d have to work until age to hit million Get serious about your savings If you want to become a millionaire the percentage you invest is just as important as the actual act of investing The average personal savings rate in the U S including retirement savings and emergency funds is percent If we apply that percentage to the median household income of about it works out to a year or around a month Invested over years assuming a percent rate of return that money could turn into That number looks great right It might until you find out the average couple will need for medical expenses in retirement and that doesn t include long term care If you subtract that amount from your investment total you d only have about left Can you live off that for two decades It ends up being only a year Let me give you a much better scenario If you invested percent of that income you would be putting away a year or around a month In years that could grow to million assuming a percent return And if you waited just five more years you d be sitting on over million That beats a year don t you think Increase your income to reach your goal faster When I talk about how to become a millionaire people often say But Chris I don t make that much money I can t save enough Let s get something straight here You don t need a six figure salary to become a millionaire However if you re crunching the numbers and realize you still can t put away the recommended percent you do need to increase your income so you can How do you do that You can get a job that pays more You can take on a second job temporarily Or you can get training to increase your skills demand and earning potential For example let s look at the field of nursing You can become a nursing assistant licensed practical nurse registered nurse or an advanced practice registered nurse Each of those jobs requires a different level of training and testing and their salaries all vary An LPN makes around a year while an RN makes around When you increase your skills and expertise you can increase your salary Cut unnecessary expenses As you work toward becoming a millionaire you also want to make sure your money is being spent with intention So sit down and evaluate your expenses regularly Look at your budgets from previous months to see where money may be leaking or where you could cut expenses That s money you could be investing and putting toward your percent Remember you control your expenses You may not dictate how much you re charged per watt of electricity but you do control the thermostat Keep your millionaire goal front and center The steps to becoming a millionaire run counter to most people s behavior which means you ll see friends and family going places doing things and buying stuff And if you focus on what they re doing you could be in trouble financially Just this year a study showed that percent of Millennials said they spent money they hadn t planned to because of what they saw on social media And percent of them along with percent of Gen Xers and percent of Baby Boomers believe social media creates a comparison problem We live in a comparison culture We buy stuff we don t need to impress people we don t even know Who are you trying to impress Seriously It s a good question to ask yourself when you re tempted to buy something you don t need The people I know who have become millionaires didn t get there by playing the comparison game They stayed focused on their own goals and didn t worry about what other people were thinking or doing Here s my challenge to you Instead of obsessing over what you don t have focus on the valuable but intangible gifts in your life family and friends your church work that matters the legacy you ll leave your children Those will bring you much greater and longer lasting joy than a new car or a destination vacation And know that it s OK to still enjoy stuff Just make sure it doesn t derail your larger plan to become a millionaire Chris Hogan is a No national bestselling author dynamic speaker and host of the Chris Hogan Show For more

Rates on annuities an insurance contract providing an income for life in return for a pension pot saw their biggest fall in three years last month plummeting One reason for the drop was a reduction in year gilt government bond yields which influence annuity rates Yields tumbled from to during August But a yes vote on Thursday could reverse this A move to an independent Scotland could push up yields as investors demand a bigger return from gilts because of increased uncertainty Alan Higham retirement director at Fidelity Worldwide Investment said We would likely see a weakening in gilt prices leading to higher yields pushing annuity rates up too Pension savers actual investments may wobble due to uncertainty in the markets but the rate at which you buy the annuity income may increase by or Billy Burrows of the specialist adviser Key Retirement Solutions said If Scotland was to vote yes there could be unintended consequences for everybody in the UK who is approaching retirement Annuities have fallen about over the summer If rates rise it would be good news for those considering an income for life policy In practical terms this could mean the income from a annuity increasing by about or more a year A year old with a pension pot can currently convert it into an average annual income of with a standard annuity according to the data firm Moneyfacts This means they would have to live for at least years in retirement to get back their entire pension in income Figures last week from the Association of British Insurers ABI showed that sales of annuities have fallen by more than a third from to between the first and second quarters of The drop followed changes announced by the chancellor in the budget in March allowing savers aged over to access their pensions flexibly from next April rather than having to buy an annuity However there was an increase in savers opting for enhanced annuities which pay a higher income to those with lower life expectancy due to illness or lifestyle choices such as smoking and drawdown used to draw an income from a pension while keeping the money invested in the stock market The number of drawdown products sold rose in the second quarter to June to almost Savers aged or over with pots of less than can take their pensions as a lump sum now without buying an annuity Individual pots of less than can also be taken as cash If a year old saver has a pension and a smaller pot of they could take the as cash now and with the bigger pot either buy an annuity or pay fees to go into drawdown or wait until April when they can take the in whatever way they please",0

That lesson was learned by budget committee chairmen a few Decembers ago after they led Congress to enact - and then quickly to repeal - legislation that would have permanently capped military retirees' annual cost-of-living adjustments one percent below inflation. The power of that coalition is now fractured over whether to support key recommendations of the Military Compensation and Retirement Modernization Commission Some of these groups are turning thumbs up others thumbs down and most still want to see more analysis on proposals to replace triple option TRICARE and to phase in a new retirement system As the House armed services subcommittee on personnel discovered Wednesday at a stakeholders hearing where a group stands will depend on whom it serves Associations largely representing career retirees want to preserve the value and not risk force retention effectiveness of traditional year retirement for future generations of service members Groups with larger veteran populations most of whom left service after a tour or two and with no retirement benefits favor the commission s call to blend a smaller immediate annuity at or more years service with a new k like savings plan that has government matching of member contributions and full vesting in the balance after only two years of service Reserve and Guard associations also tend to favor the more modern retirement features found in the private sector And though a majority of groups are wary of replacing TRICARE even with a new health care allowance for in service families to buy coverage off a menu of commercial health insurance plans the National Military Family Association sees potential here for families to gain more choice and faster easier access to care Rep Joe Heck R Nev chairman of the personnel subcommittee said the heavy lift for Congress from among commission recommendations is retirement health care and on base stores and lawmakers need to hear the views of stakeholder groups This day they heard a cacophony not a choir Scott Bousum legislative director of the Enlisted Association of the National Guard praised the commission for designing flexible mechanisms that current and future service members can use to choose health care and retirement packages that fit their individual needs The retirement system today said Brendon Gehrke senior legislative associate for Veterans of Foreign Wars leaves roughly percent of all veterans behind their civilian counterparts in saving for retirement While nearly percent of fulltime civilian workers have access to employer sponsored retirement plans and percent of employers with k plans match contributions by employees Gehrke said the government contributes nothing to the retirement of those who often are the most deserving those who bore the burden of battle Though not rejecting the commission s plan outright retired Air Force Col Michael Hayden director of government relations for Military Officers Association of America said MOAA is concerned the plan lacks the drawing power to keep enough members in service out to years and beyond Also Hayden testified the combined effect of higher insurance premiums for working age retirees and lower retirement value if these were in place today would pare compensation for a retired E with years by over a year for a loss of percent until they can start to draw from their government matching thrift savings plan at age and a half The commission s push for flexibility and choice in health insurance and retirement options though lauded by some was challenged by Hayden as creating uncertainty both for careerists in understanding the value of their compensation and for force managers in retaining personnel Service members stationed around the world should not have to worry if they have selected the appropriate retirement fund or appropriate health care coverage for their families Hayden said Making radical changes to the core retention programs risks unintended negative effects Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America surveyed its members all combat veterans and found percent favor retirement reform said IAVA s Chris Neiweem They see it as fundamentally unfair that one could serve or years with three four five or more deployments and leave the military with absolutely no retirement benefit Neiweem said Yet a careerist who possibly never even deployed could be entitled to full benefit package Rep Tim Walz D Minn a retired Army National Guard command sergeant major asked if the witnesses accepted the notion that to gain portable retirement benefits for percent of the force the value of traditional year retirement would have to be cut for future members MOAA doesn t believe that Hayden said But VFW s Gehrke said theoretically it doesn t have to be but without a tradeoff costs are going to skyrocket He said the commission plan is the next best alternative Heck asked if witnesses if they agreed with one commissioner who said TRICARE is broken and can t be fixed Bousum Hayden Neiweem and John Stovall national security director for the American Legion disagreed Gehrke however described TRICARE as in a death spiral And Karen Ruedisueli deputy director of government relations for National Military Family Association agreed with that commissioner that TRICARE is broken The commission s TRICARE Choice proposal Ruedisueli said merits serious consideration given its potential to provide families a more robust and valuable health care benefit one that would address many beneficiary complaints about the current system But NMFA needs more proof she said that subsidizing access to commercial health insurance won t jeopardize overall medical readiness to support the troops or trigger higher out of pocket costs for families",0

He discussed the investing industry's practices and how fees can erode a nest egg significantly.

Today, I want to focus on another part of that interview Ã¢â‚¬â€ how the financial burden of retirement has shifted from organizations (corporations and governments) to individuals. The effects have been profound and are ushering in what Bogle called a coming train wreck for American retirees As recently as a few decades ago the retirement income foundation for most people consisted of a pension Social Security and personal savings in that order However that model has effectively been reversed Most companies have switched from defined benefit plans like pensions to defined contribution plans like k s With a pension the company is responsible for a defined benefit like paying a certain percentage of an employee s final salary throughout retirement Under a k plan the company is responsible for a defined contribution which is usually a match on employee contributions Without pensions workers are on their own for retirement income The retirement income foundation for people without pensions is personal savings and Social Security For the pension less retirement income is largely a personal responsibility as opposed to an obligation of a company or government entity But even those with pensions could be in for rocky futures according to Bogle That s because many corporations along with state and local governments assume returns of percent on the investments that fund their pension obligations Bogle said those returns are simply not going to materialize over the next decade or so he said to percent was more realistic If the investments don t perform that means corporations and governments need to pump more money into the plans or provide fewer benefits for pensioners The second piece of the foundation Social Security is on shaky financial ground Bogle said it s underfunded and in need of reform If not retirees may have to accept fewer benefits And if we go too long without fixing the system it may dissolve altogether Given the iffy health of Social Security it s scary so many will rely on it almost exclusively for retirement income This is where personal savings should fill the gap But many Americans simply don t have enough saved Take a look at the findings from the Northwestern Mutual Planning Progress Study n One third have less than in retirement savings n percent have nothing saved n One third of Baby Boomers have or less saved n percent of those surveyed have not planned for outliving their money On top of that Bogle pointed to another problem A primary retirement savings vehicle the k is ill suited for retirement savings for a few key reasons First you can take your money out Second you can borrow from the account And third there is too much investment choice People derail their retirements by withdrawing money early from retirement accounts or taking loans from them And most people aren t suited to picking investments It can be overwhelming and complex All of these forces combined are why Bogle said we re on course for a train wreck But it s not all doom and gloom While k and similar plans aren t perfect they re good options for most people As the Northwestern Mutual study shows the problem isn t people saving in the wrong places it s that they re not saving enough period Saving more will obviously help Beyond that there are tools and strategies available to help you live the retirement you want even if the market doesn t perform For instance annuities and cash value insurance like an indexed universal life policy can provide income in retirement and they often have protections from market fluctuations When you think about it a lot of this stuff is out of our control It s not like you or I can singlehandedly fix the Social Security system or any one pension fund So control what you can control Two great places to start are with personal savings and getting financial help from a trusted professional Increasing your savings basically gives future you a raise Who doesn t like a raise Don t forget the retirement income responsibility falls primarily on your shoulders It s complex Getting help could mean avoiding the train wreck and ultimately be one of the best decisions you ever made Holly Peterson is the owner of Elite Retirement Strategies and a former radio show host You can find her online at eliteretirementstrategies com or by calling",0

The project, which is due to launch in 2019, aims to allow savers to see all of their retirement pots in one place at the same time, giving them greater awareness of their assets and how to plan for their retirement. Earlier this month the Department for Work and Pensions DWP announced the industry would be allowed to develop its own dashboards alongside a non commercial service hosted by the single financial guidance body SGFB According to Darren Cooke chartered financial planner at Derbyshire based Red Circle Financial Planning the project would be a case of if you build it they will ignore it He told FTAdviser some advised clients already had the ability to view most if not all of their plans in one place through a client portal He said Not all advisers offer it I do and my experience is clients in general don t use it very much In general they will also be able to log on to a provider s website and see their pension there again I don t think many bother They don t even bother to look at their annual statements so I m not sure why an on line portal will make much difference Mr Cooke agreed with those who believed the project would only be successful if it included all pension pots held by the individual He said That would require compulsion and for all pension providers and trustees to be able to provide data to the dashboard At present most can t do that Any half baked attempt won t work and will quickly fall out of favour and die I think I would be happy to be proved wrong but I think it s a massive white elephant Steven Farrall senior partner at Suffolk based Williams Farrall Woodward argued the project would be useful for IFAs and their clients if it worked which he didn t believe would be the case He said All advisers worth their salt already have or have in development online portals that deliver a dashboard And can already produce an integrated pensions report from the data they hold Data aggregation is what we do Mr Farrall argued that for the project to be delivered it will have to be funded by taxes on clients by forcing pension schemes and insurers to pay for it or by taking additional trading taxes from advisers and investment companies He said The poor bloody client always pays In short the pensions dashboard is a colossal waste of money It s already being done by the market This is just another regulationist and or political vanity project Millions of pounds will be wasted Double spent if you like Shut it down Paul Stocks financial services director at Dobson and Hodge argued the project will be most useful for the non advised clients which have a number of pension pots who would benefit from one information source covering all of their arrangements However Mr Stocks noted that he was always wary of information without context and also the information overload what is currently present in illustrations provider paperwork He added Nonetheless anything which boosts engagement between investors and their financially planning should generally be seen as a good thing maria espadinha ft com",0

II ages and their parents live longer Bogaczyk s dilemma is echoed in some form in nearly every family faced with securing long term care for an aging relative without sidelining its own retirement plans Rhonda Papell a homemaker in Brentwood found herself thrown a year ago into the role of caregiver for an estranged mother in law with extreme dementia This is someone we didn t have a relationship with Now she is basically my job Papell spends much of her time managing a stream of complicated medical billing for her mother in law and wondering how she and her husband will continue paying the a month board and care bill after the mother in law s money runs out Rochelle Mallen a homemaker in Encino felt it necessary to hire a full time live in caregiver for her year old father David even though he is mobile and sharp as a tack Before the bear market set in pressure was substantial on working people of the sandwich generation those caught between caring for aging parents and saving for their kids college funds Now in addition to all that these sandwichers are having to factor severely contracted retirement portfolios into the equation And that is proving a bitter pill to swallow Retirement plus It s like retirement plus says Jason Karpf a marketing manager in Chatsworth who is juggling retirement planning for his mother saving for college for his own two grade school children plus planning his own retirement You have to put yourself on a financial discipline says Karpf It s like a diet Karpf was very involved in helping to manage his grandfather s entrance into a rest home for Alzheimer s patients and he learned from that experience how difficult financing such care can be even when the patient has planned well He had a healthy fixed income but all of it was quickly consumed It was quite a financial balancing act to make sure all the right choices were made says Karpf And while his own mother is in decent shape with a pension from the Writers Guild and access to the Motion Picture Television Fund s retirement home in Woodland Hills Karpf worries about financing the unexpected You can only plan so much he says Even in situations where the elderly themselves are paying for their own long term care the management of that care can become a full time job with serious financial ramifications for the relative who takes it on People are quitting their jobs to give the care then they lose their own health benefits says Bonnie Lawrence communications manager at Family Caregiver Alliance a state nonprofit that helps overwhelmed caregivers manage the dizzying elder care system A survey by the FCA found that percent of people helping to care for an elderly relative had quit their job to provide care and percent had reduced their work hours It causes an economic ripple through the system says state Sen Sheila Kuehl D Los Angeles who introduced a bill signed into law last month that would allow employees in California up to six weeks paid leave to attend to the needs of children spouses or elderly relatives facing debilitating conditions or requiring other care In addition the California Legislature pushed through a tax credit in to help cover the cost of such long term care But that s cold comfort when long term care insurance premiums can approach that amount for a couple in one month The basic categories of long term elder care include in home care by a registered nurse which can cost more than a month depending on how it is billed nursing homes which fall in terms of level of care somewhere between assisted living and a hospital a month and assisted living and retirement homes plus monthly In addition to these full time options there are various forms of part time care such as adult day care centers a day popular with elderly people cohabitating with a family caregiver There is also a growing trend with California at the forefront of keeping the elderly in their own homes and delivering services like cleaning or grocery shopping on an ad hoc basis Some of these services are covered by government programs for seniors with few or no private assets But a lot of it comes out of the pockets of the elderly themselves and their children Of billion spent on elder care in the latest figures available billion came from private pockets versus billion from federal and state coffers according to a Family Caregiver Alliance survey of resource centers including two in Colton and Los Angeles tag f Helvetica f b f i s w l tag Pinched and sandwiched off tag l tag off The owners of those pockets are fully aware of their unenviable situation They are pinched and they are sandwiched says Nancy Wexler a geriatric care manager in Tarzana who helps place and monitor seniors who need elder care services They are also usually surprised at the high cost of services and how few assets a senior must have to qualify for government coverage I once asked a social worker about families and sticker shock says Anne Burns Johnson president of the California Association of Homes and Services for the Aging She said that the first time they begin to explore elder care services they are horrified by the cost Then they get called to the emergency room five times in a month and that s Making decisions about elder care is hardest for caregivers helping middle income elderly people those who make too much to qualify for state or federal programs but not enough to pay out of pocket for top quality assisted living centers or professional home care for extended periods of time Medicare does fine with people in hospitals but it doesn t do anything for long term care unless people are penniless says Frank Weber an estate planner in West Covina So where does that leave adult children of elderly people with expensive long term needs Elder care consultants urge planning as the only way to avoid financial havoc brought on by an aging parent with expensive needs and no assets But they also say most clients they see are not well prepared and don t realize they cannot count on government programs to provide long term health care Our society is not prepared for the impact of having an elder who needs care says Carol Goldman a geriatric care manager at Caremanagement Services in Long Beach They don t have nearly the information or education they need They re like Oh my God this is happening can you help First folks over with or more in assets should look into long term health care insurance which has only been around for about a decade says Joseph Solomon an elder care planner in Los Angeles Premiums aren t cheap around a year for a year old but the benefits aren t usually limited to specific services and the cost of the premiums is tax deductible But as with any kind of insurance reading between the lines is crucial Goldman an expert in the field says she was surprised to discover that a long term care policy her father in law had only covered him for two years An alternative or supplement to long term care insurance is to put assets into a fixed income annuity that is Medi Cal friendly meaning a monthly annuity payment that doesn t affect Medi Cal coverage for a nursing home says Solomon For folks who are house rich and cash poor the best bet is taking a reverse mortgage on the house then putting that into a fixed income annuity creating a guaranteed long term payout Whatever option people do choose to care for their elders they must choose something and plan ahead for it You have to do it for your children and your grandchildren says Karpf the marketing manager in Chatsworth It s your final act of love toward them dlim end",0

Their vehicle? So-called direct-lending funds, which make loans to midsize companies, typically those with revenue between $10 million and $1 billion. Companies use the loans for growth, acquisitions or refinancing. Such loans used to be the province of banks But tightened lending standards coupled with a stricter regulatory environment have curtailed banks willingness to extend credit making it harder for companies to get loans The loans are usually senior secured loans which means they are the first to be repaid says Andre Hakkak a managing partner at White Oak Global Advisors an investment management and advisory firm in San Francisco with million in assets under management Direct lending funds have stepped in to fill the gap Many of them have generated annual returns between and over the past two years according to industry participants though returns were even higher in and By comparison the total return for the PowerShares Senior Loan Portfolio an ETF that tracks a leveraged loan index returned in according to investment researcher Morningstar Fees are steep though and borrowers can default on the loans The funds also lock up investors money for years Still more wealth managers and their clients are looking at direct lending funds now Interest in the sector tends to ramp up after down economic cycles says Preston Massey a co founder of Congruent Investment Partners an investment firm in Dallas that specializes in direct lending and has million in assets under management Both White Oak and Congruent work with individuals and family offices and say they are seeing increased interest More clients are willing to lock their money up for a longer time in order to get higher yields says Travis Baldwin a co founder of Congruent We re happy with the safety of municipal bonds but they re not providing a rate of return that exceeds the rate of inflation says Will Braman chief investment officer at Ballentine Partners a firm in Waltham Mass with billion in assets The firm will begin offering direct lending funds to clients this quarter and is recommending they put between and of their fixed income allocation into the funds The funds charge fees that resemble those of hedge funds For example depending on the investor the current fee structure for the direct lending fund at White Oak is a management fee and a performance fee once the fund earns at least In there were direct lending fund launches within hedge fund firms up from in according to data from Preqin No one tracks total assets in direct lending funds but wealth managers and the funds themselves say the funds are growing Like hedge funds direct lending funds have lockup periods in which investors can t access their money typically for about five years or more though they receive quarterly interest payments Investment minimums for the funds can range from to million leading wealth managers to collect smaller stakes say from multiple clients Jim Holtzman a wealth manager in Pittsburgh has considered putting client money in direct lending funds but hasn t pulled the trigger because of the lack of liquidity and transparency You need to have a lot of faith in the company that s doing the lending in the first place because its information isn t public and there are no industry benchmarks against which to measure performance The loans default rate is generally between and Ballentine s Mr Braman says but the recovery rate or the percentage that you can get back on a defaulted loan is about As a result the net default rate is less than By contrast the historical average global default rate for high yield bonds is while the recovery rate for senior unsecured high yield bonds is about according to data from Moody s A company defaulting is not common but it happens says Congruent s Mr Massey Despite the drawbacks managers are expecting clients to keep putting money into the funds There s a lot of interest from high net worth clients says Marc Lasry whose hedge fund Avenue Capital Group plans to launch a direct lending fund in Europe Subscribe to WSJ http online wsj com mod djnwires",0

An amateur DIY fan has saved hundreds of pounds after knocking together a kitchen island made from IKEA bookcases. Vikki Cosgrove says she s never been prouder after replacing her dated old table herself spending just in the process With her heart set on a new island the year old from Andover Hampshire looked around for freestanding sets online but was flabbergasted by the prices which started from around I have always wanted an island but I didn t think I could ever afford one and I have such a small space to work in I didn t think it would ever work she said After learning to use a drill in lockdown she was determined to find a way to make it work so she searched the internet for a hack Get the biggest news delivered to your inbox Sign up for the Mirror s free newsletters Vikki found someone who had built one themselves using old IKEA furniture and she decided to give it a go Heading off to the store with her mum they picked up one large Billy bookcase costing and one small costing which would act as the base On top she used a tabletop from the desk section and bought two brackets to put it together priced at each Finally Vikki also picked up three high stools which were reduced from to each at the Swedish furniture store At a separate hardware store she then bought some screws and a tongue and groove pack of five for to cover the back of the bookcases The materials for the island cost plus for the stools bringing the total to Although Vikki already had a drill a screwdriver set and a sander she also invested in a small jigsaw from B M for Her mum helped her with the initial building of the flatpack but then she got to work by herself piecing it all together She said I assembled the two bookshelves then screwed them together using the hardware store screws and a spirit level to ensure they were level Once they were screwed in using the holes already in the shelves I flipped it over to add the tongue and groove to the back I measured the total width of the bookcases which in this case was cm I measured each part of the tongue and groove and cut it using the jigsaw I did this to all five pieces and then sanded the edges down I got nail tacks and hammered these in which finished off the back as well as giving it more strength I then added on the tabletop measuring all around to ensure it was even on each side so it wouldn t be too heavy on one side I drilled holes into the top of the bookshelf and then screwed through the holes to secure the top to the shelves I added the brackets to secure the top and more to the bottom to secure it to the floor to stop it from toppling With a little more help from her parents she put the chairs together and slid them underneath The finished island now has pride of place in her kitchen and she was able to give away the tired dining table and chairs she had before She said I have never been prouder of myself I have been single for a long time so decided it was time to learn how to DIY and I have loved it Everyone has been so complimentary even carpenters and builders have said what a good job I have done I cannot wait to have people round for dinner and cocktails Vikki posted a clip of her work on TikTok and over people viewed her project One person said You did so well The end result is really nice too Better than the little set you had What a difference that makes Defines the whole space Well done added someone else I love Billys but I was sceptical But nope It s gorgeous Amazing job wrote a third person Got a story Get in touch by emailing alex bellotti reachplc com",0

She asked me if I'd like to contribute with no guarantees that my advice would be published. I laughed at the notion that ""the Donald"" or his editors would actually select my advice from the thousands collected, but I responded anyway. Lo and behold last week I received a package in the mail containing Mr Trump s new book The Best Real Estate Advice I Ever Received Top Experts Share Their Strategies along with a letter from the publisher thanking me for my contribution I flipped through the book and there it is on page I also saw that fellow Friday Home Guide columnist M Anthony Carr is a contributor When I received the phone call requesting the contribution the Washington area real estate market was on fire with buyers tripping over themselves to write contracts The subject of my advice was a warning to would be real estate investors that hot markets aren t sustainable and that patience is often required for the investment to pay off Real estate has proven to be a good investment over time but it does not lack periods of stagnation Let me describe the real estate market during the first half of this decade There were multiple buyers for every house on the market Prices were skyrocketing and buyers were stripping themselves of every protection by eliminating such common contract contingencies as a home inspection the ability to obtain a mortgage and an appraisal Clearly such a hot market is not sustainable My advice to Mr Trump was simple Recognize that real estate while a good investment over time may require patience and staying power Folks expecting to double their money in a year are in for a rude awakening if their investment is ill timed If property values dip or the rental market slows the investor must have the ability to hold the investment long enough to overcome dips in the marketplace Let s fast forward to the present It turns out my real estate advice wasn t bad I turned to my friend and true real estate expert Bill Barnes of Barnes Real Estate Co in Alexandria and he summarized the current market like this The number of days on the market for a new listing is approaching days compared with less than a week two years ago home prices are declining because houses are being priced at the same levels as when the market was at its peak Since there are far fewer buyers sellers are coming off those peak prices A herd mentality exists in the marketplace When the market was hot investors flocked to write a contract as soon as a property came on the market Today with the help of the media s incessant negative reporting on the real estate market the same herd is wary to write a contract fearful that property values will fall This creates fewer buyers while inventory grows The Washington area real estate market is bound to lose a bit more steam before it picks up again But Washington has proved to be resilient and someone who buys real estate has made a good investment if the intent of the purchase is a long term investment Henry Savage is President of PMC Mortgage in Alexandria Reach him by e mail henrysavage pmcmortgage com",0

another there was going to be an eruption For Iraq our book assumed the war added to to the price of oil The reason we did that was we thought no one would object to numbers that were so conservative The price had gone from per gallon to Lots of things are always going on but it was not coincidental that the price started going up very strongly after the war And corroborating our view was that prior to the war the futures markets had expected the price to remain around a gallon One of the other things we argued in the book remember this was before the financial crisis was that one of the reasons for our lax monetary policy which we thought was distorting the economy and contributing to a bubble was that purchasing power was being taken out of the economy to buy oil and the Federal Reserve had to compensate for that and it did it through looser monetary policy And the other major costs that aren t included in our initial accounting The big points we raised in Iraq and Afghanistan and have updated in congressional testimony pdf are the disabilities the health care costs that follow the war and the equipment you have to replace after the war I ve seen you make the point that as an economist who won a Nobel prize for studying the the role of information in decision making skipping this honest accounting process deprives us of crucial information we need to make good decisions about matters of war Could you expand on that a bit This is particularly the case for wars of choice which most recent wars have been When we were attacked in Pearl Harbor we weren t going to go through a cost benefit analysis of responding The Iraq War however was a war of choice And if you re going to approach that with any degree of rationality you have to think about what it s going to cost you To do that you want an inclusive cost estimate particularly because you know the government is going to try and narrow the cost down They re going to talk about only the cost of the bombs whereas we emphasized that there are a whole other set of costs taking care of the disabled replacing equipment etc that any good accounting system would take into account One objection people often raise to this line of thinking is that the president needs to move fast when making decisions about whether to go to war and if we normalized a budgeting process he d lose that crucial flexibility Two points One the Iraq War was a war of choice and so we didn t have to rush in We weren t being bombed But the second point is that even if you don t go through this analysis before you embark as you re fighting the war these issues arise over and over again During the war we made a lot of penny wise and pound foolish decisions To not spend on body armor at the beginning clearly increased our spending in the long run Same for mine resistant vehicles which are as much as a million dollars apiece They re expensive but compared to not buying them they re cheap A large fraction of the disabilities would ve been avoided if they d had those rather than Humvees If you d had the accounting based on the full cost of health care you would ve known they were a bargain The other objection is that you can t put a price on a human life Iraq was advocated on at least partially humanitarian grounds and the intervention in Libya came in the context of a more acute humanitarian crisis So can you really try to make these projections when so many lives hang in the balance I m sympathetic to the view that the economics are not everything We didn t try to value the benefit of winning the war for instance But whatever our judgments about the benefits we have to be realistic about the costs I don t think any of us thought tallying the costs would provide the answer to whether we should do it But not to have those costs is a vital mistake In the case of valuing lives that was one of the things we really sought to emphasize If you started valuing lives of just our troops you would realize the cost of the Iraq war was enormous We don t value the lives of our troops in the way we value lives in the Environmental Protection Agency or the Department of Transportation If we started using those numbers we d get a very different total cost and even more so if we began valuing Iraqi lives You ve written that some of the rules you came across while researching your book shocked you In particular you brought up the odd way we pay for contractor insurance Can you go into a bit more detail on that We require contractors to have insurance But no private guy will pay for the insurance so we pay for the insurance ourselves Interestingly the bad actor in all this was AIG The government went and contracted with AIG paying them the premiums and then after the contractors got injured AIG claimed that the injuries were excluded under their policy So they d exclude for instance death from combat but take a very broad definition of combat where everyone in the combat zone was in combat So they d be getting these premiums and there d be almost no one who they d admit qualified for the benefit So we were paying the premiums to AIG and in most cases they were denying the claims",0

A five-year performance comparison shows value managers have beaten the rest of the funds. There are many different ways of measuring the strength of fund managers returns assets and risk to name but a few One theme that often comes up is the question of style and what that comes down to is the matter of value versus growth Value managers are those who buy stocks that appear to be undervalued in the belief that they will turn around and reflect their true value Growth involves buying stocks that you think will go up even if they re fairly or overvalued now There are various in between styles growth at a reasonable price neutral core but most mainstream styles fall somewhere on a spectrum between these two poles The two years of soaring markets from March to March were ideal for a growth manager in that most things went up and continued to do so long after value managers could no longer see anything that warranted buying So it s interesting to note that when prominent research group Morningstar last week printed a study of Australian large cap share fund managers most of the top ranked ones were value managers and the bottom ranked ones were growth Specifically five of the managers deserved the highly recommended ranking They are BGI GMO Investors Mutual Perennial Value and Perpetual Investments All of them bar BGI which Morningstar calls a blend style are value investors The lowest grade Morningstar gave to any manager was hold which it conferred on Axa HSBC Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch All but HSBC are growth styled managers Why does value win Well partly because Morningstar isn t just evaluating the past two years it s looking back over the past five and that includes a bear market In terms of capital preservation value managers fared much better at protecting investors capital in falling markets says Morningstar On average this group produced a per cent return in compared with a minus per cent average return from growth managers Morningstar sees two other reasons First value stocks outperformed growth stocks Specifically after the tech stock bubble burst in March investors shifted to defensive stocks which had been left undervalued as the herd piled into technology stocks As a result prices of defensive stocks rose and defensive stocks were where value styled investors had put their money Secondly smaller cap stocks have done better than large cap stocks in four of the past five years and value managers tend to have a higher exposure to mid caps Nevertheless Morningstar adds a caution While style and size factors have helped value style managers deliver competitive returns the free ride that value has enjoyed appears to be over Morningstar thinks that in a future choppy market returns are going to come down to good stock selection no matter what the style of the manager",0

The Protecting the U.S. Corporate Tax Base Act of 2016 is the third in a series of bills introduced by Levin and other House Democrats to curb various corporate tax strategies such as inversion. Americans believe that the tax code is rigged against them and when companies can use complicated loopholes to avoid paying their fair share of taxes they re not wrong Levin said in a statement One of the tax strategies targeted by the legislation hopscotching allows a foreign parent company or foreign affiliate to lend the tax deferred overseas earnings of foreign subsidiaries of U S companies known as controlled foreign corporations or CFCs to non CFC foreign affiliates The borrowed funds can then be used to repay debt make capital investments in the U S and elsewhere purchase the stock of a related domestic or foreign corporation or make dividend payments to shareholders CFCs can thus circumvent a rule in Section of the Tax Code that was intended to prevent the use of a CFC s untaxed earnings for direct investments in the U S without incurring U S tax The legislation would end this tax strategy by providing that a U S shareholder s gross income includes not only a pro rata share of any increase in the CFC s investment of earnings in United States property but also a pro rata share of any increase in the CFC s investment of earnings in foreign group property The second tax strategy de controlling enables foreign controlled U S multinational groups to avoid U S taxes on the deferred earnings of CFCs by reducing the U S ownership of CFCs just below the level that subjects the foreign subsidiaries to U S taxation The term controlled foreign corporation is defined as any foreign corporation if more than percent of its stock is owned by U S shareholders To de control a controlled foreign corporation a non CFC foreign affiliate can transfer sufficient amount of property to the CFC in exchange for percent or more of the CFC stock The result is that the foreign corporation is no longer a controlled foreign corporation Once a CFC is de controlled it is free to make direct investments in United States property without triggering U S taxes The bill would close this loophole by providing that the stock of a foreign corporation owned by a foreign person is attributed to a related United States person for purposes of determining whether the related U S person is a United States shareholder of the foreign corporation and therefore whether the foreign corporation is a controlled foreign corporation The Treasury Department issued temporary regulations in April to prevent hopscotching by inverted companies The hopscotching provision in the Protecting the U S Corporate Tax Base Act of is broader and would apply to U S companies that have inverted along with U S multinational companies that have been acquired by foreign companies The de controlling provision was included in President Obama s fiscal year and budget proposals",0

The new ordinance is one of three designed to hold banks accountable for properly maintaining foreclosures and homes that are likely to go that way Lenders now will have to provide accurate information of the responsible contacts of such homes upon the filing of a notice of default which is the first formal step in the foreclosure process Similar ordinances exist in plus California cities based on council documents We could get another wave of foreclosures and defaults said Councilman David Alvarez who was the key council supporter of this ordinance This will prepare us for the next wave Center on Policy Initiatives and Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment were the main drivers of the ordinance Banks will have to pay a fee for each property within days of the notice of default filing If lenders fail to do this they will face a fine of a day capped at a year San Diego County has suffered through more than foreclosures since mainly the result of reckless lending practices Although foreclosures in the county have fallen more than percent since they peaked at in July they are still higher than normal based on numbers from real estate tracker DataQuick Close to foreclosures were recorded in September countywide still higher than the month average of The code enforcement department expects the city will have to hire three positions to maintain the registry at a cost of a year which includes salary pensions health care and other hiring costs based on a memo by Robert A Vacchi deputy director of the city s neighborhood code compliance department The program is intended to be cost recoverable which means the fees collected will cover the cost of the program My biggest concern is this said Zapf who opposed the measure I don t want one dime coming out of the general fund If it s fully cost recoverable then it better be fully cost recoverable We re talking about three administrative positions based on a number that is going down The two other ordinances passed in September are the Abandoned Property Ordinance This forces homeowners of abandoned properties to file notices with the Police Department They d be fined if they don t properly maintain those homes Responsible Banking Ordinance Under this measure lenders who do business with the city of San Diego have to give foreclosure and mortgage details The ordinance is expected to be in full swing within days The council intends to review the ordinance annually lily leung utsandiego com Twitter lilyshumleung",0

Investors have used all kinds of methods, from looking at various stock charts to examining cash flows to judging the stock based on the astrological sign of its company's establishment. Unfortunately, all methods have their good points and their bad. The most traditional method is by using fundamental analysis Ã¢â‚¬â€ judging the stock by the company's financial performance. This is done by using ratios. Ratios help identify a company s present and future risk and return both of which affect stock price Ratios also identify areas where the company needs improvement those parts of its operations that are running inefficiently and an unfavorable or unhealthy financial situation Often the ratios can indicate a potential problem long before the problem becomes unmanageable Another way that ratios can reveal relevant and essential information is when they are used as a comparison tool as the company compares itself against its competition By identifying how the competition has outperformed the company can adjust its operations to work more efficiently or more profitably There are about major ratios that investors consider Picking the most important ones is difficult as all of the ratios reveal needed information about the various aspects of the company However there is a general consensus that there are three ratios that rise to the top for comparison purposes as it applies to investing Earnings Per Share measures the profitability of the company This number is determined by dividing the after tax income or earnings available for common stockholders by the number of stock shares currently in the market place Generally an investor would like to see a company s EPS consistently rising year after year It is important to note that EPS does not mean that the investor will receive this money as a dividend Sometimes companies retain some of their earnings for future expansion and development so the dividends that are paid are determined after retained earnings are taken into account and may have no correlation to EPS The Price Earnings Ratio is found in most financial publications where stocks and stock prices are listed It is an important measure of the stockholder s belief in the company as investment potential As the ratio indicates the P E ratio is determined by dividing the price of the stock by its EPS If for example a stock has a P E ratio of it means that stockholders are willing to buy the stock for times its current earnings or for every earned as earnings per share Because the stock dividend does not compensate investors adequately for their investments stockholders buy the stock for another reason capital gains believing that the stock price will grow and result in a profit when the stock is eventually sold The P E ratio is an indicator of current investors opinion that such a rise in value will occur Many analysts look for stocks with a P E ratio in the s which may indicate that the stock has consistently grown in the past and may continue to do so Stocks with P Es below may be a good investment with a lot of growth potential and further analysis is warranted Those stocks above may be overpriced and ready for a correction It is important to note that the P E ratio alone does not signify that a stock should be bought or sold It is merely one indicator that should lead the investor to analysis Stockholders receive a return for their investment Return on Equity is a measure of that return It is found by dividing the company s net income listed on the Income Statement by the amount of money tied up in the company s equity account which is listed on the balance sheet as common stock or common stock equity and includes any treasury stock the company owns along with retained earnings Mary Luquette is an instructor in the B I Moody III College of Business at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette Mary Fox Luquette UL s B I Moody III College of Business",0

The social media post was evidence that Miller's view of law enforcement and his community had dramatically changed after his retirement from a two-decade military career in the Marine Corps, Ocala-based State Attorney Brad King told jurors Friday at the Osceola County Courthouse. He says he doesn t like cops much in polite language King said This is the clearest one that expresses what Mr Miller thought and goes along with what he did That is the reason why you should find him guilty of two counts of first degree murder Miller could face execution if convicted of the slayings of year old Sgt Richard Sam Howard and year old Officer Matthew Baxter The case is being prosecuted by King after former Gov Rick Scott reassigned dozens of capital cases to his office following Orange Osceola State Attorney Aramis Ayala s opposition to the death penalty During opening statements at the trial Miller s lawyers said they would not dispute that Miller was involved in the killings of Baxter and Howard But defense attorney J Edwin Mills argued Miller had been in a downward spiral since because he could not adjust to civilian life and suffered from depression anxiety and nightmares This was truly the perfect storm Mills told jurors He was homeless he didn t have a job he was heartbroken He was admonished for being a walk in at the VA three days before this crime was committed Mills told jurors his client was not guilty of a premeditated killing and asked them to return a verdict of second degree murder Prosecutors plan to argue Miller s anti government beliefs led to the calculated killing of the Kissimmee officers The state s first witness Maribel Gonzalez King testified the night of Aug Baxter was talking to her and two other men hanging out on the curb with beer near the intersection of Cypress and Palmway streets The officer was conducting a check into three suspicious people when Gonzalez King saw Miller suddenly drive up and start arguing with the officer He told Officer Baxter he wanted to talk to his sergeant Gonzalez King said Miller said he was tired of him messing with his people After Baxter called Howard to the scene Miller argued with them saying he feared for his life and telling them he had a license to carry a concealed weapon the witness said Gonzalez King said Howard told her and the other two men to leave immediately As she walked away she heard two gunshots a pause and then two more rounds fired A car door slammed and she heard a vehicle zoom away Gonzalez King testified Prosecutors said both officers were shot in the head and mouth area Police found their bodies parallel to each other with their hands at their side State Attorney Brad King said Miller was arrested later at Roscoe s a bar on Orange Blossom Trail with a knife and two guns Baxter died that night while Howard passed away the next day Miller s friends and family told the Orlando Sentinel he struggled with post traumatic stress disorder after his retirement His attorney told jurors Miller was a decorated Marine and completed a tour of duty in Afghanistan before his discharge in He worked as a defense contractor before moving back home to Central Florida where he deteriorated and was laid off from another job His long time girlfriend broke up with him and he started sleeping on a friend s couch Mills said As he self medicated with marijuana and alcohol he sought help from the VA in and started posting crazy things on Facebook his attorney argued A month before the shooting he was involuntarily committed under Florida s Baker Act after marching down the road with a high powered rifle while only wearing underwear When he was released after hours his guns were returned to him Mills told jurors The jury only heard testimony from two witnesses Friday Circuit Judge Greg A Tynan let them recess for several days to prepare as Hurricane Dorian heads toward Florida The judge said the trial could tentatively resume Wednesday mcordeiro orlandosentinel com or",0

The first stage of the development has been completed to a high standard and the units I have chosen are to be built during the second stage of development. I have recently received a letter from the developer stating they have run into financial difficulties due to the recent increases in construction costs. The letter says the developer has three options:

Compromise the standards, quality and size of the Stage 2 units. Cancel Stage altogether Obtain my agreement to increase the purchase price of the units The letter finishes with a statement that the developer is not prepared to finish the Stage units if it cannot achieve the same quality achieved in Stage I cannot afford nor do I want to pay any more money what can I do A Without seeing the entire letter and a copy of your agreement it is a little difficult to state with certainty what rights you may have However assuming your agreement is fairly standard and the letter does not contain any other qualifying statements there is one statement which is crucial to your situation The developer has said it is not prepared to complete the Stage units unless it can at least match the level of quality achieved in the completion of Stage And from the facts they cannot match the quality at the current contract price due to the increase in construction costs This appears to be a clear message that proceeding with Stage at the prices provided for under the agreement is no longer possible This decision seems to have been made by the developer who appears to believe there is no realistic alternative for completing Stage other than to seek support of Stage purchasers like yourself The courts are likely to hold that a reasonable person in your position would conclude that the developer does not intend to perform its obligations in a manner substantially consistent with the agreement In such circumstances when a party makes it clear by words or conduct that it does not intend to perform its obligations under a contract the party will be taken to have repudiated the contract A repudiation by the vendor entitles you to cancel the agreement pursuant to the Contractual Remedies Act You do not necessarily have to cancel the agreement but if you do decide to your intention to cancel must be clearly communicated to the other party This is best done in writing A breach of contract in this manner will also entitle you as the innocent party to maintain an action for damages We assume you have already paid a deposit towards the purchase of these units so you will be entitled to the return of the deposit upon cancellation unless your agreement states otherwise The alternate approach to accepting repudiation is to affirm the contract This will keep the contract alive and both parties will remain liable to perform their respective obligations under the contract This approach allows the developer the chance to perform in accordance with what had originally been agreed in the contract Should the developer then not be in a position to perform its obligations you may then be in a position to sue for specific performance By affirming the contract you will have no right to recover damages for breach of contract in respect of the earlier repudiation Whether an action amounts to repudiation is not a matter to be lightly inferred so you should seek advice from your solicitor before taking any action",0

CROP CONDITIONS FEBRUARY Unstable weather with little precipitation prevailed all over Ukraine from February It became slightly colder after February Air temperature fell on average to C at night even C in the north and to C in the daytime Abnormally warm weather was seen earlier this month when average temperature for the ten days was C above normal This caused active snow melting and thawing of the topsoil However according to agricultural meteorologists average daily air temperatures were below the biological limit for plant growth almost all across Ukraine from February therefore winter crops were dormant Apart from the temperature drop the snow cover restored on vast expanses in the same period This substantially protected crops against the negative impact of frost AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult According to observers cm of snow covered the ground in Kharkiv region As a result during frost occurrences of C soil temperature at the tillering node depth of winter crops did not drop lower than while the killing temperature equaled C A thin snow cover of just cm developed in the Steppe zone The topsoil froze to a depth of at most cm Minimum soil temperature at the tillering node depth of winter wheat reached At the same time the killing temperature for mid hardy cultivars of winter wheat was estimated at C as of February In the north of Ukraine the soil was frozen to a depth of cm on February The snow cover was cm high and rather compact ice crust developed in relief depressions under it The period of February saw the most favorable weather for winter crop plants because low air and soil temperatures with almost no snow in the fields could negatively impact viability of late sown winter wheat and barley which had one to three leaves per plant prior to overwintering However a crop survey showed that just single cultivars lost to of leaves with an intact tillering node Once plant growth resumes in spring such damages will be rapidly offset with an intense build up in the assimilation apparatus and will almost not affect the yield formation in winter crops Crop condition is generally satisfactory However in view of a significant portion of late sown winter crops and consequently their comparatively weak plant development before the winter the most favorable for them may be an early spring renewal of growth moderate temperatures and good soil moisture supply According to specialists winter wheat is at the nd stage of its plant development and winter triticale at the late nd and early rd stages of organogenesis The growing point is healthy with its length at mm In winter triticale it is mm long depending on the cultivar and predecessor The tillering coefficient varies within Winter rye is at the rd stage of organogenesis tillering Its growing point is healthy mm long The tillering coefficient is at The sugar content in tillering nodes of winter cereal plants varies within depending on the cultivar and predecessor According to specialists the content of soluble carbohydrates in soft wheat and rye is still enough for normal overwintering It enables wheat and rye plants to endure temperatures of up to C and respectively Durum winter wheat plants contained of soluble sugars indicating a frost hardiness decline to C Winter barley contains of sugars that poses a threat of winterkill if soil temperature falls to C at the tillering node depth In the northeast of Ukraine winter wheat of early and optimum planting dates contains on average of soluble sugars in tillering nodes In general the sugar content dropped in all cultivars This state of winter cereals requires constant monitoring Special attention should be paid to the sugar consumption dynamics the state of growing points soil temperature at the tillering node depth and emergence and spread of diseases Once the snow cover is gone winter cereals should be examined to determine their need for nitrogen fertilizers In the course of multi year studies and observations it has been established that in case of optimum overwintering conditions plants in well developed crops are to be sampled for analysis on the following three dates January February and March In case of adverse weather additional samples should be taken every time after significant temperature drops a long stay of compact ice crust and after long thaws An important factor influencing this year s condition of winter cereals will be the time of spring growth resumption If this happens from March with gradually increasing above zero air temperatures even non tillered crops will be able to increase the density of productive stalks due to spring tillering processes If spring growth resumes at the long term average period late March April with a rapid temperature build up the state of sparse crops will not improve and winter crop yields will likely decline Out of the planted Th ha winter crops for grain emerged on Th ha by February of these plantings are in good condition

In isolated areas murine rodents are populating the field margins Crops are slightly infested by Septoria blight and powdery mildew up to of plants GRAIN MARKET NEWS Topic of the week Does Europe need Ukrainian corn The research conducted by UkrAgroConsult shows that fundamental change in global markets unfortunately has not virtually influenced the strategy of the agrarian sector of Ukraine The main attention is still focused on the increase in grain production volume while low attention is given to profitability and efficiency of this industry UkrAgroConsult has already analyzed the situation when European countries reduced the imports of Ukrainian corn in the season compared to last season Rich own harvest as well as import duties have provoked the reduction of Ukrainian grain supply to the EU During October January Ukraine shipped only MMT of corn in this direction in comparison with MMT during the same time period last season In the context of significant devaluation Ukraine needs high export revenues Experience of the previous ten years shows that customers from the EU are quite unreliable importers and their activity depends on level of their own production Besides the USA claims a great interest in this market and currently discussing the creation of a free trade zone with EU There is an opinion in the market that old economies are trying to strengthen by means of limiting the access of young economies to their territory Therefore the trend of globalization which has been so much discussed in recent years is currently not so popular Quite the opposite there are signs of regionalization of the world economic community The decline of crude oil prices may boost the trend for the growing role of regional markets besides the EU is a good example of such a regional market In view of cheapness of traditional fuel bioethanol production becomes less profitable In early February ethanol stocks in the USA broke the two year record contributing to further reduction of prices and profitability of processing corn and other raw materials into ethanol Even before the collapse of crude oil prices a trend of decline of industrial grain consumption was observed in the USA Currently this trend may become a strongly pronounced tendency The preserved trend of production increase may aggravate the problem In other words the export potential of US corn production industry continues growing and competition for buyers is also rising Stiffer competition creates new methods and forms of struggle for markets Production and industrial consumption of corn in the USA MMT In this context the prices of grain and oilseeds continue decreasing In mid February the USDA published their first price forecast for grain of the harvest In particular it is expected that AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult farmers prices for corn will average bushel in the season This price is lower than in the current season and the lowest since The prices for soybean will reach the nine year minimum level according to the forecast It is also difficult for Ukraine to struggle for market outlets but its position of corn exporter is gradually strengthening not least because of geographic regional proximity to consumers At least it was until Corn exports KMT Certainly under such conditions the main battle will be for payable markets which show growth in consumption or at least its stabilization China is the first country which is traditionally regarded as a country of rising demand The trend of growing demand in this country is strongly pronounced though grain stocks are still considerable The similar situation is observed in other Asian countries although the demand is much lower there Experts of UkrAgroConsult have appraised the situation and come to conclusion that increase of demand and main battle for market share will develop in Asia region regionalization again Corn consumption MMT A positive point for such commodity exporters like Ukraine lies in changing policy of China in agriculture China intends to reduce grain production in favor of livestock vegetable farming and other industries producing goods with high added value This may provoke some increase in grain imports However the competition for customers will be also severe Ukraine should put most efforts to fulfill the existing and make new contracts in this market In the end we would like to point out three main competitive advantages which have traditionally supported the position of Ukrainian grain low prices GMO free products and favorable logistics These are those advantages which will help Ukraine to win the strategic struggle in changing business conditions Elizabeth Malyshko Grain market expert UkrAgroConsult AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult Weekly summary World market Wheat CBOT Egypt s tender to purchase wheat was the main event of last week Initially GASC intended to buy US wheat using a special tranche However the grain was not purchased due to high prices This fact proved low competitiveness of US grain On the other hand the international tender held by Egypt demonstrated high competitive power of European grain Taking advantage of relatively low prices a number of countries continue purchasing wheat in tenders which predominantly confirm the attractiveness of European especially French wheat FranceAgriMer has raised the estimate of French wheat exports outside the EU due to high supplies to Egypt in the current season The export is expected to reach MMT MMT in the January forecast For the first time this season will make the EU the leading exporter of wheat to world markets According to USDA estimates the EU will export about MMT of wheat in the current season shifting the USA to the second place with exports at MMT Volatility of quotations at CBOT reflected the Egyptian defeat of US wheat only partially Speculative and weather factors as well as rising quotations of corn appeared to be bullish factors Consequently last week wheat futures even managed to increase EU FranceAgriMer has released a forecast in which the planted area of soft wheat in France for the harvest will be expanded by to Ml ha It is also expected that the planted area of hard wheat will increase by to Ml ha It should be noted that there is lack of hard wheat supply in France this season which is compensated by imports particularly from Canada Canadian hard wheat exports to Western Europe have increased by about to MMT Canada has significantly increased wheat exports to Middle East Europe and South America During the five months of the current season Canadian exporters have supplied MMT of soft wheat to foreign buyers This is more than during the same time period in the season Asian countries were the main destinations of Canadian wheat exports Wheat supply to Middle East has increased considerably by in comparison with the last season to Western Europe by and to South America by India This year gross crop of grain in India will decrease to MMT forecasts the Ministry of Agriculture Last year India gathered a record high grain harvest MMT The production will decline mainly due to less precipitation during the monsoon season Wheat production in India is expected to reach MMT which is close to last year s level MMT Corn CBOT Last week CBOT corn quotations increased by T due to high export sales during the previous week Information about the possible reduction of corn planted area in favor of soybean and other agricultural crops somewhat supported the market at the end of last week Nevertheless fundamentally CBOT corn prices continue to suffer from high global supply AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult Argentina Rains in some regions of Argentina delayed harvesting of new crop corn By February farmers had gathered corn from Th ha or of the planted area Recent rains are favorable for plantings of corn which harvest time has not come yet According to the forecast of Buenos Aires Exchange gross crop of corn may reach MMT This is less than the record level of the season USDA has published its first forecast of planted area for the harvest It is expected that the acreage of major agri crops will decrease due to low prices Corn planted area will be reduced to Ml acres Ml acres compared with the current season wheat planted area to Ml acres Ml acres Farmers prices for corn are forecasted to average bushel in the season This price is lower than in the current season and the lowest since Besides according to USDA report in December the consumption of corn for ethanol production increased by in the USA In December Ml bushels of corn was used for ethanol and spirit production compared to Ml bushels in November and Ml bushels in October Spain According to the Ministry of Agriculture imports of corn to the country decreased by The largest suppliers of wheat in December were the following France KMT the UK KMT and Sweden KMT Ukraine has taken the first place among corn suppliers KMT In in Republic of South Africa the gross crop of corn reached a record high level for the last years and reached MMT This year a significant reduction of corn production is expected in South Africa due to dry weather which is now observed in major corn producing regions Facts and Rumors Russia According to the Ministry of Agriculture about Ml ha of the planted Ml ha of winter crops are in poor condition due to the fact that plantings are thinned and emerged before the cold snap The forecast of the Ministry of Agriculture is in a wide range in grain production may reach from MMT with a large percentage of killed winter crops to MMT China is ready to extend corn trade with Ukraine by almost says the Minister of Agrarian Policy Alexey Pavlenko Confirmation from China has come owing to successful implementation of a challenging contract with China Ukraine Market operators estimate that Ukraine exported KMT of grain from ports during February including KMT of

the brink of being stopped Reports about the construction of new oilseed crushing plants increasingly often appear in the market lately But this time contrary to the previous events it is planned to build crushers not for sunseed since sunseed processing capacities have long exceeded MMT a year The matter concerns soybean crushing If the construction plans have been announced back in early everything would look logical and correct in view of booming soybean production in Ukraine along with similarly booming world demand for processed products However the plans for building new plants look a bit bizarre this season in the current circumstances The point is that a paradoxical situation has developed in the market to date with a bumper soybean crop the existing crushers may just stop operation Domestic soybean prices increase every day exporters already pay UAH for soybeans in ports and this price may be no more topical next week The current soybean price is just unaffordable for many crushers and it is actually impossible to compete with exporters because soybean meal cake sales are aimed mostly to the domestic market Therefore unlike exporters they receive revenues in Hryvnias not dollars AgriNews Kyiv Feb UkrAgroConsult To purchase soybeans at the market price soybean meal cake prices must be higher than now In turn this will entail growth of poultry meat prices and then in chain order a decline in poultry demand from consumers a decrease in poultry meat production a fall in demand for meal cake etc However apart from sky high soybea,0

As soon as the mercury nosedives, it seems homeowners prefer to cocoon themselves inside their homes, rather than get out and sell them, believing spring or autumn are the best times to go to market. Of course like a lot of conventional wisdom this is something of a half truth Unquestionably the volume of houses on the market tails away as does price growth with more lower priced properties below on the market However according to agents less stock between and of what usually comes on the market in the peak seasons of spring and autumn does not necessarily translate into fewer purchasers Buyer advocate Michael Ramsay estimates a dip of only LJ Hooker s Brigitte Blackman sees no shortage of buyers either If you have less supply and high demand you can have more bidders on a property she said In fact Ms Blackman strongly believes the beginning and middle periods of the year are more opportune for vendors because there is less competition Buyers come rain hail or shine weather doesn t affect people buying she said Mr Ramsay who also offers vendor advocacy asks why not strike while the iron is hot even if the weather isn t The days are shorter and colder but at least you know you re selling in a market that s still strong he said It may not be the case in spring Australian Property Monitor s Andrew Wilson warns there are signs the market might be waning price growth has eased over the past couple of quarters There s a lot of confidence and energy in the market but affordability barriers are kicking in moderating price growth and investors are less enthusiastic given rising vacancy rates and falling yields Wilson says Selling in winter also means that as a buyer in spring you are cashed up and ready to buy when there is more housing stock from which to choose It s the perfect scenario Ms Blackman said Agents also point out some houses simply lend themselves better to a winter sale They might be north facing enjoy a cosy ambience have fireplaces heated floors or an evergreen garden Cold comfort How to prepare your house to sell in winter Make sure the house is warm check the heating works and be prepared to add extra heat Create a cosy inviting atmosphere light a fire add woolly blankets and cushions to beds couches scent with baking aromas Let in as much light as possible prune trees clean windows open curtains Use mirrors to lighten rooms Maximise artificial lighting to remove any dark corners Clean up the garden mow the lawn Enlist a stylist to add warmth colour and homeliness Repaint where needed to add brightness Hold inspections when the sun is at its peak or in the evening if it s better Check everything s in good repair",0

"PILOT MOUNTAIN Ã¢â‚¬â€ Town officials hope to keep town residents' taxes at the same level of 58 cents as they work on the 2015-16 fiscal year budget, but if town finances can't be handled at a flat level, then residents may be looking at a tax increase.

In advance of the budget process, town commissioners and staff are asking the county commissioners to extend the Pilot Knob Volunteer Fire Department's fire tax district to include town residents. While those in town have been serviced by the volunteer department since the merger of the town fire department several years ago, the town's general fund has been paying the fire department rather than residents having to pay a separate tax.","PILOT MOUNTAIN Ã¢â‚¬â€ Town officials hope to keep town residents' taxes at the same level of 58 cents as they work on the 2015-16 fiscal year budget, but if town finances can't be handled at a flat level, then residents may be looking at a tax increase.

In advance of the budget process, town commissioners and staff are asking the county commissioners to extend the Pilot Knob Volunteer Fire Department's fire tax district to include town residents. While those in town have been serviced by the volunteer department since the merger of the town fire department several years ago, the town's general fund has been paying the fire department rather than residents having to pay a separate tax. The town board plans to begin building its new fiscal year budget based on a cent property tax rate and a cent fire tax according to town officials who spoke at the Tuesday night meeting of the Pilot Mountain Board of Commissioners Mayor Dwight Atkins explained With all the pressures we have from the legislature it will be very hard to do but if we were holding everything flat no changes then essentially we d be at and the fire tax would be four So people would still be paying Those pressures include the state ending privilege license fees and other actions that could adversely affect the town s revenues meaning a possible need to increase the town s tax rate officials said Eliminating the pass through funds such as the fire tax also reduces cash flow issues for the town The more we pass out that raises how much we have to keep in accordance with the government It helps our cash reserves not be restricted said Commissioner Kim Quinn The fire tax is separate and independent and the fire tax is based on the cost of funding and providing fire services The Pilot Knob Fire Department has done an amazing job with their finances making sure they have the equipment they need and making sure they are keeping the fire insurance ratings as low as possible said Town Manager Amanda Reid The fire department s board of directors also favors this move which will have to have final approval from the county commissioners Chet Jessup chairman of the fire department board said We will get our money faster and it will be more evenly divided We as a board have already voted and approved it The town board voted in favor of the expanded district with Commissioners Linda Needham and Gary Bell opposing Diane Blakemore may be reached at or on twitter PilotReporter",0
